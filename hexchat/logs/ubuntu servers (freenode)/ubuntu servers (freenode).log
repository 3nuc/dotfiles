cze 21 18:36:25 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
cze 21 18:36:25 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
cze 21 18:36:25 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the

cze 21 18:36:25 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
cze 21 18:36:25 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
