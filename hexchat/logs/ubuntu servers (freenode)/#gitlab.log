Sep 16 11:24:36 <threenuc>	Hi. I have Gitlab community hosted on one server and I have another AWS EC2 VM that runs ci/cd (currently has jenkins installed). I read over the Gitlab Runner docs and it seems as if Gitlab really doesn
Sep 16 11:25:21 <threenuc>	(whoops) really doesn't like it when you try to set up a runner outside the server on which gitlab itself is installed. For example there's this ssh runner executor that has reduced features
Sep 16 11:26:32 <threenuc>	So is there any other way than having all runners on the same server as gitlab?
Sep 16 11:29:53 <D0han>	its not even advised to have runner on same server as gitlab
Sep 16 11:30:14 <D0han>	there is no penalty for running it on separate system
Sep 16 11:31:47 <D0han>	you may want to take a look at runner with docker
Sep 16 11:47:55 <Toxmi>	I want to locally checkout a merge-request. The gilab documentation gives some tips. But since I'm beginner, I want to know signle/double command manualy.
Sep 16 11:48:28 <Toxmi>	I've a private repo and is `git fetch origin/merge-request/3` is a good practice?
Sep 16 11:49:01 <Toxmi>	I don't want to setup that mr and alias thing (https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/merge_requests/index.md#checkout-merge-requests-locally) since above my git level understanding...
Sep 16 11:52:10 <Toxmi>	wow, gitlab is amazing. The help was just on merge-request page....(using git fetch)
Sep 16 11:52:57 <Toxmi>	Now, when I check and everything was correct I merge it to develope branch and then push it up. Done. Is this a good practice among community?
Sep 16 11:53:36 <D0han>	yes, or just push a button on web ui
Sep 16 12:06:05 <Toxmi>	D0han:Oh, thanks.
Sep 16 12:06:22 <Toxmi>	I did that and it worked. But I couldn't remvoe the branch locally
Sep 16 12:07:11 <Toxmi>	I get this warning: not deleting branch 'fix_blah' that is not yet merged to 'refs/remotes/origin/fix_blah', even though it is merged with HEAD.
Sep 16 12:07:22 <Toxmi>	error: The branch 'fix_blah' is not fully merged.
Sep 16 12:07:46 <Toxmi>	Before this I did `git push origin dev' command did I miss something? It seems this message is not complete.
Sep 16 12:07:56 <Toxmi>	I've missed somethng here.
Sep 16 12:15:34 <threenuc>	@D0han welp I just installed the docker executor on my ec2 and it's working flawlessly.  I assumed since I saw "ssh" as an executor option it was the only remote one possible and assumed all the other ones were local. thanks for your help :)
Sep 16 12:19:29 <D0han>	you are on a cloud, so maybe take a look into autoscaling runners - docker+machine or kubernetes possibly

Sep 16 16:19:47 <threenuc>	Is using tagged runners solely for deployments an ok pattern? I'm making a proof of concept app and have an AWS EC2 VM with one docker runner that does all the CI (building etc.). Now I want to deploy to the very same machine that has the runner. But I can't just do `script: - ./deploy.sh` because it will deploy to the docker container. Would creating a new gitlab runner with a shell executor side by side with my runner with docker 
Sep 16 16:19:47 <threenuc>	executor be ok here?
Sep 16 16:20:25 <threenuc>	I would just create a tagged deploy job so it would only ever run on the shell runner

Sep 17 10:35:44 <mgolisch>	how would you execute it not running in gitlab-runner?
Sep 17 10:58:00 <threenuc>	In my proposed solution I have two runners on the same machine: shell runner and docker runner. I can't execute it on a docker runner because it will deploy to docker. I want it to deploy to my main machine (docker host). Would that work?
Sep 17 10:58:49 <mgolisch>	deploy what?
Sep 17 11:07:24 <mgolisch>	you can add additional bind mounts in the runner config file
Sep 17 11:09:39 <mgolisch>	https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#the-persistent-storage
Sep 17 11:26:56 <Toxmi>	I want to checkout the merge-request to my (private) repo. The gitlab gives me something like this: git fetch "git@gitlab.com:user0005/FGProject.git" "feature_x"
Sep 17 11:27:14 <Toxmi>	But it doesn't work for me. When I try to run it gives me this:
Sep 17 11:27:58 <Toxmi>	The project you were looking for could not be found.
Sep 17 11:28:06 <Toxmi>	fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Sep 17 11:28:42 <Toxmi>	yesterday, it was much easier something like 'git fetch origin/sth`.
Sep 17 11:28:58 <Toxmi>	I don't know what the problem is or how to debug it.
Sep 17 12:54:18 <andi_>	hello i've got a question regarding git submodules... i have a repo, lets call it "code" in this repo i've got a .gitlab-ci.yml running. in this gitlab-ci.yml i want to import/call/use another git repo within the same server. so i created a .gitmodules file and added the repo i need. where is this repo if i start a new ci/cd runner?
Sep 17 12:57:31 <andi_>	i also cannot see a Cloning repository in my runner log
Sep 17 13:00:50 <andi_>	what i am expecting is a folder inside my code runner working dir.. something like code/pulled_submodule
Sep 17 13:10:08 <mgolisch>	https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/git_submodules.html#using-git-submodules-in-your-ci-jobs
Sep 17 13:10:31 <mgolisch>	looks like you need to tell the runner to checkout the submodules for you
Sep 17 13:13:17 <Toxmi>	Considerning this scenario, there is a private repo with an owner and a developer. The developer fork the repo and create a feature locally then push it back to his own forked repo which then he fill a merge request.
Sep 17 13:13:56 <Toxmi>	Now the owner, wants to checkout the merge request. However, this doesn't work with the command generated by gitlab (git fetch git@user/....).
Sep 17 13:14:57 <Toxmi>	I don't know if this is a standard practice or not. But the workflow is the above mentioned scenario however, I can not checkout the merge-requests locally on my repo.
Sep 17 13:15:30 <mgolisch>	does your user have access to said repo?
Sep 17 13:15:31 <Toxmi>	As far as I get it, I should do `git fetch origin`, then checkout to origin/the_mr_feature. Right?
Sep 17 13:15:52 <Toxmi>	mgolisch:No, but the user is a member of owner's repo.
Sep 17 13:16:24 <Toxmi>	So you mean the developer which have forked the repo, it should give access to owner as well.
Sep 17 13:24:19 <Toxmi>	It's not the permission problem. Since using  adding this to origin config: fetch = +refs/merge-requests/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/merge-requests/*
Sep 17 13:24:38 <Toxmi>	Now I can checkout those merges. But withotu it I can not. So this is not permission problem.
Sep 17 13:25:06 <Toxmi>	*checkout those merge-requests
Sep 17 13:27:15 <Toxmi>	So based on a #git user, the problem is probably due to some reason which Gitlab doesn't advertise the merge-requests or git fetch the repo doesn't check the merge-requests branches.
Sep 17 13:30:10 <andi_>	mgolisch: where do i add the line? git@gitlab.com:secret-group/my-project.git
Sep 17 13:30:38 <andi_>	or in other words, where do i tell the runner to check out the repo?
Sep 17 13:32:04 <andi_>	do i add a git clone in the before_script?
Sep 17 14:13:36 <andi_>	how do i add the ssh-key created for the gitlab-runner user to the gitlab server?
Sep 17 14:13:45 <andi_>	where do i need to copy the .pub to?
Sep 17 14:18:07 <badeball>	My impression is that stages / jobs is a merely a constrained DAG, which can be achieved using exactly that. Why would one use needs: togeether with stage: ? As indicated here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/65504/designs
Sep 17 15:23:26 <Toxmi>	is it OK in the forking workflow, the devloper merges it feature to dev branch and then purll request the origin/dev to usptream/dev?
Sep 17 17:37:26 <s34n>	certifiable: aside from tls, is there a reason to limit a gitlab instance to a single url?
Sep 17 18:03:42 <leela52452>	what is the best way to create a pr for a github repo using gitlab web interface, not using cli
Sep 17 18:05:53 <leela52452>	what is the right way to import githu

Sep 17 21:00:59 <lfamorim>	Hello, how to report a bug at www.gitlab.com?
Sep 17 21:01:15 <lfamorim>	I'm having serious issues in a paid acc trying to access the dashboard.
Sep 17 21:04:57 <ahf>	hello!
Sep 17 21:06:02 <ahf>	we are considered moving a set of projects from trac to gitlab and we are looking a bit at some of our requirements and there is (at least) one of them where i don't seem to be able to see if it is possible: would it be possible for new users to have all comments on tickets being required to be moderated at first?
Sep 17 21:06:17 <ahf>	we can create the user via the API if that is needed for this to happen, even without the default sign up page for a public instance.
Sep 17 21:06:26 <ahf>	i just cannot see any kind of moderation features anywhere
Sep 17 21:08:12 <ahf>	one option i could see would be to have a different form where the user when writing their first ticket does it via a form that uses the api to: 1) create the user account with the email they specify in the form and 2) create the issue, with the confidential bit set, with the newly created user
Sep 17 21:33:01 <s34n>	I have two interface on my gitlab host. git activity through one interface works fine. git activity through the other results is 404 errors
Sep 17 21:33:54 <s34n>	in both cases, git interacts via http
Sep 17 21:35:34 <s34n>	on the disfunctional interface, I see an HTTP get with a 301 redirect followed by a new GET with a 200 response
Sep 17 21:36:13 <s34n>	The I see a POST to git-upload-pack which results in a 404
Sep 17 21:36:21 <s34n>	s/The/Then/
Sep 17 21:37:24 <s34n>	why do I get a 404 when the request comes through a particular interface?
