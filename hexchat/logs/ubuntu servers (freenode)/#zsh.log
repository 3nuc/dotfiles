Aug 31 11:46:35 <ongo>	how do I get that selection menu with suggestions?
Aug 31 11:46:44 <ongo>	is this an oh my zsh thing?
Aug 31 11:46:55 <ongo>	like highlighting your selections
Aug 31 11:53:26 <ongo>	figured out it was this: zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
Aug 31 17:48:18 <leah2>	how can i use print -P %D with a different timezone?
Aug 31 17:48:59 <Pepe_vulgaris>	leah2: did you try TZ="whatever" print -P %D?
Aug 31 17:49:06 <leah2>	yes, that doesnt seem to work
Aug 31 17:49:53 <leah2>	ok, fun:
Aug 31 17:50:15 <leah2>	> ( TZ=GMT print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 17:50:18 <machabot>	leah2: 15:50
Aug 31 17:50:32 <leah2>	> ( TZ=DST print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 17:50:33 <machabot>	leah2: 15:50
Aug 31 17:50:41 <leah2>	> ( export TZ=DST; print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 17:50:42 <machabot>	leah2: 15:50
Aug 31 17:50:53 <Mikachu>	even if you set it before, you have to export it for it to take effct
Aug 31 17:50:57 <Mikachu>	DST isn't a valid value though
Aug 31 17:51:02 <leah2>	yeah i noticed
Aug 31 17:51:14 <leah2>	but usually  X=Y CMD is equal to export X=Y; CMD
Aug 31 17:51:37 <Mikachu>	i think there was a thread about this recently
Aug 31 18:10:44 <waterkip>	> (  TZ=America/Curacao print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 18:10:45 <machabot>	waterkip: 16:10
Aug 31 18:11:36 <waterkip>	tres weird, works locally
Aug 31 18:17:38 <m0viefreak>	> TZ=America/Curacao; export TZ; (  TZ=America/Curacao print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )

Aug 31 18:18:04 <m0viefreak>	this is the thread, Mikachu
Aug 31 18:19:19 <m0viefreak>	> (  TZ=America/Curacao; export TZ; print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 18:19:19 <machabot>	m0viefreak: 16:19
Aug 31 18:19:23 <m0viefreak>	weird
Aug 31 18:20:35 <m0viefreak>	hmm, it silently seems to fall back to UTC if if the time zone is not known, which is probably the case on machabot
Aug 31 18:21:07 <m0viefreak>	> (  TZ=UTC-1; export TZ; print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 18:21:07 <machabot>	m0viefreak: 17:20
Aug 31 18:23:52 <waterkip>	> (  TZ=UTC-4 print -P '%D{%H:%M}' )
Aug 31 18:23:52 <machabot>	waterkip: 16:23
Aug 31 18:24:10 <m0viefreak>	it needs to be exported, see the mailing thread linked above
Aug 31 18:24:15 <Mikachu>	i think the takeaway is "don't do that"
Aug 31 18:24:39 <waterkip>	m0viefreak: it works on my own box
Aug 31 18:24:55 <m0viefreak>	yes, because in your interactive shell TZ probably already is export beforehand
Aug 31 18:25:07 <m0viefreak>	and your assignment just changes the exported parameter
Aug 31 18:25:11 <m0viefreak>	its a bit of a pitfall
Aug 31 18:25:43 <m0viefreak>	> echo $+TZ
Aug 31 18:25:44 <machabot>	m0viefreak: 0
Aug 31 18:25:55 <m0viefreak>	on machabot, no TZ exists yet

Aug 31 18:26:34 <waterkip>	aha
Aug 31 18:45:51 <MrAureliusR>	is there a separate channel for oh-my-zsh?
Aug 31 18:46:01 <MrAureliusR>	ah, found it
Aug 31 19:23:42 <Orbstheorem>	Hello! Is there any way to specify a here-string, but connect stdin to the terminal afterwards?
Aug 31 19:24:22 <Orbstheorem>	e.g. `sh <<< exec bash` and keep the underlaying bash open.
Aug 31 19:27:05 <psprint>	What does fc -e do?
Aug 31 19:29:39 <nedbat>	psprint: yeah, the man page shows "-e ename" but fails to describe what it does
Aug 31 19:34:20 <ft>	It names the editor to use. And yes, that's documented.
Aug 31 19:35:59 <nedbat>	ft: do you see what I mean about the "fc" section of "man zshall"?
Aug 31 19:36:39 <nedbat>	ft: I see: it mentions ename again, but not "-e", so it's easy to miss.
Aug 31 19:39:58 <ft>	Some parts of zshbuiltins(1), which is the part of zshall(1) you're mentioning, require close reading. Notably fc and typeset (and its variants). It is pretty complete though.
Aug 31 19:41:13 <ft>	That being said, if you think something needs clarification: This is an open source project. ;)
Aug 31 19:49:04 <nedbat>	ft: open source, with some unfamiliar conventions
Aug 31 19:50:32 <nedbat>	ft: wish me luck: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/pull/37
Aug 31 20:22:08 <Orbstheorem>	nedbat: is the change at line 159 intended?
Aug 31 20:22:29 <nedbat>	Orbstheorem: oops
Aug 31 20:22:46 <nedbat>	Orbstheorem: I searched for "ename" and hit return I guess.
Aug 31 20:23:49 <Orbstheorem>	nedbat: Always diff upstream and local before submitting a PR :)
Aug 31 20:24:05 <nedbat>	Orbstheorem: i did the whole thing on github, but i can check the results better
Aug 31 20:24:17 <Orbstheorem>	Reading from a reviewer's perspective usually prevents a lot of unnecessary ping-pong
Aug 31 20:24:48 <nedbat>	Orbstheorem: fixed.
Aug 31 20:24:59 <Orbstheorem>	nedbat: You probably wanna fixup that commit x)
Aug 31 20:26:30 <nedbat>	Orbstheorem: fixed fixed

Sep 03 14:03:03 <leah2>	sounds like wrong $TERM setting
Sep 03 14:04:52 <Marlocov>	I think it's a UTF-8 issue

Sep 04 11:44:56 <collector1871>	hi all, any idea how can i remove oh-my-zsh ?
Sep 04 11:45:46 <wreo>	collector1871, oh-my-zsh comes with an "uninstall_oh_my_zsh" function that might work for you.
Sep 04 11:47:38 <collector1871>	ok, done
Sep 04 11:48:26 <wreo>	nice
Sep 04 11:49:05 <collector1871>	now i am going install `oh-my-zsh-git` on Arch linux (i had this, but from manual installation)
Sep 04 11:56:50 <collector1871>	other question : how can i use plugins from oh-my-zsh ?
Sep 04 12:01:01 <collector1871>	ah, got it
Sep 04 15:00:32 <astronavt>	can someone help me understand what ;& does in case/esac? "IF the list that is executed is terminated with ;& rather than ;;, the following list is also executed."
Sep 04 15:00:50 <astronavt>	an example would be great
Sep 04 15:02:10 <meh`>	astronavt, sounds like fall-through to me

Sep 05 16:37:20 <gehn>	my google fu is failing me, where do I find the list of definitions of what each \ escape char is or does, like \n and \t
Sep 05 16:37:34 <gehn>	I mean, I know what those two are, but looking for the full list
Sep 05 16:38:15 <gehn>	all my searches relating to backslashes or escape sequences or escape chars haven't yet yielded the results I want
Sep 05 16:41:32 <henrebotha[m]>	gehn: man zshbuiltins, search for 'echo', there's a list of which ones are recognised by echo specifically
Sep 05 16:41:36 <henrebotha[m]>	Not sure if that's what you want
Sep 05 16:41:55 <phy1729>	man zshmisc   QUOTING points to print in man zshbuiltins
Sep 05 16:42:50 <gehn>	yes that's the one
Sep 05 16:42:51 <gehn>	thanks
Sep 05 16:44:44 <gehn>	really I just want the feature where new tabs open in the same CWD/PWD as the previous tab
Sep 05 16:45:15 <gehn>	but on mac with zsh this appears not to be working for me
Sep 05 16:45:19 <gehn>	all the solutions I've found on SO etc have not worked so far
Sep 05 16:45:48 <gehn>	I saw something about that Terminall.app "sends" the PWD to the new tab via escape sequences (or something like that)
Sep 05 16:45:53 <gehn>	but my searching also hasn't found documentation on how this works or how to use it
Sep 05 16:46:47 <gehn>	one solution consists of this command
Sep 05 16:46:48 <gehn>	print -Pn "\e]2; %~/ \a"
Sep 05 16:46:59 <gehn>	but I'm struggling to understand what it does or how it's supposed to accomplish what I want
Sep 05 16:47:12 <gehn>	I think I understand the component parts, but how does that translate into what I want?
Sep 05 16:47:54 <gehn>	\e2]; appears to set the title bar (I guess?) and %~ is pwd and \a is bell
Sep 05 16:47:58 <gehn>	but... why tho?

Sep 05 17:05:11 <astronavt>	of course then youre putting trust in a community-maintained package repo entirely separate from redhat
Sep 05 17:05:37 <SuperLag>	right
Sep 05 17:05:42 <astronavt>	i've also built zsh from source, it's not hard and doesn't require a lot of dependencies

Sep 05 17:18:18 <gehn>	my ~/.bash_profile is empty
Sep 05 17:18:31 <gehn>	and I don't see anything custom or related to this in either /etc/profile or /etc/bash_profile
Sep 05 17:18:38 <gehn>	er, /etc/bashrc that is
Sep 05 17:18:42 <gehn>	so how does bash do it?
Sep 05 17:18:47 <gehn>	and why doesn't zsh do the same?
Sep 05 17:27:38 <astronavt>	gehn well what do you want?
Sep 05 17:27:52 <astronavt>	bone-stock bash is comparable to bone-stock zsh

Sep 09 10:21:38 <osse>	Interesting. I copied _mere from /usr/share/... to my $fpath dir and changed it. The result is identical to what I had, but it works.

Sep 09 19:50:43 <Zoohouse>	Hello everyone. I'm having an issue when creating a symbolic link to .oh-my-zsh dir. ln -s zsh/dracula.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/dracula.zsh-theme creats a broken link. If I run the same command but pointing to ~/ then it works.
Sep 09 20:18:07 <Mikachu>	!omz
Sep 09 20:18:08 <machabot>	"omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.
Sep 09 20:20:27 <trucy>	I finally disabled omz
Sep 09 20:21:14 <trucy>	At least I learned that I can configure the history to keep the history across sessions
Sep 09 20:22:16 <Zoohouse>	got it
Sep 09 20:47:13 <Zoohouse>	I have bindkey -v in my .zshrc file. Restarted the terminal and the keybinding isn't working as expected. Example, I'll type "This is a test" and press <esc><0> and the curser doesn't move to the start of the line. Also, <esc><b> moves back by one word and puts me into INSERT MODE.
Sep 09 22:12:23 <glik22>	my .zshrc file defines a function. i want to create a shell script that uses that function, but it says "command not found"
Sep 09 22:13:00 <glik22>	what's the best approach? should i just run "source ~/.zshrc" as my first command?
Sep 09 22:13:49 <psprint>	glik22: you would have to define the function in ~/.zshenv or source the zshrc, but best will be to make it an autoload, i.e. a separate file function, add the dir to $fpath and use `autoload the-funct'
Sep 09 22:24:58 <glik22>	psprint: it's actually an oh-my-zsh plugin, so not quite sure how that works with autoload
Sep 09 22:39:57 <psprint>	you've said it's a function
Sep 10 04:58:01 <nt0>	what is the recommended way to store a custom zsh theme and append fpath?  my first thought is to create a ~/.zsh/themes directory and then "export FPATH=~/.zsh/themes:$FPATH" in .zshrc
Sep 10 04:59:39 <llua>	fpath+=( dir )

Sep 11 12:16:33 <FoH>	anything in there that might be bypassing that line?
Sep 11 12:17:13 <FoH>	or a  zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=false  somewhere?

Sep 11 15:10:55 <elphe>	hi. vim has an option called 'showcmd' that allows for keys/commands to be displayed in statusline as they are entered. hoping to do something similiar in zsh where by there would be an indication if <esc> had been tapped and the shell is waiting to see if its the first part of a multi-char sequence. is there some kind of public flag that registers if the sheel is in waiting for keytimeout?

Sep 17 16:09:01 <machabot>	llua: -P a -P b -P c
Sep 17 16:43:02 <phy1729>	I wonder which is faster
Sep 17 17:59:23 <gdrc>	i am experiencing very slow behaviour with zsh -- https://streamable.com/38la9
Sep 17 17:59:28 <gdrc>	any idea of what could it be
Sep 17 18:06:22 <llua>	your config
Sep 17 18:31:15 <gdrc>	llua: i'm using ohmyzsh only with git plugin
Sep 17 18:45:25 <llua>	k
Sep 17 18:45:34 <llua>	doesn't change the answer
Sep 17 18:45:41 <llua>	!omz
Sep 17 18:45:41 <machabot>	"omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.
Sep 17 18:47:02 <tos9>	Why can't I figure out the right level of quoting or nonquoting to get the last argument in `ssh host sudo -u user 'grep -v " \*\*\* " /dir/*/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d").log'` to get globbed on the remote host
Sep 17 18:48:11 <llua>	type the command like you normally would, without ssh host, invoke the quote-line widget, prefix ssh host
Sep 17 18:50:04 <tos9>	aha, ok, didn't know about that widget cool
Sep 17 18:50:16 <tos9>	I think part of my issue is just preventing the glob until after the setuid
Sep 17 18:50:31 <tos9>	is the best way to do that just using zsh -c as the sudo command
Sep 17 18:50:56 <tos9>	i.e. `sudo -u user zsh -c 'ls /dir/*'`, if I only want the glob after the sudo
Sep 17 18:53:10 <llua>	yes
Sep 17 18:55:06 <tos9>	Perfect, thanks.
Sep 17 20:32:30 <Brocellous>	So when I'm using _arguments, it sets some helpful parameters for the actions, $words, $line, and $opt_args
Sep 17 20:32:58 <Brocellous>	One of my arguments has a complex completion, so I made a function for it with _regex_arguments
Sep 17 20:33:11 <Brocellous>	and I'm trying to call it from an _arguments action
Sep 17 20:33:46 <Brocellous>	It mostly works, but gets upset if there are other optargs around, refusing to match.
Sep 17 20:34:30 <Brocellous>	I'm wondering if there is a way to get my function created with _regex_arguments to 'act' only on the content of $line set by _arguments rather than the whole command w/ optargs and all.
Sep 17 20:38:00 <Brocellous>	Or another way for _arguments to strip the optargs it recognizes, basically.
Sep 17 21:21:03 <Mikachu>	Brocellous: you probably want the ml for that one
