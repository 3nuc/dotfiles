cze 21 18:39:11 <atagi>	Hey. I was wondering - everybody seems to be using apollo gql (by looking at tutorials). Is there something wrong with express-grahpql for example?

Sep 03 16:55:29 <_xor>	So, quick question/feedback...
Sep 03 16:57:18 <_xor>	I'm using an API server that has an authentication mutation which returns a JWT (token) on success.
Sep 03 16:57:38 <_xor>	The token is a base64-encoded JSON object that conforms to a specific structure.
Sep 03 16:58:24 <_xor>	Now, the schema that is returned by the API server says that the type of the value returned from that authentication mutation is a specific object type (Jwt) that's also defined there.
Sep 03 16:58:39 <_xor>	However, when executing the mutation, the returned value is that base64-encoded string.
Sep 03 16:59:23 <_xor>	My question is: Is the API server in the wrong here or does the GraphQL spec leave it open as to how the returned value is to be interpreted by the client?
Sep 03 17:00:05 <_xor>	The assumption that this API server is making is that the client(s) will automatically decode that base64-encoded string & return the Jwt object for use.
Sep 03 17:00:24 <_xor>	That seems...wrong.  The API server is returning a value that doesn't actually conform to what the schema actually says.

Sep 03 20:29:32 <r29v>	I don't think that's according to spec.
Sep 03 20:30:01 <r29v>	You shouldn't remove a field if the user is not authenticated. It should ether return an empty object or be removed from the response entirely.
Sep 03 20:30:26 <r29v>	The query shape should match the response shape
Sep 03 20:37:51 <Jemt>	Well, the API expose the same functions/fields, always. But createUser(..) won't work if you are not authorized. But specifying :User as return type would imply that I either return Null or a User - but an error is thrown if the user is unauthorized, so that wouldn't be accurate either.
Sep 03 20:38:18 <r29v>	is createUser a mutation or a query?
Sep 03 20:38:23 <Jemt>	Mutation
Sep 03 20:38:27 <r29v>	Oh
Sep 03 20:38:52 <Jemt>	I might use incorrect terms here btw. I'm new to GraphQL
Sep 03 20:38:54 <r29v>	yeah I wouldn't put the bang on it unless it's returned all the time.
Sep 03 20:39:31 <Jemt>	Okay. Thanks.
Sep 03 20:40:07 <Jemt>	Is there something like JSDoc for GraphQL schemas allow me to describe the API in more detail ?
Sep 03 20:40:32 <r29v>	https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/
