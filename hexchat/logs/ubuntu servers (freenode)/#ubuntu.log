Aug 31 11:23:34 <uio>	SwedeMike, Thanks. I see sda5_crypt
Aug 31 11:23:52 <uio>	But sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5_crypt gives nothing.
Aug 31 11:24:15 <uio>	SwedeMike, Well, "Le périphérique /dev/sda5_crypt n'existe pas ou l'accès y est interdit." actually.
Aug 31 11:24:33 <uio>	doesn't exist or access is denied.
Aug 31 11:25:39 <tomreyn>	uio: /dev/sda5_crypt is the decrypted storage, you'll need to wok on the encrypted one
Aug 31 11:25:57 <uio>	tomreyn, Okay, how can I find it?
Aug 31 11:26:02 <uio>	in disks?
Aug 31 11:26:14 <SwedeMike>	uio: what does the cryptsetup line say?
Aug 31 11:26:19 <SwedeMike>	that mentions sda5_crypt?
Aug 31 11:26:24 <uio>	doesn't exist or access is denied.
Aug 31 11:26:27 <tomreyn>	uio: if you found sda5_crypt in crypttab, then you'll also find the encrypted one on the same line
Aug 31 11:27:00 <SwedeMike>	uio: "sudo grep sda5 /etc/crypttab" and paste the output
Aug 31 11:27:22 <tomreyn>	chances are it's /dev/sda5
Aug 31 11:27:32 <SwedeMike>	better to know for sure.
Aug 31 11:27:41 <uio>	Is this info sensitive?
Aug 31 11:27:57 <uio>	Big long line of numbers and letters...
Aug 31 11:28:02 <uio>	That one?
Aug 31 11:28:10 <tomreyn>	a UUID?
Aug 31 11:28:10 <SwedeMike>	uio: if it says "UUID=" and numbers then it's not sensitive
Aug 31 11:28:18 <uio>	Right.
Aug 31 11:28:19 <uio>	Cool.
Aug 31 11:28:34 <uio>	sda5_crypt UUID=fcfc9a97-23d2-4134-820e-f90f54b6daae none luks,discard
Aug 31 11:29:13 <SwedeMike>	uio: "sudo blkid" and look for that uuid
Aug 31 11:29:39 <SwedeMike>	"sudo blkid | grep fcfc9a"
Aug 31 11:30:16 <tomreyn>	blkid --uuid fcfc9a97-23d2-4134-820e-f90f54b6daae
Aug 31 11:30:48 <uio>	sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5 gave output...
Aug 31 11:31:00 <uio>	Of both the keys.
Aug 31 11:31:06 <uio>	I'd like to remove key 2
Aug 31 11:31:17 <uio>	which is called slot 1
Aug 31 11:31:33 <SwedeMike>	uio: https://linux.die.net/man/8/cryptsetup luksRemoveKey
Aug 31 11:33:17 <uio>	SwedeMike, tomreyn Okay. I think we're good :)
Aug 31 11:33:22 <uio>	Thanks for your help!
Aug 31 11:34:29 <uio>	I want to reinstall on the same machine and use one of the same keys. Would this be a security issue? Ie, if someone learns the re-used key could they somehow access my old files? Should I rewrite with zeros to be safe?
Aug 31 12:24:30 <B|ack0p>	hi
Aug 31 12:26:44 <B|ack0p>	tomreyn: are you there and available?
Aug 31 12:27:01 <B|ack0p>	sorry pinging you..
Aug 31 13:28:13 <BluesKaj>	Hi folks
Aug 31 13:35:03 <tomreyn>	B|ack0p: There's no 1-on-1 support offering here. Please state the question / issue. If someone's available to help with it, they will respond.
Aug 31 13:44:35 <B|ack0p>	tomreyn: sorry
Aug 31 13:46:03 <tomreyn>	B|ack0p: no problem, i'm just explaining my POV on how we do support here.
Aug 31 13:49:04 <x000>	hi I'm looking for a solution to use my android device as a touchpad on ubuntu
Aug 31 13:49:11 <x000>	there's an app for this on windows and mac

Aug 31 13:50:45 <mouses>	x000: https://rarcher.github.io/couch-potato-server/downloads.html
Aug 31 13:50:59 <OerHeks>	bing + "android as touchpad for linux"   gives https://www.maketecheasier.com/remote-control-ubuntu-android-phone/
Aug 31 13:51:43 <OerHeks>	more suggestions https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/15-android-apps-remote-control-linux-pc/
Aug 31 13:57:27 <cluelessperson>	When I do ping   example.server    it pings the WRONG ip address

Aug 31 14:00:24 <tomreyn>	ph88: when is "then" exactly? after installing, when you reboot?
Aug 31 14:00:58 <tomreyn>	or does the live system from your installer not start up properly?
Aug 31 14:05:17 <ph88>	the live system doesn't start
Aug 31 14:05:38 <ph88>	i get to see text EDAC pnd2: Failed to register device with error -19.
Aug 31 14:05:54 <ph88>	Which i googled and should be a "normal" error when there is no ECC ram available
Aug 31 14:06:05 <ph88>	tomreyn, and then nothing ... just that text
Aug 31 14:06:15 <OerHeks>	ph88 what os is the host, and what vm software?

Aug 31 14:17:09 <Epharim>	hi!
Aug 31 14:17:24 <Epharim>	This should be an important update. https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2019-August/116875.html
Aug 31 14:18:10 <Epharim>	How long it takes usually to be in the release. My last compiling of sources was long time ago.
Aug 31 14:20:50 <lotuspsychje>	!usn | Epharim you can follow security updates here
Aug 31 14:20:50 <ubottu>	Epharim you can follow security updates here: Please see https://usn.ubuntu.com/ for information about recent Ubuntu security updates.
Aug 31 14:26:42 <ph88>	i have to go
Aug 31 14:26:45 <ph88>	bye
Aug 31 14:29:29 <Epharim>	I was thinking that I'm save with the version 2.2.36.4 but I altough save with 2.2.33.2. I hope so. CVE-2019-11500 Thanks
Aug 31 15:52:00 <cluelessperson>	hrm.  ubuntu seems to be resolving ipv6 before ipv4, so results in pulling external dns
Aug 31 15:52:08 <cluelessperson>	ingoring internal dns
Aug 31 15:54:56 <mystic>	get ignored in here too lol
Aug 31 16:13:44 <afidegnum>	hello, pls what tool do i need to create a Windows MRB bootable usb stick in ubuntu 18.04 ?
Aug 31 16:16:00 <ioria>	!woeusb
Aug 31 16:16:01 <ubottu>	Ubuntu does not have a recommended tool for preparing bootable Windows installation USBs. If you need one, consider using Microsoft's media creation tool from a Windows computer (see ##windows for support). If this is not an option, there are third-party unsupported tools like WoeUSB ( https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB , sudo snap install --edge woe-usb ) that might work.
Aug 31 16:16:27 <afidegnum>	ioria: woeusb create UEFI by default which is not supported by my system
Aug 31 16:16:39 <afidegnum>	i had ubuntu installed already i want to add windows
Aug 31 16:16:40 <ioria>	ah, didn't know that
Aug 31 16:17:28 <ioria>	nope, "Legacy/MBR-style/IBM PC compatible bootmode"
Aug 31 16:17:48 <afidegnum>	there is no option for that
Aug 31 16:23:10 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: there's woeusb snap if you want
Aug 31 16:24:07 <afidegnum>	lotuspsychje: i have woeusb installed already which create an EFI bootable, does snap offers an MBR version?
Aug 31 16:24:33 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: not sure, didnt test that myself
Aug 31 16:41:03 <afidegnum>	any insight ?
Aug 31 16:42:11 <ioria>	afidegnum, no, but you may try with the cli version
Aug 31 16:43:41 <ThothCastel>	I am running Ubuntu on a VMware Workstation VM on a laptop host machine with 16GB RAM, 1 Wireless adapter and 1 NIC of 1GB speed, the VM is picking up only 10MB speed for the connection when my host laptop is connected via WIFI - although my VM says it is 'wired' and I don't see my wireless adapter in my VM - why not? and why getting this limited speed? Network adapter is 'Natted'
Aug 31 16:44:00 <ioria>	afidegnum,  sudo woeusb --target-filesystem NTFS --device ~/Downloads/Win10.iso  /dev/sdX
Aug 31 16:44:38 <afidegnum>	ok, let me try
Aug 31 17:03:10 <Surfer2011>	^hello, is there anything needed to be taken care of using rsync in rsnapshot with ntfs drives?
Aug 31 17:03:14 <Surfer2011>	i get this error:  ERROR: Warning! /bin/rm failed.
Aug 31 17:04:21 <lotuspsychje>	Surfer2011: you received suggestions yesterday, did any of those help?
Aug 31 17:05:05 <Surfer2011>	how can i check as what user the rsnapshot will be started?
Aug 31 17:07:24 <Surfer2011>	30 3          * * *           root    /usr/bin/rsnapshot daily is how it is started
Aug 31 17:08:08 <Surfer2011>	/dev/disk/by-label/LaCie /srv/dev-disk-by-label-LaCie ntfs defaults,nofail 0 2            is the fstab entry
Aug 31 17:21:15 <EriC^>	Surfer2011: where is that cron line in
Aug 31 17:21:44 <Surfer2011>	/etc/cron.d/rsnapshot
Aug 31 17:27:17 <geirha>	sixth field is the user it runs as. root in this case
Aug 31 17:31:13 <geirha>	Surfer2011: what does this output?   mount | grep LaCie
Aug 31 17:31:42 <Surfer2011>	/dev/sdd1 on /srv/dev-disk-by-label-LaCie type fuseblk (rw,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096)
Aug 31 17:31:42 <Surfer2011>	/dev/sdd1 on /sharedfolders/0_LaCie type fuseblk (rw,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,allow_other,blksize=4096)
Aug 31 17:31:46 <x000>	I have the coolest nick ever
Aug 31 17:33:07 <geirha>	it's mounted read-write and with root as owner on the files, so it should be able to remove files on it
Aug 31 17:33:13 <lotuspsychje>	x000: only ubuntu issues here please
Aug 31 17:34:43 <x000>	lotuspsychje, yes of course
Aug 31 17:44:58 <Surfer2011>	any other ideas geirha
Aug 31 17:46:31 <ioria>	Surfer2011, some here suggested a fs check : https://github.com/rsnapshot/rsnapshot/issues/195
Aug 31 18:16:51 <Surfer2011>	ioria: any chance it is because of the ntfs format / mount?
Aug 31 18:18:22 <Surfer2011>	ioria: how do i do the fsck.ext4 -f /dev/ ? ... do i need to unmount it?
Aug 31 18:21:25 <Surfer2011>	and would it make any difference to mount it as ntfs-3g ???
Aug 31 18:24:41 <MoPac>	Hi, sorry, having a massive brain lapse -- what is the standard format for placing an 'override' config file containing some select text that should take priority over what is in the main file? If I want to override some options in /folder/gtk.css, is it to make /folder/gtk.css.d , then put files names whatever I want in that with a line or two of css in them? Feels not quite right...
Aug 31 18:33:13 <Surfer2011>	ntfsfix and fsck was fine
Aug 31 18:41:31 <x000>	fsck was definitely fine
Aug 31 19:03:37 <slyrobot>	tomreyn: Any progress on the Nvidia issue ?
Aug 31 19:07:20 <kokokon>	ty sarnold snap did work
Aug 31 19:37:23 <axy>	Hello there -- how can I display a log file in real time in ubuntu?,
Aug 31 19:37:31 <axy>	maybe this is more of a general linux question - not sure
Aug 31 19:37:53 <axy>	for instance tail command to display last lines -- and I need to display the logs in real time in my access.log file for nginx
Aug 31 19:38:04 <axy>	Not sure if what I need has a specific more technical name
Aug 31 19:38:07 <axy>	:)
Aug 31 19:40:19 <molinot>	Ubuntu in 16GB RAM, Chromium, 4GB swapfile goes better than in Chrome 2GB swapfile (many tabs open both cases)
Aug 31 19:40:32 <cluelessperson>	axy     tail -f /var/log/syslog
Aug 31 19:40:39 <cluelessperson>	-f  or --follow
Aug 31 19:42:14 <axy>	cluelessperson thanks! you saved my day
Aug 31 19:42:14 <molinot>	however the last kernel version has increased the power consumption from around 17+W to 40+
Aug 31 19:52:17 <gbear14275>	Hello, where would printer log files go to if a print job keeps stopping... I
Aug 31 19:52:37 <gbear14275>	I'm battling a printer setup and my latest problem is every job get's "Stopped"
Aug 31 19:55:03 <ph88>	hello. i try to install Lubuntu but the live CD is not continueing to start in the synology VM .. what can i do ??
Aug 31 20:14:47 <Netmage>	Hi, I would like to spindown the hdd after 3 minutes. I already added the recommended lines to hdparm.conf. Unfortunately nothing happen after 3 Minutes. If I use the hdparm -y /dev/sdb the hdd spindown. Is it necessary to activate (in some ways) hdparm ?
Aug 31 21:12:17 <zetheroo>	about a year ago I made this bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gthumb/+bug/1799084 but there hasn't been a single comment to date. What's the next steps?
Aug 31 21:12:18 <ubottu>	Launchpad bug 1799084 in gthumb (Ubuntu) "Gthumb Memory Leak" [Undecided,New]
Aug 31 21:13:48 <Sven_vB>	zetheroo, one option could be to bribe the maintainer to make them care. ;)
Aug 31 21:13:58 <zetheroo>	:D
Aug 31 21:13:59 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: did you file this bug yourself?
Aug 31 21:14:05 <zetheroo>	yes
Aug 31 21:14:21 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: when you file bugs to ubuntu, its reccomended to use ubuntu-bug
Aug 31 21:15:43 <Sven_vB>	there once was a Ubiquity bug that made it crash due to memory exhaustion. several people had that problem. I published a patch for it. afaik it never got mainlined, so I had to maintain my patcher for 3 generations of ubuntu just to be able to install it. then some day I switched to another installer so I don't need to cope with Ubiquity anymore.
Aug 31 21:17:00 <lotuspsychje>	Sven_vB: thats why we created the #ubuntu-discuss bug team, to create a greater audience to affect bugs
Aug 31 21:17:18 <Sven_vB>	(the patch itself stayed the same btw. I just wrote an automatic patcher because I guessed I'll need it.)
Aug 31 21:17:27 <zetheroo>	sorry, got disconnected .. what did I miss?
Aug 31 21:17:34 <Soo_Slow>	somebody once told me the world is gonna ruin me
Aug 31 21:17:55 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: did you try apport-collect BUGid ?
Aug 31 21:17:58 <Sven_vB>	Soo_Slow, I'll be happy to help with that. :)
Aug 31 21:18:30 <Soo_Slow>	:(
Aug 31 21:19:07 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: a few other tricks to get attention to your bug is, find other affected users
Aug 31 21:19:27 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: and do some tests yourself, and keep your bug updated, alive
Aug 31 21:19:39 <zetheroo>	 lotuspsychje: I cannot recall now how I reported this issue back then
Aug 31 21:20:09 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: by launchpad manual, cause no system info shows in your bug
Aug 31 21:20:36 <zetheroo>	 lotuspsychje: nothing has changed since I opened the bug report. Still the same issue. I'm really surprised more people don't experience this as well.
Aug 31 21:21:05 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: you need to give a little hand to bugs, try things
Aug 31 21:21:45 <Sven_vB>	zetheroo, especially with the memory exhaustion type bugs, a lot of power users just don't experience them because they use insane amounts of RAM on all their notebooks.
Aug 31 21:21:58 <zetheroo>	 lotuspsychje: thing is, I don't really know where to start with this.
Aug 31 21:22:41 <zetheroo>	Sven_vB: I had 16GB of memory on my last laptop and it was used right up
Aug 31 21:23:15 <Sven_vB>	zetheroo, "used" is usual in linux, it doesn't imply it's unavailable.
Aug 31 21:23:34 <Sven_vB>	zetheroo, lots of caches are kept around until something more important needs their space.
Aug 31 21:24:02 <zetheroo>	used up .. meaning ... swap was also being used up ... laptop freezing up ... can't do anything until gthumb crashes
Aug 31 21:25:24 <Sven_vB>	uplink comment #15 looks like it was fixed in version 3.5.2. you could report those good news to launchpad in case the maintainer there is waiting for upstream to fix it.
Aug 31 21:25:41 <Sven_vB>	err, upstream
Aug 31 21:25:46 <Sven_vB>	not uplink
Aug 31 21:26:26 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: a start would be: apport-collect 1799084
Aug 31 21:27:06 <zetheroo>	lotuspsychje: I don't know what that is :(
Aug 31 21:27:11 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: also, does this bug still happen on your updated system 18.04.3?
Aug 31 21:27:28 <zetheroo>	yes
Aug 31 21:27:29 <Sven_vB>	zetheroo, have you considered mitigating the impact with ulimit until it's fixed? that way only the image viewer should crash instead of a system freeze.
Aug 31 21:27:55 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: apport collect gathers your system info & logs into your bug, they are needed for the devs to debug better
Aug 31 21:28:07 <zetheroo>	ok
Aug 31 21:28:57 <Sven_vB>	zetheroo, also a good idea would be to try and check the updated upstream package. if it's fixed there, the debug info is redundant.
Aug 31 21:29:11 <Sven_vB>	the maintainers would just need to merge the fix.
Aug 31 21:29:29 <lotuspsychje>	good idea Sven_vB
Aug 31 21:30:27 <lotuspsychje>	!info gthumb disco

Aug 31 21:32:28 <zetheroo>	ok well I did the apport-collect 1799084 thingy
Aug 31 21:33:17 <lotuspsychje>	zetheroo: i dont see it in your bug yet
Aug 31 21:35:21 <zetheroo>	I did it again now
Aug 31 21:36:48 <zetheroo>	it collects the info and then shows it to me and I click 'Send'
Aug 31 21:40:41 <ioria>	zetheroo, that memory leak seems to be a common issue; have you tried the latest upstream ver or downgrade it ?
Aug 31 21:42:30 <zetheroo>	ioria: how do I try a newer version?
Aug 31 21:42:32 <devslash2>	i just did a fresh install of ubuntu and any sites that uses drm like spotify.com or songsterr.com or yahoo news videos which all use drm do not work
Aug 31 21:43:11 <Sven_vB>	DRM never works anyway. ;)
Aug 31 21:43:22 <ioria>	zetheroo, http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/sources/gthumb/3.8/   (if you know how to )
Aug 31 21:43:29 <devslash2>	i used to be able to listen to spotify
Aug 31 21:43:33 <devslash2>	in ubuntu
Aug 31 21:43:42 <devslash2>	until i reinstalled ubuntu\
Aug 31 21:44:13 <zetheroo>	ioria: so this would be something I would have to compile myself I suppose
Aug 31 21:44:21 <Bashing-om>	devslash2: "ubuntu-restricted-extras" installed ? as maybe the sites require non-free codeces ?
Aug 31 21:44:27 <Sven_vB>	are you sure you have the required licenses etc.? maybe your new Ubuntu install just looks like a new device, in which case the malfunction might be the exact purpose of DRM.
Aug 31 21:44:31 <devslash2>	does anyone know why DRM doesnt work at all
Aug 31 21:44:35 <ioria>	zetheroo, kinda : https://askubuntu.com/questions/789400/how-to-downgrade-gthumb-in-16-04
Aug 31 21:44:38 <devslash2>	how do i check
Aug 31 21:45:36 <Bashing-om>	devslash2: ' dpkg -l ubuntu-restricted-extras ' .
Aug 31 21:46:24 <devslash2>	that was it thanks
Aug 31 21:46:58 <zetheroo>	ioria: I am using the version shipped with 18.04, an LTS release of Ubuntu, and I don't really see downgrading as a 'solution'. It's just surprising that something with such a noticeable bug gets into an LTS and doesn't get fixed. :/
Aug 31 21:47:13 <ioria>	ok
Aug 31 21:47:27 <zetheroo>	ioria: but thanks for your help anyhow ;)

Sep 11 16:34:46 <bane>	that's a great idea
Sep 11 16:34:51 <bane>	i'll try that as well
Sep 11 16:35:39 <pragmaticenigma>	logikos: Apache should never run as root
Sep 11 16:36:14 <pragmaticenigma>	logikos: Also, questions regarding containers should be sent to forums dedicated to the container program that you are using. I.E. Docker based instances should be directed at the Docker community
Sep 11 16:39:46 <mgedmin>	logikos: for running inside docker?  I think you need to change APACHE_RUN_USER/APACHE_RUN_GROUP in /etc/apache2/envvars
Sep 11 16:39:48 <logikos>	pragmaticenigma: i understand, and I'm asking in several different channels as there are several different services involved
Sep 11 16:40:02 <mgedmin>	assuming your docker container is based on ubuntu (or debian)
Sep 11 16:42:49 <pragmaticenigma>	logikos: Please don't cross post... Anything to do with a docker container should be directed towards the developer of the docker container or the docker community. The setup of apache within the docker container will not match the documentation that UBuntu provides for it's packaging of Apache, volunteers here may not provide you with the most accurate information.
Sep 11 16:46:28 <logikos>	pragmaticenigma: I was posting in #docker until this issue, which seemed to be distro specific so I came here, relax man
Sep 11 16:46:36 <zamba>	are there any fundamental differences between ubuntu minimal and ubuntu desktop?
Sep 11 16:46:46 <iffraff>	I have found an app called devilspie which I think can help me with my window placement.  Has anybody any experience with this?
Sep 11 16:46:51 <zamba>	meaning: can you install packages on ubuntu minimal to get it up to a standard ubuntu desktop?
Sep 11 16:46:58 <logikos>	the ppl in #docker told me to ask here lol
Sep 11 16:47:01 <Habbie>	zamba, yes, you can
Sep 11 16:47:49 <zamba>	Habbie: is the kernel different?
Sep 11 16:47:59 <lotuspsychje>	logikos: we handle ubuntu issues here
Sep 11 16:48:18 <Habbie>	zamba, oh, i'm not sure if there are different default kernels for the two, but all kernels are available in apt-get
Sep 11 16:52:39 <doug16k>	bane, genisoimage is the almost identical to mkisofs, and exists in the ubuntu package manager
Sep 11 16:53:12 <doug16k>	so identical they are practically interchangeable
Sep 11 16:55:53 <Habbie>	ah, nice
Sep 11 16:58:30 <bane>	gotcha
Sep 11 16:58:31 <bane>	thanks guys
Sep 11 17:13:32 <iffraff>	Hi, when I boot my machine I get a grub window that give me 3 options, something like boot normally,  boot in rescue, and somethign else.  standard sutff. However, if have a usb-a device plugged into the computer that screen freezes.  is this something someone can help me with ?
Sep 11 17:14:59 <mgedmin>	apt has a nice progress bar
Sep 11 17:15:07 <mgedmin>	so why doesn't do-release-upgrade enable it???
Sep 11 17:15:42 <lotuspsychje>	!discuss | mgedmin
Sep 11 17:15:42 <ubottu>	mgedmin: Want to talk about Ubuntu, but don't have a support question? /join #ubuntu-discuss for non-support Ubuntu discussion, or try #ubuntu-offtopic for general chat. Thanks!
Sep 11 17:17:47 <pragmaticenigma>	iffraff: It is best not to boot a machine with removable storage devices attached, unless you're intending to boot from that device
Sep 11 17:19:19 <tomreyn>	iffraff: or you can reconfigure your bios not to boot off the usb
Sep 11 17:19:23 <mgedmin>	iffraff: it sounds like a bios problem; have you checked the bios setup for boot device priority settings?
Sep 11 17:19:48 <mgedmin>	I've a similar problem where my home "server" fails to boot (doesn't even get to the grub menu) if the external usb hdd is plugged in
Sep 11 17:20:12 <mgedmin>	unfortunately it seems to be a bios bug because no amount of boot device selection settings fixes it
Sep 11 17:20:31 <mgedmin>	no unattended-upgrade reboots for me
Sep 11 17:20:51 <lordcirth_>	It's surprising how often BIOS has bugs.
Sep 11 17:21:22 <iffraff>	Hi, well, it's not a storage device actually, it's any device, I have a hub with some peripherals on it, no storage though.  I feel like I checked bios but I'll check again
Sep 11 17:21:52 <leftyfb>	iffraff: tried one of the peripherals without the hub?
Sep 11 17:27:22 <iffraff>	leftyfb: yes actually I have, I think it was the logitech wireless mouse thing.  same result
Sep 11 17:27:49 <zamba>	i'm experiencing extreme stuttering on my ubuntu installation
Sep 11 17:27:56 <zamba>	it seems like there's a "pulse" every second or so
Sep 11 17:27:58 <lordcirth_>	iffraff, have you looked for bios updates from the manufacturer?
Sep 11 17:28:10 <lordcirth_>	zamba, What Ubuntu version? What graphics card and driver?
Sep 11 17:29:58 <B|ack0p>	hi. can i install Ubuntu 18.04 - 64bit inside SD card?
Sep 11 17:31:56 <lordcirth_>	B|ack0p, yes, but it will be quite slow
Sep 11 17:31:59 <SirScott>	trying to create a python virtualenv on a live 19.04 desktop.  apt install python3-venv --> Package python3-venv is not available, but is referred to by another package.  Yes, i have done 'apt update'.  What am I missing?
Sep 11 17:32:15 <B|ack0p>	lordcirth_: thx..
Sep 11 17:32:24 <zamba>	lordcirth_: i'm working on that, give me a second
Sep 11 17:32:25 <B|ack0p>	so sd cards still slow..
Sep 11 17:32:37 <iffraff>	lordcirth_: I have never done a bios update.  frankly scares the crap out of me.  how do you do that?
Sep 11 17:32:55 <frib>	is anyone able to help me troubleshoot my audio? I really need it and I have no idea what to do.. The ONLY audio I have is those pops you hear when you change the volume. (Strange) It used to be ONLY the speaker test that I could hear (Even stranger). What is going on?! Thanks
Sep 11 17:33:01 <pragmaticenigma>	B|ack0p: You could, but it wouldn't perform very well. It would be the same process as making a USB drive. The computer's BIOS/Firmware does need to support booting from SD cards too
Sep 11 17:33:39 <lordcirth_>	iffraff, firstly, only do it if the manufacturer's update says that it fixes your issue. Secondly, follow the instructions on the manufacturer's page, if they have Linux (or generic) instructions.
Sep 11 17:34:08 <iffraff>	k, but I think I'll use this as a last resort.
Sep 11 17:34:18 <mgedmin>	SirScott: did you run sudo apt update?
Sep 11 17:34:38 <mgedmin>	iirc you need to do that before apt install anything-at-all will start working in a live session
Sep 11 17:34:45 <B|ack0p>	pragmaticenigma: well i tried once i couldnt install inside SD card. if it will be very slow then no need to try again.. i was considering to extend my actual space
Sep 11 17:35:23 <iffraff>	has anyone used devilspie for window placement? ( i have two issues :) )
Sep 11 17:37:46 <SirScott>	mgedmin: yes
Sep 11 17:38:48 <mgedmin>	and apt install python3-venv still fails?  weird; what apt mirrors are you using?
Sep 11 17:40:05 <SirScott>	mgedmin: https://bpaste.net/show/R38k
Sep 11 17:40:34 <pragmaticenigma>	!patience | frib
Sep 11 17:40:34 <ubottu>	frib: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or https://ubuntuforums.org or https://askubuntu.com/
Sep 11 17:41:04 <pragmaticenigma>	SirScott: try "apt install python3-defaults"
Sep 11 17:41:23 <frib>	pragmaticenigma, you mean from when I asked the other day?
Sep 11 17:41:35 <mgedmin>	SirScott: most likely /etc/apt/sources.list only enables the 'main' component; python3-venv is from universe
Sep 11 17:41:56 <pragmaticenigma>	frib: Sorry... I was scrolled up and thought you had repeated
Sep 11 17:42:15 <frib>	pragmaticenigma, no, but no problem
Sep 11 17:44:43 <SirScott>	mgedmin: mgedmin: success, thanks a lot!

Sep 12 10:22:51 <gst568923>	Hi guys, in ubuntu 19.04, synaptic show me that the packages "libsnmp30" and "libsnmp-base" are "Installed (local and obsolete)" but if remove it, there are other dependencies: colord, libsane ...
Sep 12 10:31:22 <lotuspsychje>	gst568923: best to pastebin the full apt output, so volunteers can think along with you
Sep 12 10:33:40 <gst568923>	lotuspsychje I have used frontend Synaptic, what is the corresponding command cli?
Sep 12 10:34:25 <MJCDawy>	"frontend synaptic"
Sep 12 10:34:34 <MJCDawy>	apt ?
Sep 12 10:34:38 <lotuspsychje>	gst568923: wich packages are you trying to install/purge?
Sep 12 10:35:53 <MJCDawy>	does it matter
Sep 12 10:38:45 <gst568923>	lotuspsychje in the previous days I normally opened synaptic and I clicked on the update button, to update other packages and I found that the "libsnmp30" and "libsnmp-base" packages that from the "installed" item are automatically passed to the "installed (local or obsolete)"
Sep 12 10:40:10 <tomreyn>	gst568923: can you run and post this to get us started? it returns some general info on your apt repository configuration and package management system, without actually changing anything:   sudo /bin/true && cat &>/tmp/aptlog < <(sudo apt-get -qqy update 2>&1; apt-cache policy 2>&1; sudo apt-get -syV full-upgrade 2>&1;); nc termbin.com 9999 </tmp/aptlog; rm /tmp/aptlog
Sep 12 10:40:44 <lotuspsychje>	MJCDawy: yes, details matter
Sep 12 10:43:13 <tomreyn>	gst568923: if you however dislike the idea of running those commands which you may not know/understand, you could also just show some synaptic screenshots, like form the detail view of when it updates package lists, and the screeen where it discusses that those packages are obsolete, and the screen where it wants to remove those other packages.
Sep 12 10:43:16 <MJCDawy>	lotuspsychje, hello I want to manage a package. what is the thing like synaptic for the cli
Sep 12 10:43:28 <MJCDawy>	what details would matter in this inquiry
Sep 12 10:43:52 <lotuspsychje>	MJCDawy: feel free to come discuss this in #ubuntu-discuss
Sep 12 10:44:51 <MJCDawy>	I'm already too deep inside the ubuntu beast I fear, lest I risk partial digestion

Sep 12 10:48:01 <BWestOz>	Can anyone suggest a command line tool I can use to monitor CPU use in real time?
Sep 12 10:48:05 <magic_ninja>	anyone know if there is an official channel for the ubuntu graphics ppa?
Sep 12 10:48:15 <lotuspsychje>	nvidia | magic_ninja
Sep 12 10:48:19 <lotuspsychje>	!nvidia
Sep 12 10:48:20 <ubottu>	For nvidia and matrox graphics cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto . For AMD/ATI graphics cards, see « /msg ubottu ati » and « /msg ubottu fglrxmissing » For the latest Nvidia drivers see https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
Sep 12 10:49:03 <doug16k>	magic_ninja, atop will give a lot of details. top is the simple version of that and is probably already installed
Sep 12 10:49:26 <tomreyn>	gst568923: hmm my italian is not very good, i'm afraid.
Sep 12 10:49:31 <magic_ninja>	I want to speak with the maintainers of the ppa
Sep 12 10:49:50 <doug16k>	qtop is very much like windows task manager
Sep 12 10:49:56 <lotuspsychje>	magic_ninja: contact the maintainer on the ppa..
Sep 12 10:50:15 <magic_ninja>	full circle now, anyone know if the ppa has its own irc channel?
Sep 12 10:51:09 <gst568923>	tomreyn "I seguenti pacchetti sono stati aggiornati:" translated in english "The following packages have been updated:"
Sep 12 10:51:29 <doug16k>	oops, not you magic_ninja. I meant BWestOz
Sep 12 10:51:46 <tomreyn>	BWestOz: realtime wont be possible since any application will need to receive, process and output the information. top can do it fast enough usually.
Sep 12 10:51:51 <doug16k>	BWestOz, top or atop
Sep 12 10:52:12 <gst568923>	tomreyn "I seguenti pacchetti sono stati installati:" translated "The following packages have been installed:"
Sep 12 10:52:16 <lotuspsychje>	!alis | magic_ninja to find a channel
Sep 12 10:52:16 <ubottu>	magic_ninja to find a channel: Alis is an IRC service to help you find channels. For help on using it, see "/msg Alis help list" or ask in #freenode. Example usage: "/msg Alis list http"
Sep 12 10:52:52 <magic_ninja>	thats fine. appreciate it. I just figured someone in here might know of it off the top of their head
Sep 12 10:53:03 <tomreyn>	gst568923: thanks. so none of this suggests that these packages you mentioned are obsolete, just that they are about to be upgraded
Sep 12 10:53:05 <doug16k>	BWestOz, atop will give you extensive information, and per-cpu information. top is a summary
Sep 12 10:53:58 <doug16k>	BWestOz, htop is good if atop is too much information
Sep 12 10:54:44 <BWestOz>	I'm just having a look with top at the moment. Thank you all very much
Sep 12 10:54:56 <gst568923>	tomreyn I know it sounds strange but they are shown in that entry after I updated the day "Commit Log for Fri Sep 6 13:05:45 2019"
Sep 12 10:56:02 <BWestOz>	It's quite fun clicking away on my browser and watching top. Not very scientific though!
Sep 12 10:57:25 <gst568923>	furthermore clicking with the right button, the reinstallation entry is disabled, the only items that can be activated on synaptic are "remove" or "remove completely"
Sep 12 10:59:42 <gst568923>	tomreyn maybe I found the problem
Sep 12 11:01:54 <BWestOz>	Thank you all for your helpful suggestions.
Sep 12 11:03:39 <gst568923>	my installed version is "5.7.3 + dfsg-5ubuntu1.1" but by clicking on synaptic on "force version" the entry "5.7.3 + dfsg-5ubuntu1.1 (now)" appears. Maybe I should downgrade to "5.7.3 + dfsg-5ubuntu1 (disco)"
Sep 12 11:03:48 <gst568923>	tomreyn
Sep 12 11:05:56 <tomreyn>	!info libsnmp30 disco
Sep 12 11:05:59 <ubottu>	libsnmp30 (source: net-snmp): SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) library. In component main, is optional. Version 5.7.3+dfsg-5ubuntu1 (disco), package size 922 kB, installed size 3907 kB
Sep 12 11:07:41 <tomreyn>	gst568923: this suggests the latest version of libsnmp30 in 19.04 "disco" is 5.7.3+dfsg-5ubuntu1. but this information can be out of date, which your system seeing 5.7.3+dfsg-5ubuntu1.1 seems to suggest
Sep 12 11:08:06 <tomreyn>	so maybe you've just hit the middle of a mirror update, and should just reload the packages list.
Sep 12 11:08:27 <tomreyn>	i.e. refresh the repository cache.
Sep 12 11:12:24 <gst568923>	tomreyn I downgraded and works :-)  probably version 1.1 was not referred to ubuntu disco but to (now) that I didn't understand what it means
Sep 12 11:14:58 <tomreyn>	just dont hold it on this downgraded version and you should be fine.
Sep 12 11:16:08 <gst568923>	tomreyn the word "now" to which version of ubuntu refers?
Sep 12 11:17:43 <tomreyn>	to the UBUNTU_CODENAME in /etc/os-release
Sep 12 11:18:06 <tomreyn>	though i'm not 100% certain on this
Sep 12 11:18:54 <gst568923>	tomreyn what about the repository server even if I am in Italy which servers are more reliable "http://archive.ubuntu.com" or "http://it.archive.ubuntu.com"? What do you suggest me?
Sep 12 11:21:40 <tomreyn>	gst568923: the latter is usually fine.
Sep 12 11:21:43 <tomreyn>	!mirrors
Sep 12 11:21:43 <ubottu>	Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors - PLEASE use the !torrents to download !Disco, and help keeping the servers' load low!
Sep 12 11:22:17 <tomreyn>	actually ignore what ubottus told you there and look at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors
Sep 12 11:23:29 <tomreyn>	it.archive.ubuntu.com is an alias for ubuntu.mirror.garr.it.
Sep 12 11:24:10 <tomreyn>	...but this can change, so it's best to keep using it.archive.ubuntu.com
Sep 12 11:25:51 <gst568923>	tomreyn how did you find the corresponding alias?
Sep 12 11:28:24 <tomreyn>	gst568923: using the "host" command on a terminal. "dig" or "systemd-resolve" would work, too.
Sep 12 11:29:46 <gst568923>	tomreyn yes, `dig it.archive.ubuntu.com` works
Sep 12 11:30:54 <gst568923>	tomreyn `dig archive.ubuntu.com` return me 91.189.88.XXX varius number
Sep 12 11:44:45 <tomreyn>	yes, DNS can be exciting.
Sep 12 11:47:24 <adac>	For 16.04, which apt package holds the virt-rescue binary?

Sep 12 13:34:58 <tomreyn>	Dirkos: actually this seems to have also broken "apt update" with only http urls according to bug 1843507 (which has since been fixed).

Sep 12 13:35:46 <Dirkos>	ok thanks!
Sep 12 13:40:24 <Reventlov>	Hey.
Sep 12 13:41:06 <Reventlov>	When trying to install ubuntu, I'm greeted with a "EFI Stub: UEFI Secure Boot is enabled" and then nothing else, on a black screen
Sep 12 13:41:16 <Reventlov>	I tried various options, nomodeset, and so on, and nothing seems to work
Sep 12 13:42:06 <tomreyn>	Reventlov: try disabling uefi secure boot in the bios for now. you can re-enable it later if needed.
Sep 12 13:42:33 <Reventlov>	I also get a black screen, without the message
Sep 12 13:43:05 <Reventlov>	intel core i7, 8th gen, with intel hd graphics
Sep 12 13:43:05 <EoflaOE>	Reventlov: What about removing quiet to see which message it stuck on?
Sep 12 13:43:42 <tomreyn>	!bootlog
Sep 12 13:43:42 <ubottu>	To get a more verbose log of the boot process, add the following !kernelparm: debug systemd.log_level=info
Sep 12 13:45:11 <Reventlov>	so, without quiet, and with debug systemd.log_level=info: black screen
Sep 12 13:45:24 <Reventlov>	(and without secure boot)
Sep 12 13:45:30 <Reventlov>	(I boot in UEFI mode)
Sep 12 13:46:29 <tomreyn>	are you able to boot to recovery?
Sep 12 13:46:38 <Reventlov>	the ubuntu is not installed yet
Sep 12 13:46:44 <Reventlov>	how can I boot to recovery
Sep 12 13:47:00 <tomreyn>	ah, sorry, i missed that it's not installed, yet
Sep 12 13:47:23 <tomreyn>	remove "splash" also, add "nosplash"
Sep 12 13:47:41 <tomreyn>	which hardware is this?
Sep 12 13:48:04 <Reventlov>	some asus UX331F Notebook
Sep 12 13:48:05 <Ool>	Reventlov: secure boot block you to boot with an other device, you need to put it off to install
Sep 12 13:48:06 <Reventlov>	black screen.
Sep 12 13:48:16 <Reventlov>	Ool: secure boot is disabled now.
Sep 12 13:48:20 <Reventlov>	same problem.
Sep 12 13:48:28 <Reventlov>	(without the message, still)
Sep 12 13:48:53 <Ool>	to install in EFI mode you need to boot in EFI mode too (not legacy)
Sep 12 13:49:00 <Reventlov>	which is what I do.
Sep 12 13:49:05 <tomreyn>	this is maybe bug 1829620
Sep 12 13:49:06 <ubottu>	bug 1829620 in linux-hwe-edge (Ubuntu) "intel-microcode on ASUS makes kernel stuck during loading initramfs on bionic-updates, bionic-security" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1829620
Sep 12 13:50:09 <leftyfb>	Reventlov: which version of ubuntu are you trying to install?
Sep 12 13:50:37 <Reventlov>	18.04, I'll try to update the bios (I currently have version 2.20.1271)
Sep 12 13:51:15 <tomreyn>	Reventlov: bios upgrade may help (and is probably a good idea), another workaround is to boot with dis_ucode_ldr
Sep 12 13:53:56 <linuxconformer>	why is my systemd service not updating? it keeps throwing an error from on old version, i've run daemon-reload and restarted the service, but it's still reading an old versoin
Sep 12 13:55:27 <tomreyn>	systemd is the init process, to restart it you'll need to reboot.
Sep 12 13:55:40 <tomreyn>	(or kexec)
Sep 12 13:58:00 <tomreyn>	it's not really safe to just upgrade systemd within an ubuntu release, though, unless you know exactly what the implications are and are able to handle those.
Sep 12 13:58:30 <linuxconformer>	thanks
Sep 12 13:58:36 <tomreyn>	(other than bug fix / security updates, which won't change the version number systemd reports)
Sep 12 13:59:01 <Reventlov>	dis_ucode_ldr made it
Sep 12 13:59:19 <tomreyn>	Reventlov: and a bios upgrade did not?

Sep 12 14:22:37 <BluesKaj>	Howdy all
Sep 12 14:23:20 <tomreyn>	grammoboy2: so you probably have a lot of subdirectories or files in a single directory somewhere - try to remove some, or to change the structure.
Sep 12 14:24:20 <grammoboy2>	tomreyn, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RemoveOldKernels trying
Sep 12 14:25:37 <tomreyn>	this helps with low disk space, not so much with few free inodes, though somewhat, too.
Sep 12 14:27:02 <tomreyn>	MindSpark: review the system log then to get a better idea of what went wrong when the system was booting.
Sep 12 14:28:16 <Pr070cal>	hi guys
Sep 12 14:28:27 <Pr070cal>	just reinstalled 19.04
Sep 12 14:28:58 <Pr070cal>	with separate partitions for /opt /usr /var and all the directories
Sep 12 14:29:01 <tomreyn>	MindSpark: also ensure the system is full yupdated, since there were some systemd related bugs in the past which could trigger this situation (which have since been fixed)
Sep 12 14:29:32 <Pr070cal>	if i install a new version of ubuntu will the applications still be in those partitions and startup ?
Sep 12 14:29:39 <leftyfb>	Pr070cal: you know that really isn't necessary
Sep 12 14:30:06 <leftyfb>	Pr070cal: the files will be there, but it will probably not function the way you think. That's not the right way to do it
Sep 12 14:30:21 <Pr070cal>	i want to install and configure things like snort that make / changes
Sep 12 14:30:28 <Pr070cal>	how should i do it
Sep 12 14:30:53 <Pr070cal>	someone said bindmount and someone else said install live persistance to hdd from usb
Sep 12 14:31:17 <leftyfb>	Pr070cal: can you explain in detail what you're trying to accomplish?
Sep 12 14:31:51 <Pr070cal>	so i install and configure snort then when i install new version of ubuntu it looks at /etc partition and loads those files instead of the ones at / and snort runs
Sep 12 14:32:13 <Pr070cal>	and is still there if i wipe /
Sep 12 14:32:41 <Pr070cal>	it works with persistance on usb it uses files on /persistance instead of /
Sep 12 14:33:02 <leftyfb>	Pr070cal: you probably want something like overlayroot. But still, I don't think things are going to work out the way you think. It's really a lot easier and quicker to just keep backups and restore after a new install.
Sep 12 14:34:21 <tomreyn>	i think file system / block device snapshotting was also mentioned previously
Sep 12 14:34:31 <Pr070cal>	anyone use bindmount ?
Sep 12 14:34:33 <leftyfb>	tomreyn: even worse
Sep 12 14:35:03 <Pr070cal>	how about make a persistance partition ?
Sep 12 14:35:14 <tomreyn>	leftyfb: no idea, i haven't tried it for this use case.
Sep 12 14:37:48 <Pr070cal>	overlayroot looks cool
Sep 12 14:38:52 <Pr070cal>	founs this in casper-rw /etc/fstab
Sep 12 14:38:53 <Pr070cal>	overlay / overlay rw 0 0
Sep 12 14:39:14 <Pr070cal>	just need a capser-rw partiton i think on hdd and /
Sep 12 14:40:00 <Pr070cal>	then wipe / reinstall and casper-rw has all the changes on root and loads them fisrt
Sep 12 14:41:47 <OerHeks>	that would .. wipe casper-rw ?
Sep 12 14:42:11 <grammoboy2>	tomreyn, thx
Sep 12 14:42:14 <Pr070cal>	no casper-rw has all your changes in
Sep 12 14:42:43 <grammoboy2>	it's updating now
Sep 12 14:42:52 <Pr070cal>	so make a change to /etc in casper partition then it wont use the version in /
Sep 12 14:43:28 <Pr070cal>	so i upgrade ubuntu in / with fresh install and when it boots i mount casper and it uses files in casper-rw first
Sep 12 14:49:52 <julius_>	hi

Sep 12 14:53:05 <julius_>	there are other packages on their two, but im not sure if i can trust the mirro
Sep 12 14:53:06 <julius_>	r
Sep 12 14:53:38 <julius_>	OerHeks is it listed somewhere on a mariadb page?
Sep 12 14:55:17 <OerHeks>	your url changes here to http://mariadb.mirror.liquidtelecom.com/repo/10.3/, a redirect..  you can check it at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mirror-sites-for-mariadb/
Sep 12 14:58:06 <julius_>	ah alright, makes it a bit more trustworthy

Sep 12 15:01:20 <lotuspsychje>	BoneE: is your driver loaded? what happens on wich player?
Sep 12 15:01:56 <BoneE>	VLC is the best i can play it on. but still a little bit of screen tearing
Sep 12 15:02:50 <lotuspsychje>	BoneE: check sudo lshw -C video to see if your graphics driver is loaded
Sep 12 15:03:58 <BoneE>	will try when i get home
Sep 12 15:04:09 <BoneE>	anything else i can try
Sep 12 15:04:34 <lotuspsychje>	BoneE: yes, compare with smplayer
Sep 12 15:06:03 <tomreyn>	grammoboy2: probably a result of the disk running full. try to do as it says. you should also reboot soon after / ran full.
Sep 12 15:43:11 <CrazyEddy>	authenticate 'disco.tar.gz' against 'disco.tar.gz.gpg' -- I get this when running do-release-upgrade .  Any clues?

Sep 12 15:50:19 <CrazyEddy>	Right, so what's going on with do-release upgrade?
Sep 12 15:50:57 <tomreyn>	you'Re running an unsupported release. there's no guarantees that upgradign from an unsupported release is possible.

Sep 12 15:54:57 <TJ->	it annoys me that d-r-u doesn't automatically handle needing to switch to old-releases to handle these cases
Sep 12 15:55:42 <leftyfb>	CrazyEddy: you have yet to post an lxd error.
Sep 12 15:56:05 <CrazyEddy>	So what can I do about the failed authentication?
Sep 12 15:56:12 <CrazyEddy>	I removed LXD.

Sep 12 16:01:16 <iffraff>	leftyfb: oh, but we know that it will be install in ubuntu and mac?
Sep 12 16:01:32 <leftyfb>	iffraff: it will be installed on ubuntu
Sep 12 16:02:01 <iffraff>	will it throw on mac?

Sep 12 16:38:13 <hays_>	how do I configure ubuntu to load ebtables at boot
Sep 12 16:42:05 <hays_>	it seems like there are a few options here... although most of the internet knows about iptables specifically..
Sep 12 16:42:23 <hays_>	I have an ebtables rule that I'd like run on startup.
Sep 12 16:43:00 <Kats99>	im just here to see someone talk about debian
Sep 12 16:43:34 <Kats99>	and imma leave now
Sep 12 16:43:50 <TJ->	hays_: ebtables package contains a systemd unit to start it, that controls an old sysvinit /etc/init.d/ebtables script, that in turn is controlled by /etc/default/ebtables
Sep 12 16:45:16 <hays_>	TJ- thanks. helpful. I see that. where do the rules go though?
Sep 12 16:46:06 <TJ->	hays_: according to /etc/init.d/ebtables they will be /etc/ebtables/$table
Sep 12 16:46:48 <TJ->	hays_: look in function save() where it does " /sbin/ebtables -t $table --atomic-file ${EBTABLES_DUMPFILE_STEM}.$table --atomic-save "
Sep 12 16:47:35 <TJ->	hays_: no, I'm wrong, it'll be /etc/ebtables.$table
Sep 12 16:47:48 <hays_>	heh ok so I can backdoor that by calling the /etc/init.d script directly
Sep 12 16:48:03 <hays_>	since systemctl save ebtables isn't a thing
Sep 12 16:48:11 <TJ->	hays_: or just "sudo systemctl start ebtables"
Sep 12 16:48:33 <TJ->	hays_: oh I see what you mean, to save your manually added rules initially

Sep 12 16:50:25 <hays_>	TJ- ick, the files are binaries
Sep 12 16:50:42 <hays_>	I wonder if that will work if I am imaging the system
Sep 12 16:51:48 <hays_>	TJ- thanks for the assistance
Sep 12 16:55:04 <TJ->	hays_: you might be able to dump the textual versions with something like "ebtables --atomic-file=/etc/ebtables.filter --list "
Sep 12 16:55:38 <hays_>	TJ- oh yeah there is ebtables-save
Sep 12 16:55:46 <hays_>	and ebtables-restore
Sep 12 16:56:23 <TJ->	aha!
Sep 12 16:56:25 <hays_>	So.. I can run that once and save the tables thru /etc/init.d/ebtables save
Sep 12 16:56:39 <hays_>	still slightly messy but will work
Sep 12 16:58:33 <lordcirth_>	sweb, anything in 'systemctl status tinc'?
Sep 12 16:58:53 <riex>	mwape!
Sep 12 16:59:13 <riex>	I love when u call me Se�orita!
Sep 12 16:59:53 <leftyfb>	riex: can we help you with something?
Sep 12 17:00:18 <riex>	i know u like the song!
Sep 12 17:01:14 <riex>	I know everything, so I dont need help. lol
Sep 12 17:01:59 <riex>	I'm calling you up to getting down, down, down :P
Sep 12 17:02:26 <OerHeks>	time to read the topic, riex, there is also #ubuntu-offtopic
Sep 12 17:02:42 <riex>	So i broke the rules lol?
Sep 12 17:02:44 <riex>	take it easy dude
Sep 12 17:02:54 <riex>	Ive been here for years.
Sep 12 17:03:30 <riex>	If you got a problem with me, just ignore me, thanks!
Sep 12 17:12:05 <SimonNL>	riex!*@* added to ignore list.
Sep 12 17:12:47 <lordcirth_>	riex, it is unreasonable to expect all 1169 people in here to have to ignore you, when you could just not spam.
Sep 12 17:16:01 <pragmaticenigma>	jerware: ntpd is not a server, it only manages the local machine. For more information look at "man ntpd" or look at https://linux.die.net/man/8/ntpd
Sep 12 17:17:12 <jerware>	pragmaticenigma: is that what's used on workstations to keep synced?
Sep 12 17:18:12 <pragmaticenigma>	jerware: It's used on nearly all machine types to keep themselves in sync with a defined timeserver.
Sep 12 17:18:25 <jerware>	ahh yes, that's what I'm looking for.  thanks.
Sep 12 17:18:46 <jerware>	so if ntpd is for that, then what is the daemon on that defined timeserver?
Sep 12 17:21:16 <Ool>	timesyncd works for time client
Sep 12 17:21:37 <jerware>	doesn't timesynd use ntpd ?
Sep 12 17:22:45 <leftyfb>	chronyd can be used as a time server between machines
Sep 12 17:23:19 <Ool>	https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html
Sep 12 18:13:30 <stoned>	Hi is it possible to make grep to exclude * but only include *.txt ?
Sep 12 18:17:10 <lordcirth_>	stoned, not sure what you mean.
Sep 12 18:17:29 <pragmaticenigma>	stoned: Might need a little information... are you asking if you can restrict grep to searching only files with a .txt extension?
Sep 12 18:21:58 <leftyfb>	stoned: grep $STRING *.txt
Sep 12 18:25:16 <stoned>	 grep -HIFnir --exclude=\*.{sql,html,js,css,tmp} --exclude-dir={.svn,tmp,uploads,menuicon,osimages,ioncube} 'STR_REGION' /var/www/project199
Sep 12 18:25:19 <stoned>	Something like that
Sep 12 18:25:35 <stoned>	Trying to only search through php files
Sep 12 18:25:41 *	Drone sets mode -j on #ubuntu
Sep 12 18:25:50 <stoned>	once I get the grep command right, I'll put that into exec in php
Sep 12 18:25:56 <stoned>	web based greppy tool for code.
Sep 12 18:25:57 <stoned>	don't ask.
Sep 12 18:26:34 <stoned>	I wonder if you can exclude pattern *
Sep 12 18:26:45 <stoned>	everything! and then include only pattern .php\
Sep 12 18:27:07 <stoned>	that way grep is faster and doesn't have to go through 3 kinds of code files
Sep 12 18:27:12 *	niven.freenode.net sets mode +j on #ubuntu 5:10
Sep 12 18:27:18 <stoned>	I can make it search through only php or only js or only css or only css
Sep 12 18:27:19 <stoned>	etc.
Sep 12 18:27:24 <stoned>	Does that make sense what I need to do?
Sep 12 18:27:58 <stoned>	 grep -HIFnir --exclude=\*.* --include=*.php --exclude-dir={.svn,tmp,uploads,menuicon,osimages,ioncube} 'STR_REGION' /var/www/project199
Sep 12 18:28:01 <stoned>	something like that maybe?
Sep 12 18:28:03 <stoned>	I don't even know.
Sep 12 18:28:11 <leftyfb>	!enter | stoned
Sep 12 18:28:12 <ubottu>	stoned: Please try and keep as much of your info as possible on ONE line - easier to follow for everyone.
Sep 12 18:28:15 <pragmaticenigma>	stoned: Instead of trying to do everything at once, do them in separate operations. Side bar, this isn't a programming channel, You really should be asking questions like this on stack exchange or other forums dedicated to software developemnt
Sep 12 18:28:20 <leftyfb>	grep *.php
Sep 12 18:28:51 <leftyfb>	grep -HIFnir 'STR_REGION' /var/www/project999
Sep 12 18:29:37 <stoned>	yes, include and exclude in that manner work.
Sep 12 18:29:43 <stoned>	I figured it's a linux thing ask in my distro channel
Sep 12 18:29:44 <stoned>	np
Sep 12 18:30:05 <stoned>	grep -HIFnir --exclude=\*.* --include=*.php  --exclude-dir={.svn,tmp,uploads,menuicon,osimages,ioncube} 'STR_REGION'
Sep 12 18:30:13 <stoned>	That's brilliant.

Sep 12 18:56:37 <pragmaticenigma>	B|ack0p: Buy a new machine
Sep 12 18:59:49 <Habbie>	B|ack0p, sometimes my audio goes bad (debian, thinkpad x1, but still) - if i then go to audio settings (in gnome, in my case) and switch the output device to another one and back, audio is good again
Sep 12 19:00:35 <B|ack0p>	Habbie: hmm
Sep 12 19:01:05 <B|ack0p>	there are 2 devices in Sound settings :
Sep 12 19:01:33 <B|ack0p>	1- Digital Output (S/PDIF) - Built in Audio
Sep 12 19:01:46 <B|ack0p>	2- Speakers - Built in Audio
Sep 12 19:01:51 <B|ack0p>	1 doesnt work
Sep 12 19:01:56 <B|ack0p>	2 works but bad sound
Sep 12 19:02:00 <Habbie>	i have 3, of which 2 come out of my speakers
Sep 12 19:02:17 <B|ack0p>	sorry your method didnt work for T60
Sep 12 19:02:18 <Sven_vB>	gparted takes forever trying to read /dev/sdb partitions. any ideas where I can see why?
Sep 12 19:02:40 <Habbie>	B|ack0p, too bad
Sep 12 19:02:47 <B|ack0p>	Habbie:  T60 is grand grand grand father of your X1 :p
Sep 12 19:02:49 <Habbie>	Sven_vB, what is /dev/sdb?
Sep 12 19:02:51 <Habbie>	B|ack0p, i figured :)
Sep 12 19:02:59 <B|ack0p>	well X1 is not true blood Thinkpad unfortunately :/
Sep 12 19:03:05 <Sven_vB>	Habbie, a USB thumb drive
Sep 12 19:03:45 <Sven_vB>	Habbie, I suspect my kernel is confused because I copied an image onto the device (the entire block device, no partition) while gparted was still open (idle)
Sep 12 19:04:04 <Habbie>	Sven_vB, ah, that may need some kind of kick - reopening gparted might even do it
Sep 12 19:04:20 <kinghat>	is it possible to leave a firefox extension shortcut to nothing?
Sep 12 19:04:20 <Sven_vB>	Habbie, no, I killed and re-opened gparted several times
Sep 12 19:05:32 <Sven_vB>	Habbie, I also un- and replugged the thumb drive in each attempt
Sep 12 19:06:16 <Sven_vB>	now I tried with another thumb drive, same problem. maybe a module that handles USB TDs is crashed?
Sep 12 19:06:31 <Sven_vB>	oh cool it settled
Sep 12 19:08:15 <Sven_vB>	on a side note: how can I convince nautilus's places sidebar to show me all partitions on my USB thumbdrive, even those with boot/esp flags?
Sep 12 19:09:03 <Habbie>	Sven_vB, replugging should solve any 'kernel confused' problems, so i don't know what happened there
Sep 12 19:17:36 <Sven_vB>	I'm now in fdisk and I managed to set up all partitions except the end sector of p1 is wrong. what's the easiest way to change it?
Sep 12 19:18:50 <Sven_vB>	do I need to delete that partition first? what other meta data would I need to write down except start/end and whether it has a boot flag?
Sep 12 19:22:49 <Sven_vB>	well, yolo. in the worst case I'll just restore the MBR again.
Sep 12 19:24:09 <Sven_vB>	cross-posted to #systemd: is there a kernel option to tell my Bionic live USB systemd I want to login in text mode asap and stuff like network isn't required for now?
Sep 12 19:24:54 <Sven_vB>	I use "2" for now but still lots of bloat is loaded
Sep 12 19:34:00 <roger_padactor>	where should I place my uploaded files for a website. the location would also need access from a remote windows machine to sftp files to that folder.  currently we can them as c:/file/ on windows but we are moving to ubuntu server
Sep 12 19:36:50 <OerHeks>	the webserver gets his files from /var/www/ as user www-data. so a new folder under /var/ could be logical.
Sep 12 19:38:16 <roger_padactor>	that is what we were thinking, the issue is when the windows machine sftps a pdf over that needs access through the web interface how do we automatically give is www-data permissions ?
Sep 12 19:39:09 <bviktor>	hi, how do i find out why firefox keeps failing my downloads? only in my user, but in my user it happens with a clean profile too. ubuntu 18.04
Sep 12 19:40:34 <lordcirth_>	bviktor, what happens? The download hangs? Errors?
Sep 12 19:40:48 <bviktor>	"failed"
Sep 12 19:40:52 <bviktor>	not a single byte is downloaded
Sep 12 19:41:11 <bviktor>	works fine in other browsers, works fine for other users on this same computer
Sep 12 19:42:13 <bviktor>	but in firefox, in my user, it fails no matter what
Sep 12 19:45:04 <lordcirth_>	bviktor, try using curl -v and see if anything weird shows
Sep 12 19:47:41 <bviktor>	cant see any errors, and the file downloads fine
Sep 12 19:48:46 <p0a>	Hello how can I check why my ubuntu failed to boot the last 2-3 times (then worked?)
Sep 12 20:02:56 <Sven_vB>	how do I change the font size or resolution of a text TTY?
Sep 12 20:03:19 <Sven_vB>	or text console it's called I think
Sep 12 20:03:31 <Sven_vB>	text TTY seems redundant :)
Sep 12 20:07:43 <lordcirth_>	p0a, how did it fail? What did you see?
Sep 12 20:16:22 <sweb>	lordcirth_: problem solved, it's problem for firewall. also seems be tinc is single thread i try to replace it with wireguard
Sep 12 20:16:39 <lordcirth_>	sweb, good to know
Sep 12 20:38:13 <pragmaticenigma>	Sven_vB: TTY => TeleTYpewriter
Sep 12 20:39:55 <pragmaticenigma>	Sven_vB: Also, I believe this will help configure your TTY session: sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
Sep 12 20:40:09 <pragmaticenigma>	complete instructions here: https://askubuntu.com/a/940218
Sep 12 20:40:13 <p0a>	lordcirth_: stuck on `ubuntu' loadup screen
Sep 12 20:40:55 <lordcirth_>	p0a, remove 'quiet splash' from your grub entry in /etc/default/grub. Then the next time it happens it might say why.
Sep 12 20:41:02 <lordcirth_>	(and run update-grub)

Sep 16 00:47:20 <OerHeks>	no , i am not sure your upgrade would give a working system.

Sep 16 00:48:53 <OerHeks>	some sources/ppa's will not survive upgrading, those are propperly disabled.

Sep 16 11:04:25 <bayman>	Fabric or Ansible
Sep 16 11:06:06 <ZaZaGX>	do i need to use Windows? I'm kind of been always bored on linux
Sep 16 11:51:03 <lain98>	how do i fix X/wayland. i changed some config files last week and i dont remember what i touched. i'd just like to have a fresh start

Sep 16 11:55:11 <robban>	Sorry, mixed up One and Core ! Whats the best way to manage a number of RPis running Ubuntu Core? It will be around 100-200 devices

Sep 16 12:02:33 <TJ->	robban: I'd suspect Canonical would point you at Landscape as the management agent... though I'm not sure if it can manage core/snaps as you would want
Sep 16 12:04:47 <robban>	TJ- Thanks. Yes, something along those lines. I was thinking abount using ansible towards the machines, but I have not found any docs on that at all.
Sep 16 12:06:15 <SpiritHorse>	ansible or saltstack
Sep 16 12:06:19 <SpiritHorse>	rest are fighting for scraps
Sep 16 12:06:31 <Habbie>	robban, docs on what precisely? i presume these are mostly still linux machines with working ssh
Sep 16 12:11:13 <TJ->	Does anyone else only here "buun" in this pronunciation example at wikipedia? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-Ubuntu_pronunciation.oga#

Sep 16 12:16:57 <TJ->	SpiritHorse: thought so... I'm on a RaspPi and firefox doesn't play sound so douwnloaded it, just wanted to be sure it hadn't gone 'wrong' locally
Sep 16 12:28:16 <dollarWoman>	hello, how can i know ram size?
Sep 16 12:28:58 <bitx8>	dollarWoman: free -m
Sep 16 12:29:03 <dollarWoman>	thanks
Sep 16 12:30:42 <Xat`>	hello guys ! I get 'unmet dependencies' when installing packages. But as you can see, the needed packages with required versions are available : https://paste.ee/p/tG01B . So why it says 'unmet dependencies' ?
Sep 16 12:46:04 <TJ->	Xat`: that isn't Ubuntu, those package versions are Debian
Sep 16 12:47:02 <Xat`>	TJ-: you're right
Sep 16 12:48:44 <Xat`>	TJ-: but, maintainer are ubuntu developers
Sep 16 12:48:57 <Xat`>	original maintainers are debian
Sep 16 12:52:22 <TJ->	Xat`: oh, I see what you mean. The packages were a direct import into Ubuntu wouthout changes though so it is possible there's an issue originating in Debian
Sep 16 12:54:34 <TJ->	Xat`: what command did you issue to trigger the install?
Sep 16 13:06:18 <Xat`>	TJ-: apt-get install shibboleth-sp2-utils libapache2-mod-shib2
Sep 16 13:07:57 <TJ->	Xat`: is that with 18.04 Bionic ?

Sep 16 15:58:57 <Killerherts>	So I originally install Ubuntu with partitional file system since it was my 2nd install I did not want to complicate things. Now my media server have been expanded accross several hds and is just to spread out to find anything. I know I have to reinstall to use lvm to cure then problem. Do I also need to off load the data from all my hard drives
Sep 16 15:58:58 <Killerherts>	and format them again. Or will that not be necessary
Sep 16 16:01:39 <sarnold>	yeah you can't do in-place swaps
Sep 16 16:02:20 <Habbie>	if you can offload -one-
Sep 16 16:02:27 <Habbie>	you can lvm that one, move data back onto it, offload the next one, etc.
Sep 16 16:02:45 <Killerherts>	Oh my ok that was my next question
Sep 16 16:03:08 <Killerherts>	Jesus this is going to be a long day that no one can watch TV on.
Sep 16 16:04:17 <Killerherts>	There is not a more elegant solution I'm not thinking of correct lol. ( Prays for miracle)
Sep 16 16:04:46 <sarnold>	well, *elegant* sounds like buying a new pile of six hard drives and installing zfs and moving everything over :D
Sep 16 16:05:16 <Habbie>	Killerherts, there are way *less* elegant solutions that might limit downtime
Sep 16 16:07:56 <Killerherts>	Lol sarnold that will be a hard sell to the wife. Ok well looks like I'm backing up some tbs today to get this converstion going
Sep 16 16:08:41 <sarnold>	in truth you could probably just do eg two 8tb or 10tb drives, I hear you can get good ones in a usb enclosure for something like $180.. and 10tb would fit most people's media collectoins
Sep 16 16:09:05 <sarnold>	buying more drives than that are just to put off having a full pool for a few years
Sep 16 16:10:49 <Killerherts>	This is ultimately where it's all going I need an excuse to learn how to set up lvm so I can say I know a little bit about it
Sep 16 16:11:25 <Killerherts>	Seems like you gotta break a few things in Linux before you can really understand it
Sep 16 16:13:04 <sarnold>	definitely that's a good inccentive to learn how to fix things :) thogh hopefully there are easier ways
Sep 16 16:15:02 <Killerherts>	I'll keep poking around your zfs input is now my new Google rabbit hole
Sep 16 16:15:09 <Killerherts>	Thanks for the help
Sep 16 16:15:56 <sarnold>	Killerherts: https://pthree.org/2012/12/04/zfs-administration-part-i-vdevs/  my favourite series of blog posts :)
Sep 16 16:17:38 <Killerherts>	Nice thanks well looks like I got some reading to handle thanks

Sep 16 16:39:21 <bogn>	Hi everyone, there's a package update for wireshark which seems to fix CVE-2019-12295 but the changelog includes a point saying "Non-maintainer upload". With a security update I'm sort of wary to apply it from a non-maintainer without understanding at least part of the background. Is this a normal procedure?
Sep 16 16:45:17 <OerHeks>	bogn, hi, you are referring to https://usn.ubuntu.com/4133-1/ ?
Sep 16 16:45:42 <OerHeks>	CVE-2019-12295 and CVE-2019-13619
Sep 16 16:45:48 <bogn>	Yes
Sep 16 16:50:16 <bogn>	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=929446#17
Sep 16 16:50:17 <ubottu>	Debian bug 929446 in src:wireshark "wireshark: CVE-2019-12295" [Grave,Fixed]
Sep 16 16:51:16 <OerHeks>	bogn, i think you can trust these archives, they come from debian ? https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/bionic-updates/wireshark
Sep 16 16:51:24 <OerHeks>	git
Sep 16 16:52:21 <tonyt>	debian has its own repos seperate from ubuntu's OerHeks
Sep 16 16:54:12 <OerHeks>	tonyt, the original maintainer is Balint Reczey ( debian)
Sep 16 16:54:20 <tonyt>	k
Sep 16 16:54:31 <OerHeks>	that is where we got the sources from, to be more precise
Sep 16 16:54:33 <sarnold>	balint maintains wireshark for both debian and ubuntu. he's a canonical employee.
Sep 16 16:56:44 <sarnold>	bogn: the ubuntu security team sponsors updates prepared by community members. we work with our community members to ensure the fixes come from upstream authors
Sep 16 16:57:05 <sarnold>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures gives some guidelines

Sep 17 10:35:03 <freannrak>	What could be the reason for media keys working when the keyboard is connected via usb and not working when it's connected via bluetooth only? `sudo showkey -k` doesn't output anything.
Sep 17 11:01:43 <afidegnum>	even though i just added a swap partition which i forgot to configure earlier, my systems is very slow
Sep 17 11:01:48 <afidegnum>	how do i speed it up?
Sep 17 11:02:18 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: what kind of system do you have? cpu/ram/hd-ssd?
Sep 17 11:04:06 <afidegnum>	i have a good 4Gb of RaM, amd AMD a65200 2.00 Ghz with 230Gb of HDD
Sep 17 11:05:07 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: with ubuntu-desktop on gnome?
Sep 17 11:05:41 <afidegnum>	ubuntu desktop
Sep 17 11:05:49 <afidegnum>	18.04
Sep 17 11:06:16 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: im affraid those specs are a bit low for gnome in combo with a spinner HD, unless you start deep wteaking things
Sep 17 11:06:37 <Ascavasaion>	afidegnum, LXDE desktop might help.
Sep 17 11:06:42 <afidegnum>	ok
Sep 17 11:06:44 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: so your best bets are, lubuntu, xubuntu ot tweak gnome more
Sep 17 11:06:51 <lotuspsychje>	*or
Sep 17 11:07:01 <Ascavasaion>	afidegnum, I run Lubuntu on a Dual Core laptop and it runs fine.
Sep 17 11:08:00 <afidegnum>	what do i in install in adition to have lxde desktop? or l/xubuntu ?
Sep 17 11:08:56 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: you can install lubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop from your current install to test, but we reccomend if you like one, to clean install the flavour of choice
Sep 17 11:09:06 <lotuspsychje>	!flavours | afidegnum see also
Sep 17 11:09:06 <ubottu>	afidegnum see also: Recognized Ubuntu flavors build on Ubuntu and provide a different user experience out of the box. They are supported both in #ubuntu and in their flavor channel. For a list, see https://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu-flavours
Sep 17 11:09:19 <Seveas>	 /win 32
Sep 17 11:09:20 <afidegnum>	which is lighter one? between them?
Sep 17 11:09:23 <akemlenovo>	BTW swap will not really help speed up things, it's here to help if you get low on RAM mainly and it's on the hard drive so it's not that speed. Maybe your system could support another 4GB ram stick inside.
Sep 17 11:09:59 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: in normal cases lubuntu is lightest, but i had machines before running smoother on xubuntu
Sep 17 11:10:08 <afidegnum>	ok
Sep 17 11:10:18 <lotuspsychje>	afidegnum: testing it on your personal hardware is reccomended to see
Sep 17 11:11:00 <akemlenovo>	You can also try Cinnamon instead of Gnome.
Sep 17 11:16:21 <Ascavasaion>	afidegnum, I am running Lubuntu on four of my computers here at home, and Xubuntu on another Asus Transformer Book
Sep 17 11:17:05 <Ascavasaion>	For what that info is worth.
Sep 17 11:27:00 <mfoo>	Hi, is there a channel specifically for Landscape? My server is unresponsive and is returning OperationInProgress (has been for about a day). I can see it's writing what looks like binary data to postgres and I can see postgres has ~10 landscape-user queries running ROLLBACK, but otherwise I don't have much information.
Sep 17 11:31:05 <sarnold>	mfoo: I haven't seen one, #ubuntu-server exists but it's kind of hit-or-miss about these things; a bug report or support request would be better, I think
Sep 17 11:31:10 <afidegnum>	ok
Sep 17 11:31:26 <mfoo>	sarnold: thanks
Sep 17 11:34:31 <lotuspsychje>	!landscape | mfoo

Sep 17 11:36:05 <raddy>	Hello Everybody
Sep 17 11:36:58 <raddy>	I would like to learn kubernetes and Helm charts in Linux
Sep 17 11:37:27 <raddy>	I have a laptop with HyperV support from hardware and software
Sep 17 11:38:02 <raddy>	So, shall I install ubuntu on top of that and explore or better to install directly /
Sep 17 11:40:13 <sarnold>	raddy: excellent question; the ubuntu-on-windows thing is still pretty new. if you like to try and test and fiddle and file bug reports, running it there would be nice :D but if you just want sometihng to work, then installing ubuntu directly would probably be better
Sep 17 12:01:03 <pomeha>	is there a way to figure out reboot reason?
Sep 17 12:17:18 <elias_a>	pomeha: Would this be of any help? https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9819/how-to-find-out-from-the-logs-what-caused-system-shutdown
Sep 17 12:18:44 <pomeha>	elias_a: unfortunately no. I had googled that too.
Sep 17 12:19:06 <pomeha>	there's no /var/log/acpid, there's no /var/log/messages/ and journalctl remembers only 1 (current) boot :/
Sep 17 12:19:24 <pomeha>	`last -x` seems to be kinda useless
Sep 17 12:19:43 <tds>	did your system cleanly reboot, or just reset out of the blue?
Sep 17 12:19:52 <tds>	and you probably want /var/log/syslog rather than messages
Sep 17 12:32:18 <natten>	Anyone got any suggestions why this request just sits there until it times out when running from google cloud function but not from local?
Sep 17 12:32:19 <natten>	Curl from cloud function -> https://hastebin.com/xijisizono.txt
Sep 17 12:32:36 <pomeha>	tds: that's what I'd like to figure out. And no, syslog is useless :(
Sep 17 12:33:00 <tds>	oh? it should normally be quite obvious in syslog if the machine rebooted cleanly or not
Sep 17 12:33:41 <TJ->	pomeha: what Ubunty release is it?
Sep 17 12:38:19 <OerHeks>	natten, don't crosspost, you know what -vk does ?
Sep 17 12:39:09 <natten>	OerHeks: Well yeah, verbose and to not verify the ssl connection
Sep 17 12:39:33 <natten>	It doesn't work without them if thats what you're asking
Sep 17 12:40:08 <natten>	Also tried to copy the capath and cacert locally to see if that did anything. Nothing happened
Sep 17 12:40:34 <natten>	Sorry for the crosspost but im at a loss here, and really need to get this working somehow
Sep 17 12:40:36 <OerHeks>	oh oke, that would be my 2nd question
Sep 17 12:42:21 <OerHeks>	i have no clue then :-(
Sep 17 12:46:51 <tds>	natten: most of the times I've seen tls hang after the handshake like that is mtu issues
Sep 17 12:47:19 <tds>	http is often fine, as is ssh until you send a load of text at once and hit the mtu
Sep 17 12:48:00 <natten>	tds: Sounds likely, how would i go about debugging / fixing it?
Sep 17 12:49:30 <tds>	a dump check would be to drop the mtu on your default route
Sep 17 12:52:32 <natten>	tds: not really sure on how to check what the mtu is in the cloud function. Its ubuntu, but ifconfig and ip are not there
Sep 17 12:52:59 <tds>	hmm, missing ip sounds odd
Sep 17 12:53:12 <tds>	can you `dpkg -l iproute2`?
Sep 17 12:53:57 <natten>	i lied ip is not missing, but it returns "EOF on netlink\nDump terminated"
Sep 17 12:54:03 <natten>	when calling ip addr
Sep 17 12:59:19 <natten>	tds: seems like you were correct though. When lowering my mtu to 1400 locally i experience the same behavior
Sep 17 12:59:38 <natten>	Do you know what i can do to fix this? I guess increasing the mtu on the cloud function is difficult
Sep 17 12:59:55 <tds>	can you add iptables rules on this "cloud function"?
Sep 17 13:00:05 <tds>	a typical solution would be to do mss clamping in iptables
Sep 17 13:00:59 <natten>	tds: i highly doubt i can do anything about it if it is not on application level in the cloud function
Sep 17 13:02:31 <natten>	Isn't there anything the api/server can do to "fix" lower mtu's?
Sep 17 13:27:41 <MrMojit0>	Good morning/afternoon/evening
Sep 17 13:27:59 <MrMojit0>	I am wondering what I am doing wrong. I am new to Linux world so also for Ubuntu. But I have a two running Ubuntu machines with both Nagios on it and running smoothly.
Sep 17 13:28:30 <MrMojit0>	But I cannot seem to get e-mails from one machine. So I tried to send a fake e-mail using: /usr/bin/printf "%b" "test" | /usr/bin/mail -s "test subject" user@xyz.com
Sep 17 13:28:54 <MrMojit0>	But I don´t get any email in my inbox
Sep 17 13:29:21 <MrMojit0>	So I looked into /usr/bin and I see that on the working machine I have the following installations "mail, Mail, mailq, mailx".
Sep 17 13:29:34 <MrMojit0>	But on the other machine where the email functionality is not working I only have "mailx"
Sep 17 13:29:55 <MrMojit0>	Does anyone here can help me to get on the right road?
Sep 17 13:31:48 <papin>	I don't know if `mail` is available on apt repo or not
Sep 17 13:36:37 <MrMojit0>	How can I verify that?
Sep 17 13:36:46 <ducasse>	MrMojit0: try installing mailutils
Sep 17 13:37:22 <MrMojit0>	I have installed it with: apt-get install mailutils
Sep 17 13:39:15 <MrMojit0>	Do I need to look into the help files to send a fake email to see if it is working
Sep 17 13:40:17 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Sep 17 13:42:51 <MrMojit0>	Hi
Sep 17 13:45:42 <MrMojit0>	@Papin @ducasse, I don have the e-mail working but I did installed mailutils on both machines and on the one it is falling and on the other works. So I guess it has to be something on network level / firewall.
Sep 17 13:45:55 <MrMojit0>	Thanks for helping me out I got a bit further here :D
Sep 17 13:49:04 <ducasse>	MrMojit0: what does  /etc/alternatives/mail point tò?
Sep 17 13:49:50 <nate>	Figure there may be someone awake now to answer; Anyone know what the switches for booting straight into a non-GUI (console/terminal) mode from grub would be in current ubuntu builds?  It used to be something along the lines of `nomodeset splash` but it doesn't seem to work anymore.  I tried `nomodeset text` I saw in some posts as well to no avail
Sep 17 13:51:36 <MrMojit0>	ducasse: I don´t know what to do in: /etc/alternatives/, if I open the mail with nano I get random symbols
Sep 17 13:52:22 <ducasse>	MrMojit0: 'ls -l  /etc/alternatives/mail'
Sep 17 13:53:10 <MrMojit0>	It points to the correct installation: /etc/alternatives/mail -> /usr/bin/mail.mailutils
Sep 17 13:53:31 <MrMojit0>	As for my other machine it points to: /etc/alternatives/mail -> /usr/bin/bsd-mailx
Sep 17 13:53:59 <MrMojit0>	The one that works is the bsd-mailx.
Sep 17 13:58:45 <ducasse>	MrMojit0: ok, i'm not sure what to suggest, try asking in #ubuntu-server. you might have to wait a bit for an answer.
Sep 17 13:59:36 <MrMojit0>	You helped me already more then enough. I will look further my self and find my way through this magical forest. Thanks Cheers!
Sep 17 14:04:01 <ducasse>	MrMojit0: look at the update-altenatives man page
Sep 17 14:06:32 <TJ->	MrMojit0: sounds like you need to install "bsd-mailx" and ensure it is the choice for "update-alternatives --display mail"
Sep 17 14:06:53 <MrMojit0>	I can do that no worries let me handle that TJ-
Sep 17 14:07:35 <MrMojit0>	ducasse I don´t know what update-alternatives man page is, sorry for this question but I don´t know what it is. Still noob with linux
Sep 17 14:10:23 <TJ->	MrMojit0: on Debian-derived distributions like Ubuntu there is a policy to provide [man]ual pages for every command. The tool to read them is called "man", so "man update-laternatives" will give you an overview and is usually more explanatory than doing, for example, "update-alternatives --help"
Sep 17 14:10:43 <TJ->	oops, typo, "man update-alternatives"
Sep 17 14:16:38 <MrMojit0>	I tried to understand but I do not get it. Shall I not first look into the firewall/network
Sep 17 14:16:55 <rigel_>	in my alsamixer, There is [Master] [Headphone] [Speaker] [PCM]... volume bars. The [Headphone] bar controls both the laptop's external earplugs/headphones and the internal speakers. The [Speaker] label/volume bar does jack. How do I align them properly?
Sep 17 14:17:33 <rigel_>	This is only a problem because when i unplug the headphones that level gets set to 0 and i have to manually turn it up everytime.
Sep 17 14:19:30 <BluesKaj>	rigel_, after setting your levels in alsamixer run, sudo alsactl store, that should hold the volume settings
Sep 17 14:20:03 <rigel_>	but the [Speaker] bar should control the internal speakers, that's my real gripe here
Sep 17 14:21:48 <__monty__>	Hi, I'm trying to install an i386 package (ghc) on a CI ubuntu box that seems to have a ton of held packages. Is there a better way to get this installed than iteratively adding whatever dependency apt-get complains about to the command and rerunning?
Sep 17 14:23:30 <sarnold>	__monty__: dpkg --get-selections should let you find what's held, you can sed those to install or whatever, then feed that back into dpkg --set-selections, then an apt-get install -f will probably upgade everything. but you might want to talk to whoever held all those packages first.
Sep 17 14:24:25 <__monty__>	sarnold: There's no "hold" in --get-selections output. Only install/deinstall.
Sep 17 14:24:41 <sarnold>	__monty__: hmm. am I misremembering or are there no held packages? :D
Sep 17 14:24:49 <BluesKaj>	rigel_, I don't have speaker vol ctl so I'm not sure how it interacts with other ctls, but make sure the automute ctl is disabled
Sep 17 14:24:51 <sarnold>	I've only done that once or twice in twenty years..
Sep 17 14:25:49 <rigel_>	no it's enabled, because when i disable it and plug in the headphones, both the headphones and the speakers play
Sep 17 14:25:51 <__monty__>	sarnold: I'm not sure. I read the --get-selection advice elsewhere. All I know is apt-get install complains about held packages and --get-selection doesn't actually list any as "hold".
Sep 17 14:27:09 <sarnold>	__monty__: apt also has some repo pinning, that *might* show the same thing, but I've never actually usd pinning, so I'm less sure of what it looks like
Sep 17 14:36:41 <__monty__>	Well, manually adding packages to the command has gotten me further along. Though now it's failing because dpkg can't start the php 7.3 fpm?
Sep 17 14:38:08 <__monty__>	I don't think I care about php-fpm in this instance so can I simply remove it before? Or will it be pulled in as a dep anyway?
Sep 17 14:39:17 <sarnold>	that depends entirely upon your local configuration / application

Sep 17 14:50:09 <raddy>	Please help
Sep 17 14:51:59 <ioria>	raddy, sudo systemctl restart gdm3
Sep 17 14:52:27 <raddy>	ioria: I have tried restarting the server itself, still no go
Sep 17 14:52:43 <ioria>	raddy, dpkg -l | grep  gdm3
Sep 17 14:52:51 <raddy>	I think I should not have installed the gnome desktop using tasksel
Sep 17 14:52:58 <ioria>	raddy, dpkg -l | grep  gdm3
Sep 17 14:54:12 <raddy>	okk
Sep 17 14:54:28 <ioria>	is installed or not ?
Sep 17 14:55:19 <raddy>	ioria: No.
Sep 17 14:55:33 <ioria>	raddy, sudo apt install --reinstall vanilla-gnome-desktop
Sep 17 14:55:34 <raddy>	ioria: I am not sure what has tasksel done
Sep 17 14:55:38 <ioria>	raddy, sudo apt install --reinstall vanilla-gnome-desktop
Sep 17 14:55:39 <raddy>	I installed now
Sep 17 14:56:03 <raddy>	I hope apt install gnome-session would be suffice
Sep 17 14:56:07 <raddy>	Isn't it ?
Sep 17 14:56:32 <sarnold>	why would you not run what ioria asked you to run?
Sep 17 14:58:58 <raddy>	I ran what ioria has suggested
Sep 17 14:59:21 <raddy>	Is gnome vanilla desktop is light weight or ubuntu desktop ?
Sep 17 14:59:44 <raddy>	I know both are heavy, but still which one is lighter among them
Sep 17 16:19:17 <codedmart>	I see you can order the Dell Precision 5540 with Ubuntu installed. It has a Quadro T1000 nVidia card. Does that mean it is using the propietery drivers probably? Are those very reliable in linux these days?
Sep 17 16:19:27 <codedmart>	Haven't had a nVidia card for years.
Sep 17 16:20:12 <lotuspsychje>	codedmart: the nvidia drivers are decent on ubuntu these days, alot of version choices too
Sep 17 16:20:21 <lotuspsychje>	!nvidia | codedmart see the ppa
Sep 17 16:20:21 <ubottu>	codedmart see the ppa: For nvidia and matrox graphics cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto . For AMD/ATI graphics cards, see « /msg ubottu ati » and « /msg ubottu fglrxmissing » For the latest Nvidia drivers see https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
Sep 17 16:21:13 <pragmaticenigma>	codedmart: that sounds like a question you would have to ask Dell as far as how they configured the machine
Sep 17 16:21:42 <codedmart>	Right I get that. I assumed that because nouveau doesn't have OpenGL support for those cards yet.
Sep 17 16:21:47 <sarnold>	codedmart: I understand nvidia drops old cards pretty quickly
Sep 17 16:22:02 <sarnold>	codedmart: depending upon the age of the card it may go easier or worse
Sep 17 16:22:15 <OerHeks>	the 430 supports Quadro T1000 and T2000 https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/148435/en-us
Sep 17 16:22:46 <codedmart>	I really want a new thinkpad and am looking at the p1 just cause I want the power. Which also comes with the Quadro T1000.
Sep 17 16:22:47 <OerHeks>	you might want the driver ppa https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
Sep 17 16:23:57 <codedmart>	sarnold: What is old? I mean after a few years or...?
Sep 17 16:24:30 <lotuspsychje>	codedmart: well lets say graphics cards that go below the 390 version, might have bad luck
Sep 17 16:25:00 <sarnold>	codedmart: no idea :) I don't follow nvidia real close, I just know I've seen a few complaints from people who find their cards are no longer supported before they expected
Sep 17 16:25:01 <lotuspsychje>	codedmart: but then there's always lubuntu/xubuntu
Sep 17 16:25:57 <codedmart>	So anyone have suggestions/recommendations on a thinkpad? Is the p1 a good one? Should I consider something else? I at least need 32gb of ram which cuts out my original thought of x1c.
Sep 17 16:26:34 <lotuspsychje>	codedmart: the hardware choice is really what you need it to be
Sep 17 16:26:55 <lotuspsychje>	codedmart: we can only help with the ubuntu side of things
Sep 17 16:26:56 <sarnold>	yeah :( I really like my x1c but I wish it had 32 or 64 gigs of ecc...
Sep 17 16:27:26 <codedmart>	Well I am always concerned with getting the most compatible laptop for linux as well which is why I ask
Sep 17 16:27:51 <codedmart>	I prefer just the intel gpu, but it is hard to find powerful laptops with just that.
Sep 17 16:28:19 <lotuspsychje>	codedmart: alot of machines will run fine with ubuntu, if you choose latest ryzens there might be some kernel fights..
Sep 17 16:28:26 <codedmart>	I considered the T460s as well since I can get 32gb of ram. But the CPU is much less then the P1. Just trying to weight everything out.
Sep 17 16:29:20 <codedmart>	OK so even with a Quadro T1000 I should be ok? I mean ideally I could just turn that card off and use the integrated, but I suspect the external will require the nVidia for that.
Sep 17 16:30:01 <ioria>	codedmart, that card is  based on the Turing architecture (TU117 chip), so it should be supported by nouveau  too
Sep 17 16:30:33 <rexwin_>	i set the DNS as
Sep 17 16:30:34 <rexwin_>	nameserver 127.0.0.53 nameserver 52.36.5.248
Sep 17 16:30:45 <rexwin_>	in /etc/resolv.conf
Sep 17 16:31:01 <rexwin_>	but it doesnot resolve using the windows DNS server
Sep 17 16:31:05 <Sven_vB>	can I have a script be triggered each time someone tries to login on text console with a non-existing username, and have that username passed to the script?
Sep 17 16:31:07 <codedmart>	ioria: I was told it was, but without OpenGL.
Sep 17 16:31:17 <ioria>	maybe
Sep 17 16:31:50 <codedmart>	OK thanks for all the info everyone.
Sep 17 16:33:54 <ioria>	codedmart, i suggest the 5.3 kernel in any case
Sep 17 16:34:48 <TJ->	Sven_vB:  yes I think there is a PAM module to do things like that
Sep 17 16:35:11 <ioria>	only Turing TU116  in 5.3...
Sep 17 16:37:09 <Iarla>	I have a laptop running 18.04. It's Core 2 Duo so it can't really handle the desktop. What's an alternative desktop environment I can download that wont interfere too much with the users who stay on Unity/Gnome Shell?
Sep 17 16:38:31 <tonyt>	larla you can try lxde desktop enviroment by doing sudo apt-get get update, sudo apt-get install lxde lxsession
Sep 17 16:39:02 <tonyt>	then reboot the machine and log in with the lxde option
Sep 17 16:42:59 <codedmart>	ioria: Only TU116 in 5.3? Didn't you say Quadro T1000 is TU117?
Sep 17 16:43:05 <ioria>	yep
Sep 17 16:43:48 <ryuo>	Iarla: you can't move to something a few years newer? even an ancient ivy bridge would be a real improvement.
Sep 17 16:44:26 <rexwin_>	resolve.conf get overwritten. how to avoid that?
Sep 17 16:45:11 <ryuo>	rexwin_: you don't necessarily but you can work with whatever is managing the settings.
Sep 17 16:45:47 <tds>	what's it being overwritten by? most tools that do that will leave a comment at the top of the file
Sep 17 16:45:51 <rexwin_>	i want to set dns servers and it gets overwritten after 5-10 minutes
Sep 17 16:46:13 <ryuo>	rexwin_: for what matter, what version are you using?
Sep 17 16:46:16 <ryuo>	that*
Sep 17 16:46:22 <rexwin_>	18
Sep 17 16:46:32 <ryuo>	desktop? server?
Sep 17 16:46:43 <DigbyMW>	What name does Ubuntu use for X/X11/X Window System? I have installed xorg and now i just want to run x on it
Sep 17 16:47:09 <ryuo>	DigbyMW: The X server is called X but you don't usually start it that way.
Sep 17 16:47:40 <ryuo>	normally use a display manager or startx for manual starts.
Sep 17 16:47:58 <DigbyMW>	Well, usually i'd do "startx fluxbox"
Sep 17 16:48:10 <DigbyMW>	But for once i'm not using fluxbox and don't know what name to use
Sep 17 16:48:29 <ryuo>	it'll fallback to whatever is defined in your .xinitrc
Sep 17 16:48:35 <rexwin_>	desktop
Sep 17 16:49:15 <ryuo>	rexwin_: you're probably using network manager. you can't configure the DNS from there?
Sep 17 16:49:33 <DigbyMW>	Ryuo, is x installed by default with xorg?
Sep 17 16:50:01 <ryuo>	DigbyMW: ... it *should* be. 'X' is the server. you can't start it without it.
Sep 17 16:50:15 <ryuo>	DigbyMW: but you normally use another method to start it.
Sep 17 16:50:25 <ryuo>	e.g., start or a systemd service
Sep 17 16:50:31 <ryuo>	startx
Sep 17 16:50:33 <DigbyMW>	i am aware. this is an unusual usecase
Sep 17 16:50:37 <TJ->	DigbyMW: usually there's a display manager, and it is controlled via "systemctl start display-manager.service"
Sep 17 16:51:09 <DigbyMW>	i'm using ubuntu server, so no display manager or any such thing is installed at the moment
Sep 17 16:51:18 <DigbyMW>	and i don't want to use one
Sep 17 16:51:41 <BluesKaj>	rexwin_, in systemd the dns settings can be setup in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
Sep 17 16:52:19 <tds>	on most ubuntu desktop installs resolved has its config pushed to it from network-manager over dbus - so do what ryuo said :)
Sep 17 16:53:10 <DigbyMW>	just to be clear, i'm talking about trying to run the x window system, the window manager traditionally provided with x server. i have always been able to do this with fluxbox, openbox etc. i'm just not sure what the package for x window system is called
Sep 17 16:53:42 <Sven_vB>	or can I bind scripts to function keys in the text console login prompt? currently F1 just prints ^[[[A, I'm sure pretty much no-one uses that as part of their username. would be much more useful if that ran my script.
Sep 17 16:54:12 <DigbyMW>	startx just goes to black and then brings me back to my tty so it isn't defaulting to x window system if it *is* installed
Sep 17 16:56:21 <Iarla>	ryuo: not in this case, no. I know there are smaller-footprint desktops, just not sure how theyl'l affect the Unity user.
Sep 17 17:36:44 <shreds>	Hi! I'm using uswsusp to hibernate my XPS laptop. But for the past weeks, it hibernates without actually shutting down so I need to manually reboot my laptop and lose everything that was supposed to be "saved". I noticed I'm all over the place trying to reconfigure uswsusp properly, do I really need pm-utils for this? I noticed I can trigger hibernation via systemd, pm-utils, s2disk, etc. What is really THE tool I need?
Sep 17 17:36:44 <shreds>	thx
Sep 17 17:38:19 <shreds>	I tried setting hibernate_mode to shutdown, also set /sys/power/disk to [shutdown] I noticed it always sets itself back to [platform] could that be part of my problem?
Sep 17 17:42:26 <tomreyn>	you should mention which ubuntu and kernel version you're on, whether there are related logs (and if so, share them).
Sep 17 17:45:44 <shreds>	good idea! I'm currently on Ubuntu 19.04 with Kernel 5.3.0 but the problem has been happening for the past month or so and back then I was on Ubuntu 18.10 with kernel 5.1.* and 5.2.*
Sep 17 17:46:20 <shreds>	that's the damn thing, there's no s2disk logs at all, I can't see anything in syslog/dmesg/pm2-suspend says everything is okay, I cannot find any logs or erroneous messages to get a hint from :(
Sep 17 17:49:23 <tomreyn>	https://askubuntu.com/questions/16239/how-to-debug-suspend
Sep 17 17:49:55 <tomreyn>	i know hibernation (to disk) is not suspend (to ram), but debugging should be similar
Sep 17 17:50:30 <tomreyn>	also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspend
Sep 17 17:52:12 <shreds>	I'll check these out thanks! @tomreyn
Sep 17 17:55:17 <tomreyn>	also consider setting up a serial console (if that's possible on this system, probably not on a laptop) to see late and early kernel output which cannot be logged to disk (yet during early boot, or no more during suspend)
Sep 17 17:57:22 <tomreyn>	shreds: the first think you shouldprobably do, though, is to ensure you have the latest 'bios' installed, and to inspect your system logs, looking for (not only, but especially) acpi issues during boot.
Sep 17 17:59:01 <tomreyn>	https://iam.tj/prototype/enhancements/Windows-acpi_osi.html may help you work around a buggy / windows version centric acpi impementation of your mainboard firmware.
Sep 17 18:00:20 <shreds>	@tomreyn I'll see what I can do to debug this as best as I can. I'm fairly new to that kind of kernel level debugging but I want to learn more about it so I can debug these kind of issues in the future. About the bios, that's what I suspect to be honest, I did a bios upgrade not long ago and I don't know if I'm just crazy but it seems to stem from that upgrade :-/
Sep 17 18:00:44 <shreds>	I'll keep that close, thanks a lot, that's a good beginning. At least if I can debug it myself I'd be very happy hehe
Sep 17 18:02:09 <tomreyn>	shreds: you can post    journalctl -b | nc termbin.com 9999    if you like, and (while i'm not really qualified either), i'll be happy to put a second pair of eyes on those logs.
Sep 17 18:06:18 <shreds>	@tomreyn I have nothing to lose so here it is: https://termbin.com/yuym hehe xD thx a lot for your help I appreciate
Sep 17 18:06:29 <Lutinmalin>	Hi, can anyone help a noob with a lxqt-powermanagement issue? My battery is not detected, but seen by lshw
Sep 17 18:08:11 <Lutinmalin>	I tried some acpi_osi fix script but that didn't solve the issue
Sep 17 18:15:25 <lotuspsychje>	Lutinmalin: for acpi related issues, you can also try to update bios to latest, some cases can solve aswell
Sep 17 18:16:22 <Lutinmalin>	lotuspsychje: thx, will look into that
Sep 17 18:17:12 <lotuspsychje>	Lutinmalin: the fwupdate project has also some recent updates, you might wanna check that first on your own system to update bios
Sep 17 18:21:12 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, you can install conky to test if it' s an acpi issue or a lxqt issue
Sep 17 18:21:53 <Lutinmalin>	acpi command doesn't show any battery
Sep 17 18:22:49 <tomreyn>	shreds: sorry, been afk for a bit, looking now
Sep 17 18:22:55 <Lutinmalin>	only lshw does ioria
Sep 17 18:23:00 <shreds>	tomreyn: np :P
Sep 17 18:24:44 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, upower -i `upower -e | grep 'BAT'`
Sep 17 18:25:20 <Lutinmalin>	no, upower neither :/ ioria
Sep 17 18:25:50 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, you mean command not found or blank output ?
Sep 17 18:25:57 <Lutinmalin>	blank ioria
Sep 17 18:26:34 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, is it plugged ?
Sep 17 18:26:48 <Lutinmalin>	right now, yes, but I tried unplugged too
Sep 17 18:26:53 <shreds>	tomreyn: I noticed something weird. Running s2disk does not the SAME as running `echo disk > /sys/power/state` (this prints PM related messages but still works alright)
Sep 17 18:27:04 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, what laptop is that ?
Sep 17 18:27:20 <Lutinmalin>	hp pavillon x2 tablet pc
Sep 17 18:28:12 <Lutinmalin>	I tried that too ioria: http://iam.tj/prototype/enhancements/Windows-acpi_osi.html
Sep 17 18:28:27 <Lutinmalin>	no luck
Sep 17 18:31:14 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, what kernel ?
Sep 17 18:33:29 <ioria>	Lutinmalin,  uname -r
Sep 17 18:34:01 <tomreyn>	shreds: i think you should try to make systemd's hibernation work, if any.
Sep 17 18:34:17 <Lutinmalin>	ioria: 5.0.0-27-generic
Sep 17 18:34:38 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, a bug probably
Sep 17 18:34:42 <ioria>	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upower/+bug/1606159
Sep 17 18:34:43 <ubottu>	Launchpad bug 1606159 in upower (Ubuntu) "Battery not recognized on HP Pavilion Detachable X2 10-N123NF" [Medium,Confirmed]
Sep 17 18:34:44 <tomreyn>	shreds: i assume video.only_lcd=0 is to overcome a backlight issue? i only see few mentions of it online, and a kernel patch which i assume made it into 4.17 (so you should no longer be affected)
Sep 17 18:36:10 <Lutinmalin>	ah... reported in 2016 :/
Sep 17 18:37:23 <Lutinmalin>	I'll try a bios update, and if that doesn't help, is there a lightweight distro that might not have this issue ioria ?
Sep 17 18:37:47 <shreds>	tomreyn: yes it was for a backlight issue. I also noticed my /swapfile partition does not have any UUID but for example in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume I have a UUID so maybe a partition misconfiguration? I have a hard time figuring out the difference between systemd hibernation, pm-utils and the rest of the different ways of hibernating. I'd like to keep only one of them and make it work.
Sep 17 18:37:58 <shreds>	What worked before was having uswsusp handle it all with systemd, I had pm-utils installed but I don't believe I used it
Sep 17 18:38:28 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, you 're already using lxqt ; you can try lxde ....
Sep 17 18:38:35 <shreds>	FYI I have the same parition UUID in /etc/default/grub and /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
Sep 17 18:38:44 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, less charge, but the issue will be the same
Sep 17 18:39:26 <tomreyn>	shreds: make sure the UUID listed in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume is correct, or that you remove the file, then run    sudo update-initreamfs -k all -u
Sep 17 18:39:46 <Lutinmalin>	a pity... okay big thanks anyway ioria
Sep 17 18:39:48 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, read this  (not sure about the fix btw): https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Battery-recognition-Linux/td-p/7040710
Sep 17 18:40:58 <tomreyn>	shreds: it is correct when it points to a swap partition which has this same UUID, is active (swapon), and is at least slightly larger than your installed physical RAM
Sep 17 18:40:59 <shreds>	tomreyn: I'm getting dizzy from going in circles lol sorry about that but I just realized I don't HAVE a partition since I use a file on the disk to hibernate! it's on my main parition in /swapfile.
Sep 17 18:41:50 <shreds>	tomreyn: my /swapfile is about 17GB and my ram is 16GB. swapon still says /swapfile file  17G   0B   -2 which seems to be okay
Sep 17 18:41:57 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, in few words, he states that it works on Fedora but not on ubuntu
Sep 17 18:42:02 <Lutinmalin>	guess I'll try Fedora then ioria, is that somewhat light?
Sep 17 18:42:27 <tomreyn>	shreds: i guess a swapfile should also work. be sure to remove the incorrect resume configuration then and to update-grub and update-initramfs
Sep 17 18:42:28 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, idk fedora, but i guess you can install anothe desktop env on it
Sep 17 18:42:53 <Lutinmalin>	desktop env is gnome kde and the likes?
Sep 17 18:43:07 <shreds>	tomreyn: the UUID I point to is my own linux parition which seems right since the /swapfile is on there
Sep 17 18:43:43 <tomreyn>	shreds: and an offset is given, then i guess it is fine.
Sep 17 18:43:47 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, yes, go with lxqt or lxde
Sep 17 18:44:30 <Lutinmalin>	is that something I have to choose before downloading the iso, during install or later? ioria
Sep 17 18:44:53 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, as i said, i don't know fwdora; sorry try its channel
Sep 17 18:44:53 <shreds>	tomreyn: resuming always went fine so I guess that part is okay, it's the whole hibernate that won't shutdown thing that messes everything up for me :-/ here's the GRUB line with the offset: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=UUID=cc859e63-da11-476d-b094-62d8a834e851 resume_offset=26736640 video.only_lcd=0"
Sep 17 18:45:22 <Lutinmalin>	understood thanks ioria :) will try bios update first
Sep 17 18:45:32 <ioria>	Lutinmalin, sure, gl
Sep 17 18:45:56 <shreds>	I guess I could get rid of pm-utils altogether since I don't seem to use it at all
Sep 17 18:48:42 <tomreyn>	shreds: it's in universe, so can't be essential, so i guess that'll be fine.
Sep 17 18:50:03 <tomreyn>	the same goes for uswsusp (which provides s2disk)
Sep 17 18:50:49 <shreds>	but to hibernate on disk I read often that I explicitly needed uswsusp otherwise there was no support for on disk hibernation. maybe I just read something outdated though
Sep 17 18:51:12 <shreds>	I'll try to find more about it though, if I can remove pm-utils and uswsusp to keep it as light and simple as possible it'd be great
Sep 17 18:51:15 <shreds>	that's a good first step, I'm trying to remove everything that isn't needed. I will try to do as you said and make the basic systemd hibernation works by itself and go from there trying to debug. I was trying to debug everything at once and got lost but now I should be able to make some progress thanks to you :P @tomreyn
Sep 17 18:51:58 <marcoagpinto>	guys?! What is this on 19.04?: https://i.imgur.com/iWBMdSH.png
Sep 17 18:52:09 <marcoagpinto>	lots of lines of text while booting
Sep 17 18:52:42 <marcoagpinto>	and so far it didn't get to the login screen
Sep 17 18:55:51 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, that doesn't tell us much. Have you tried recovery mode? Did 19.04 boot on this machine before?
Sep 17 18:56:06 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, it's progress information so you can see what your system is doing. with a bit of experience this can help you estimate how much longer it will need until you can do stuff.
Sep 17 18:56:54 <lordcirth_>	Yeah, the boot text is normal; and it doesn't tell us what's preventing you from getting a login
Sep 17 18:57:12 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, if you prefer a greeter image, try press F2, that should switch between greeter image and progress info.
Sep 17 18:57:37 <lordcirth_>	Sven_vB, I think he wants help getting it to finish booting, first...
Sep 17 18:58:08 <marcoagpinto>	yes
Sep 17 18:58:16 <marcoagpinto>	it doesn't show login
Sep 17 18:58:30 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, it might need more time to prepare
Sep 17 18:58:46 <marcoagpinto>	but? it is the first time it happens?
Sep 17 18:58:56 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, what happens usually instead?
Sep 17 18:58:57 <marcoagpinto>	I never seen this text before?
Sep 17 18:59:04 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, So 19.04 booted normally before? How long ago?
Sep 17 18:59:11 <marcoagpinto>	day 10
Sep 17 18:59:17 <willksm>	marcoagpinto, try and press F2
Sep 17 18:59:29 <lordcirth_>	F2 isn't going to start gdm
Sep 17 18:59:47 <marcoagpinto>	F2 does nothing :((((
Sep 17 18:59:52 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, see if you can boot into recovery mode.
Sep 17 19:00:14 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, is the text a problem for you? it's not harmful if that's what you were worried about. especially if most of them are green and "OK".
Sep 17 19:00:28 <lordcirth_>	Sven_vB, the problem is, as he said, it's not finishing boot
Sep 17 19:00:30 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, when there's something to worry it will be shown in orange or even red
Sep 17 19:00:57 <Sven_vB>	lordcirth_, that's why I asked what happens usually instead
Sep 17 19:00:57 <tomreyn>	shreds: you may be right when you say some of these utilities are required - i really do not know. if you read up on systemd-special(7) looking for "hibernate" you'll see how systemd instruments it, and can then inspect those targets.
Sep 17 19:01:15 <marcoagpinto>	Buaaaaaaaaaaa
Sep 17 19:01:15 <tomreyn>	... to see how hibernation actually works.
Sep 17 19:01:17 <marcoagpinto>	Buaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Sep 17 19:02:35 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, not helpful. Does recovery mode work?
Sep 17 19:03:04 <marcoagpinto>	well, I still see the text and no login screen... should I poweroff the VM?
Sep 17 19:03:44 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, yes, reboot it and boot to recovery.
Sep 17 19:03:55 <marcoagpinto>	how do I boot to recovery?
Sep 17 19:04:14 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, so is your problem that it doesn't boot quickly enough? you could SSH in and check the logs
Sep 17 19:04:42 <marcoagpinto>	Sven_vB: I have 19.04 since .04 (April) and it is the first time I see this text
Sep 17 19:04:56 <marcoagpinto>	usually it takes a few seconds to the login screen
Sep 17 19:05:20 <Sven_vB>	it take that as "yes it doesn't boot as quickly as expected"
Sep 17 19:05:36 <marcoagpinto>	yes, it doesn't boot as quickly as usual
Sep 17 19:06:11 <marcoagpinto>	I have updated the two VMs with 18.04 and I didn't see any text on them
Sep 17 19:10:02 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, at the grub menu, you choose advanced options, then recovery.
Sep 17 19:10:15 <marcoagpinto>	ahhh... let me try
Sep 17 19:12:32 <marcoagpinto>	ohhhh... no GRUB :) I don't know how to make it appear... but in the reboot it said "recovering journal... orphanated something"
Sep 17 19:12:40 <marcoagpinto>	and now it got to the login screen
Sep 17 19:13:42 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, hmm, so it only happened once? That's interesting. What's the most recent change in /var/log/apt/history.log?
Sep 17 19:13:58 <tomreyn>	shreds: so, upon further inspection it doesn't seem like systemd needs any of these extra utilities to carry out hibernation, it provides its own. see also systemd-hibernate.service(8)
Sep 17 19:13:58 <marcoagpinto>	let me check
Sep 17 19:16:58 <shreds>	@tomreyn really? even for on disk swapfiles? that's interesting, I'll go check these docs out. sorry I got out to grab something to eat hehe
Sep 17 19:18:04 <marcoagpinto>	lordcirth_: https://pastebin.com/4ahGRs72
Sep 17 19:18:17 <MibixFox>	can someone help me with formatting a drive so I don't lose a bunch of space to reserved root and too many i-nodes
Sep 17 19:18:17 <tomreyn>	shreds: yes. "Note that scripts or binaries dropped in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ are intended for local use only and should be considered hacks." however, those 'hacks' seem to ususlly work. ;) enojy your food.
Sep 17 19:18:28 <MibixFox>	I used to have a command I used but I cant remember it
Sep 17 19:18:53 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, tunefs can adjust the number or percentage of reserved blocks
Sep 17 19:19:04 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, tune2fs
Sep 17 19:19:10 <lordcirth_>	marcoagpinto, hmm, there was a systemd update on the 11th, that might be related. But if it doesn't happen again, you can probably ignore it.
Sep 17 19:19:22 <marcoagpinto>	ahhhhh
Sep 17 19:19:25 <marcoagpinto>	lordcirth_: thanks :)
Sep 17 19:19:28 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, also mkfs.ext3 should have an option to do so initially
Sep 17 19:19:37 <marcoagpinto>	what is systemd?
Sep 17 19:19:38 <marcoagpinto>	:)
Sep 17 19:20:19 <Sven_vB>	marcoagpinto, systemd is the services manager that manages what needs to be done to prepare your computer for interactive use.
Sep 17 19:20:29 <MibixFox>	Sven_vB im doing it intially the drive is empty im just not sure on the exact make2fs command
Sep 17 19:20:46 <shreds>	@tomreyn that's very interesting, I'll try to strip all extra tools out and go from there to see what happens. I never took the time to read systemd docs properly, that's a quite good learning experience so far :P
Sep 17 19:21:04 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, man mkfs.ext2 (or …3 or …4=
Sep 17 19:21:20 <marcoagpinto>	ahhhhhhhh
Sep 17 19:21:24 <MibixFox>	ok one sec let me make the line and you tell me if its right lol
Sep 17 19:22:38 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, how about you just try it on a small file and check the result? :)
Sep 17 19:23:37 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, you can use "truncate --size=20M diskfile" to create a 20 MB file named "diskfile", then use that as the target "disk" for mkfs
Sep 17 19:23:43 <shreds>	i.e. s2disk is part of the uswsusp package, s2disk is what seems to be used by my systemd config at the moment: /etc/systemd/system/systemd-hibernate.service.d/override.conf = https://termbin.com/5o49
Sep 17 19:24:34 <shreds>	so I guess if I get rid of uswsusp I'll need to remove that override.conf but still I don't know if it will still suspend to disk like it used to, I'll have to try it out
Sep 17 19:29:31 <tomreyn>	shreds: it should still be able to do so, if systemd's implementation is sound. i assume /etc/systemd/system/systemd-hibernate.service.d/override.conf exists on your system as a result of installing and enabling uswsusp
Sep 17 19:30:41 <shreds>	@tomreyn:  just tried to echo disk > sys state to test hibernation on the kernel level and it did exactly the issue I talk about: everything is suspended but the laptop is still powered on the keyboard lighting works but nothing respond so I need to reboot
Sep 17 19:30:55 <shreds>	I got rid of the override.conf after removing uswuspsp
Sep 17 19:31:49 <tomreyn>	shreds: if "got rid of" == "rm" that's maybe not the right approach.
Sep 17 19:32:16 <tomreyn>	the issue you're describing is most likely a firmware issue, though
Sep 17 19:32:26 <shreds>	I commented the code I side it. But I don’t think I ran the tool to update systemd on an after thought
Sep 17 19:32:35 <shreds>	Yeah sounds like that most definitely
Sep 17 19:33:03 <MibixFox>	Sven_vB I think this is what I want mkfs.ext4 -L R -m 0 -b 4096 -N 1000000 -E lazy_itable_init=0 -V /dev/sdf1
Sep 17 19:33:05 <shreds>	Really sounds like 1) kernel update messed it up or 2) bios update messed it up
Sep 17 19:33:33 <MibixFox>	label it as R, 0 reserved, 4096 block size, 1 million i-nodes, the fast way, location of device to format
Sep 17 19:33:49 <tomreyn>	shreds: since no bios update is available for this system at this time, you could try to experiment with http://iam.tj/prototype/enhancements/Windows-acpi_osi.html in the meantime. and try a supported ubuntu kernel, too.
Sep 17 19:33:57 <Sven_vB>	MibixFox, in case you hoped so, I won't go to the hassle of decoding short options.
Sep 17 19:35:37 <Sven_vB>	it's a shame mkfs.ext3 still doesn't have descriptively named long options even in bionic.
Sep 17 19:36:03 <Sven_vB>	I take that back, it was xenial I chacked
Sep 17 19:36:06 <Sven_vB>	*checked
Sep 17 19:36:23 <shreds>	I could try to downgrade kernels to Ubuntu’s last supported version. I’ll check the acpi debug too at this point I really want to find out what’s wrong. It used to work so well a few weeks ago
Sep 17 19:37:01 <MibixFox>	that seems right though
Sep 17 19:37:33 <MibixFox>	i specify the device location at the end like that, correct?
Sep 17 19:37:47 <tomreyn>	!bootlog | shreds: you may also want to set these (and remove 'quiet', add 'nosplash') in /etc/default/grub's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to get visible output when your system shuts down and boots up.
Sep 17 19:37:47 <ubottu>	shreds: you may also want to set these (and remove 'quiet', add 'nosplash') in /etc/default/grub's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to get visible output when your system shuts down and boots up.: To get a more verbose log of the boot process, add the following !kernelparm: debug systemd.log_level=info
Sep 17 19:39:35 <shreds>	tomreyn: I already have them removed, I hate splash screens :P I like to see if something goes wrong on boot hehe
Sep 17 19:39:41 <shreds>	I don't have the info kernel param though, that's nice to know!
Sep 17 19:39:52 <shreds>	!kernelparm: debug systemd.log_level=info
Sep 17 19:39:52 <ubottu>	shreds: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
Sep 17 19:40:05 <tomreyn>	!kernelparm
Sep 17 19:40:05 <ubottu>	To add a one-time or permanent kernel boot parameter see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters
Sep 17 19:41:14 <B|ack0p>	hi
Sep 17 19:41:25 <shreds>	thx!
Sep 17 19:43:48 <tomreyn>	no need to *downgrade* the kernel, i'm just suggesting you also try the supported one, such as by making sure it's still installed, and choosing to boot it from the grub menu
Sep 17 19:44:37 <entry_lvl_dev>	is there a linux terminal program that can detect an multiple images in one image file and give the ability to crop them.
Sep 17 19:44:52 <shreds>	since I removed uswsusp I see PM: restoring the suspended image instead of s2disk but it still works
Sep 17 19:45:09 <shreds>	it still bugs out from time to time (same issue) but it still fully hibernate and resume half the time
Sep 17 19:45:23 <entry_lvl_dev>	for instance, lets say i have one png file that haves 4 pictures in them... can the program detect those 4 images and then give you the ability to crop all four out?
Sep 17 19:45:46 <shreds>	so only need to go bug hunting now! at least I got rid of extra utilities I didn't needed at all
Sep 17 19:46:15 <shreds>	tomreyn: I'm using ukuu to manage kernel versions, so reinstalling, switching, removing any versions is very easy to do, it's worth a try
Sep 17 19:47:06 <tomreyn>	shreds: i prefer simple shell scripts over somewhat complex third party C code for this task.
Sep 17 19:47:10 <shreds>	one question though: the logs I see when the system is hibernating and resuming: I don't find it in dmesg, etc
Sep 17 19:47:20 <shreds>	oh one thing weird in journal logs: Sep 17 13:45:37 xps kernel: Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 20 on CPU 0.
Sep 17 19:47:20 <shreds>	Sep 17 13:45:37 xps kernel: Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
Sep 17 19:47:20 <shreds>	Sep 17 13:45:37 xps kernel: Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
Sep 17 19:47:31 <tomreyn>	!paste | shreds
Sep 17 19:47:32 <ubottu>	shreds: For posting multi-line texts into the channel, please use https://paste.ubuntu.com | To post !screenshots use https://imgur.com/ !pastebinit to paste directly from command line | Make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic.
Sep 17 19:47:49 <shreds>	sorry about that, I meant to paste a link and not the whole thing
Sep 17 19:49:59 <tomreyn>	dmesg only returns the currently running kernels' logs, and only those which fitted its buffer. at some point during shutdown / suspend / hibernation file systems are unmounted, which effectively prevents logs from getting written to disk.
Sep 17 19:50:36 <tomreyn>	so you may get to see more output on screen than end up on logs.
Sep 17 19:50:54 <shreds>	oh that's what I thought, makes sense
Sep 17 19:58:23 <tomreyn>	shreds: whats the context in which this NMI is triggered? is it while entering hibernation?
Sep 17 20:00:11 <MibixFox>	Sven_vB mke2fs -L R -m 0 -t ext4 -b 4096 -N 1000000 -E lazy_itable_init=0 -v /dev/DEVICEADDRESS ended up working :D
Sep 17 20:01:14 <shreds>	@tomreyn it was when booting up between 2 network/wifi related messages, seems unrelated but also another reason to debug for hardware issues like you suggested. I got hibernate to work a few times via echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk & echo disk > /sys/power/state but I'm still unsure what should be the proper command to execute. Does `sudo systemctl hibernate` make the same as manipulating /sys/power/disk & state? I
Sep 17 20:01:14 <shreds>	guess so?
Sep 17 20:01:40 <shreds>	I learnt so much about the kernel and systemd today, I hate to debug such things usually but I'm learning so much that I actually enjoy the ride hehe
Sep 17 20:05:21 <tomreyn>	shreds: "systemctl hibernate" is the command you should run to hibernate on 18.04 LTS and newer. altewrnatively triggering hibernation using the GUI also works, it should run the same command. as the systemd documentation i pointed you to earlier states, you should not write to /sys/power/* directly, but let system handle it.
Sep 17 20:11:39 <shreds>	tomreyn: ok thanks, I'm still going through all the docs I opened earlier, I'll get there eventually hehe I also read there's similar issues for NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD users which I have. Surely is related to hardware but why didn't this happen before? I'm also looking for any devices acting weird i.e. /proc/acpi/wakeup = https://termbin.com/utauu
Sep 17 20:15:21 <tomreyn>	shreds: you mentioned something which sounded like "before" was "before bios upgrade". if you think that's the case, maybe try downgrading the bios and compare (using the identical OS configuration and kernel version).
Sep 17 20:22:04 <shreds>	@tomreyn good point. so far it seems to work since I got rid of pm-utils/uswsusp. Now I even have better logging in dmesg. I have a hint pointing me hardware is messing with the hibernation: [ 2513.203392] ACPI: Hardware changed while hibernated, success doubtful! it still worked but it's the first time I see this message. Full logs here: https://termbin.com/ygys Getting closer and closer :D
Sep 17 20:28:38 <tomreyn>	shreds: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_make_ACPI_work#ACPI_S4_hardware_signature_mismatch lists a workaround to ignore the hardware signature mismatch.
Sep 17 20:30:29 <tomreyn>	shreds: in case you have a docking station, be sure to test hibernation first with the least complexity, which is without the dock, but with power cable plugged (ie. not running from battery).
Sep 17 20:34:24 <alexandrdvorkin>	hi guys
Sep 17 20:35:23 <immu>	hi
Sep 17 20:37:06 <alexandrdvorkin>	have a question I uninstalled the VB 6.10 and installed 6.0.12 but now my ubuntu installation is taken 6 gb not 3 gb I deleted the previous install of Ubuntu with ram -rf why ?
Sep 17 20:37:18 <shreds>	@tomreyn so far so good, I tested with or without the battery (I don't have a docking station), rebooted to a new session, etc and it works all of the time so far using only systemd directly :D :D :D I don't want to party just yet but hey that's progress! :D thanks a whole lot for your time and patience. I'll be reading the docs anyway just to make sure I'm better next time I need to debug something like that
Sep 17 20:37:47 <shreds>	so far so good without any downgrades whatsoever, let's hope it remains like that. Also it's FASTER than s2disk / uswsusp
Sep 17 20:39:43 <alexandrdvorkin>	is ubuntu install inside the VB6.0.12 ok to take 6Gb ?
Sep 17 20:41:54 <tomreyn>	shreds: you're welcome. looking at you latest log i notice your cpu temperature reaches 97°C, that's too hot. make sure you reduce the temperature soon.
Sep 17 20:42:37 <tomreyn>	(those readings could be wrong, of course, check also on  the bios setup in case it lists the values there)
Sep 17 20:45:55 <lordcirth_>	alexandrdvorkin, not sure I understand your question. You installed virtualbox in Ubuntu, or Ubuntu in virtualbox?
Sep 17 20:46:13 <alexandrdvorkin>	ubuntu in Vb
Sep 17 20:46:42 <lordcirth_>	alexandrdvorkin, ok, and what exactly is the problem? The virtual disk is growing?
Sep 17 20:47:40 <alexandrdvorkin>	I made 10gb for ubuntu now only 2.6 go is free after I made an install
Sep 17 20:48:08 <shreds>	tomreyn: that's weird since I juggle between 40C-80C when working with the machine. I rarely get to 100C but it's a known issues with XPS 9370 since they're too tiny for their CPUs to properly cool itself :-/ I noticed this too but touching the laptop with my bare hands don't make it seem THAT hot. That's weird, I wonder if these readings are right or not. I'll keep an eye open for this!
Sep 17 20:48:17 <alexandrdvorkin>	and I deleted the previous install of ubuntu that was installed with Vb6.0.10
Sep 17 20:48:56 <alexandrdvorkin>	so just an install taken up 6gb not 3gb as it says it should
Sep 17 20:49:05 <CarlFK>	I'm trying to make  .config/autostart/foo.desktop  - it 'works' (the thing runs) but it is ignoring Path=/home/runr/score/ (and yes to Type=Application here is the thing: http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/5Y4PGSNmfT/
Sep 17 20:49:46 <CarlFK>	bash because everyone has it and its shows what the curdir is
Sep 17 20:51:13 <EriC^^>	CarlFK: are you running it as the user runr?
Sep 17 20:51:40 <alexandrdvorkin>	is there another Ubuntu folder inside the Vb directory that I need to delete
Sep 17 20:51:46 <CarlFK>	EriC^^: 'yes' as in it runs when that user logs in

Sep 17 20:53:35 <EriC^^>	yeah sure buddy :)
Sep 17 20:53:49 <immu>	can we install KDE in Ubuntu 19.04 along with gnome?
Sep 17 20:54:06 <immu>	side by side
Sep 17 20:54:07 <lordcirth_>	you can install kubuntu-desktop
Sep 17 20:54:47 <immu>	but won't it mess up gnome? or your default installation?
Sep 17 20:54:53 <ioria>	a bit
Sep 17 20:55:11 <EriC^^>	it might need some tweaking
Sep 17 20:55:22 <immu>	like?>
Sep 17 20:55:50 <ioria>	immu, your /etc/xdg/autostart  will be full of kde processes when you run gnome
Sep 17 20:56:05 <lordcirth_>	And some of your default applications might change.
Sep 17 20:56:26 <EriC^^>	not 100% sure but for me lubuntu + unity on 16.04 used to cause lubuntu notification style appearing in unity stuff like that
Sep 17 20:56:50 <icharlz>	Hello all, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with a bug (https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2810) I need to address.  Is there a safe upgrade other than the openSSH package for Cosmic?
Sep 17 20:56:51 <ubottu>	bugzilla.mindrot.org bug 2810 in sshd "Broken compatibility with old SSH clients sending 1.99 identification" [Enhancement,Resolved: fixed]
Sep 17 20:57:35 <immu>	can't i containerze the kde install?
Sep 17 20:57:48 <EriC^^>	alexandrdvorkin: can you reiterate your problem?
Sep 17 20:58:41 <EriC^^>	immu: i dont think so, you could save the list of everything apt had to pull in and add in case you want to revert later i guess
Sep 17 20:58:52 <ioria>	immu, kde better to run alone in my op (you can always use kvm)
Sep 17 20:58:58 <immu>	ok
Sep 17 20:59:06 <immu>	i will stick with gnome for now :)
Sep 17 20:59:09 <EriC^^>	or possibly try it in a vm if you have one already, make a snapshot, install kde, then see how it goes
Sep 17 20:59:31 <avanasear>	that's a solid plan, using a vm to find out if you enjoy it first
Sep 17 21:01:40 <immu>	i know kde
Sep 17 21:01:56 <immu>	but i like gnome, before i use to like kde ,but i like the apps that KDE has
Sep 17 21:04:09 <immu>	goodnite foks
Sep 17 21:17:21 <MibixFox>	im confused why my OS on my server has this partition structure.... https://imgur.com/a/Yi2rF2Q
Sep 17 21:17:30 <MibixFox>	can i just resite my file system partition?
Sep 17 21:17:32 <MibixFox>	*resize
Sep 17 21:18:26 <lordcirth_>	MibixFox, you should be able to, but you should make sure you have backups first.
Sep 17 21:19:01 <MibixFox>	what is that extended partition for?
Sep 17 21:20:32 <EriC^^>	MibixFox: extended partition is where the logical partitions are
Sep 17 21:20:35 <tds>	MibixFox: what's the output of say `fdisk -l`? that extended partition is probably just a container for logical partitions, to let you go past the 4 partition limit from an mbr partitioned disk
Sep 17 21:21:13 <EriC^^>	MibixFox: it's not an actual partition that has a filesystem
Sep 17 21:21:46 <MibixFox>	yeah i mean its not actually taking up any space
Sep 17 21:22:11 <EriC^^>	MibixFox: what are you trying to do? integrate the free space into the OS?
Sep 17 21:23:08 <MibixFox>	https://pastebin.com/6SGF6eW8
Sep 17 21:23:32 <MibixFox>	yeah that is what i was thinking
Sep 17 21:23:46 <MibixFox>	I am going to migrate this single drive in to two new drives in RAID 1 in a few days though
Sep 17 21:25:52 <blb4393>	on my new computer the headphone jack plugged not recognized, so I have to switch manually. ubu 18.04. It never happened before so i'm kind of clueless. What could I check first?
Sep 17 21:30:27 <MibixFox>	EriC^^ I may just wait till I get the new drives installed and use Clonezilla to clone this over to the new RAID 1 array then try to expand it there if everything is working
Sep 17 21:30:34 <MibixFox>	easiest backup solution heh
Sep 17 21:37:07 <bray90820_>	How would I view what samb shares my 18.04 system has
Sep 17 21:37:41 <ioria>	net usershare info
Sep 17 21:40:48 <bray90820_>	ioria: That returns a blank line
Sep 17 21:41:14 <ioria>	bray90820_, then check your /etc/samba/smb.conf
Sep 17 21:42:04 <bray90820_>	Aaahhh there it is thanks

Sep 17 23:00:16 <nuala>	should resolvconf be installed by default, because it isnt here and for few days i experience seriously trouble in hostname resolving, actually cant update or install anything right now, ping, ssh everything without domains seems to work flawlessly though
Sep 17 23:03:57 <tomreyn>	don't forget to provide your ubuntu version number
Sep 17 23:04:12 <nuala>	oh 18.04 sry…
Sep 17 23:04:57 <tomreyn>	resolvconf is in universe, it's not installed by default.
Sep 17 23:05:10 <nuala>	ok… so im running down a wrong track here, thx :)
