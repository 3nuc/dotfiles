Sep 09 10:36:11 <threenuc>	When I'm on my website and I press hard reload all the time, the text on my page flickers (appears after a tiny delay). I thought the default behavior would be to load a fallback font first and then it would morph into the custom one? I just use font-family with like 5 fonts, no other tricks involved
Sep 09 11:40:03 <hunboy>	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display
Sep 09 14:41:18 <androi>	when i inspect my design with the chrome developer tool, every element is minimizing when using smaller resolution, what could be the reason for that?
Sep 09 14:49:32 <nwoob>	I can't set src in image tag like this <img src={`image.STEPPER_${this.state.completedSteps.length}`} />
Sep 09 14:49:35 <nwoob>	is there a way to acheive what I'm trying to do
Sep 09 14:55:10 <aruns>	nwoob: This is more of a JavaScript question
Sep 09 14:55:15 <aruns>	I presume you're using React?
Sep 09 14:55:21 <aruns>	Or a similar JS library
Sep 09 14:55:38 <aruns>	Might be better off asking in a channel such as #javascript
Sep 09 15:14:27 <androi>	after reducing the with underneath 980px each element is minimizing: https://codepen.io/androi1/pen/eYOVaWg
Sep 09 15:14:41 <androi>	any hints?
Sep 09 15:15:56 <linuxconformer>	why does -webkit-fill-available auto-adjust an iframe's height depending on the contents of the iframe, but -moz-available does not?
Sep 09 20:30:15 <ne555>	good morning, ¿how may I set the font globally per font-family? for example: all sans will be Helvetica and all serif will be Palatino
Sep 09 20:33:26 <GreenJello>	ne555, I don't think you can, but you could use css variables to avoid rewriting it eveywhere
Sep 09 20:34:48 <GreenJello>	https://jsfiddle.net/brigand/0s2qfx65/1/
Sep 09 20:35:07 <GreenJello>	er https://jsfiddle.net/brigand/0s2qfx65/2/
Sep 09 23:29:31 <adder>	hi, can someone help me figure out what's going on here, my css isn't being applied. I use class selectors and it doesn't work unless I chain them, id selectors work fine
Sep 09 23:30:08 <adder>	https://jsfiddle.net/do7ev6ms/ this is the fiddle but it's displayed correctly there
Sep 09 23:30:24 <adder>	in my case left margin is gone on article-title and article-info
Sep 09 23:32:41 <bin_bash>	well if it's working there then what are we supposed to debug?
Sep 09 23:34:21 <adder>	http://i.imgur.com/NUweJlz.png this :D
Sep 09 23:38:41 <adder>	maybe you could reproduce this: https://github.com/adder46/djangopractice/tree/master/src
Sep 09 23:41:07 <FunkyBob>	adder: perhaps continue on your fiddle until it displays the same faulty behavior
Sep 09 23:41:27 <adder>	I am trying to reproduce it there but no success
Sep 09 23:41:57 <FunkyBob>	which would suggest the problem is from farther afield than you're considering
Sep 09 23:43:13 <adder>	I copied entire HTML page and all related CSS files and it's displayed correctly
Sep 09 23:43:20 <adder>	literally everything, can't reproduce
Sep 09 23:43:29 <adder>	I read somewhere that something might be overriding something
Sep 09 23:51:37 <cliluw>	There is a website that crawls lots of websites and stores their CSS values. On this website, I can search for a particular CSS setting like "text-indent" and see what other sites set it to. Does anyone remember the URL of this site?
Sep 09 23:53:19 <bin_bash>	adder: inspect the element and go from there.
Sep 09 23:56:50 <adder>	bin_bash: http://i.imgur.com/1d71MRp.png
Sep 09 23:56:54 <adder>	it says margin: auto;
Sep 09 23:56:58 <adder>	I haven't set that anywhere
Sep 09 23:57:05 <adder>	when I uncheck that it goes back to normal
Sep 09 23:57:10 <bin_bash>	it'
Sep 09 23:57:14 <bin_bash>	ll tell you where it came from
Sep 09 23:57:22 <adder>	how
Sep 09 23:57:39 <bin_bash>	by looking at the rule? the inspector has the file
Sep 09 23:58:09 <adder>	http://i.imgur.com/hqzJaKT.png
Sep 09 23:58:10 <adder>	this?
Sep 09 23:58:48 <nateriver>	how can i do this with css and php?  https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_crop,h_862,w_1533,x_200,y_136/c_scale,q_auto,w_1920/fl_lossy,pg_1/pbakudcgxlfmmduw46iw/sole-supremacy-homepage
Sep 09 23:59:08 <nateriver>	so that the image source is perfectly over the desktop mockup thing
Sep 10 00:00:10 <oksushi>	nateriver: is the “site” just a screenshot? Or should it actually load the site?
Sep 10 00:00:46 <adder>	I see what's going on, nevermind
Sep 10 00:05:50 <AugustusCaesar24>	im working with this fiddle
Sep 10 00:06:02 <AugustusCaesar24>	how would i get the buttons to show on the blurry background
Sep 10 00:06:10 <AugustusCaesar24>	https://jsfiddle.net/AugustsCaesar/hkq4dpab/3/
Sep 10 00:07:09 <oksushi>	anything inside your mask is going to get blurred, AugustusCaesar24
Sep 10 00:07:10 <AugustusCaesar24>	https://jsfiddle.net/AugustsCaesar/hkq4dpab/4/
Sep 10 00:07:25 <AugustusCaesar24>	so how would i make sure the buttons dont get blurred
Sep 10 00:07:26 <oksushi>	you cannot “unblur” anything inside
Sep 10 00:07:52 <oksushi>	you would not blur the buttons, and instead place them in a separate element, positioned on top
Sep 10 00:08:23 <AugustusCaesar24>	so i would position them before the blur div?
Sep 10 00:10:13 <oksushi>	how much browser support do you need?
Sep 10 00:10:57 <AugustusCaesar24>	what do you mean?
Sep 10 00:11:42 <AugustusCaesar24>	could i do it the way this guy did it
Sep 10 00:11:43 <AugustusCaesar24>	https://jsfiddle.net/amirsaleem/beyyhb4q/
Sep 10 00:14:04 <oksushi>	AugustusCaesar24: an easy approach would be to use ::before https://jsfiddle.net/28hs9y0c/
Sep 10 00:15:15 <AugustusCaesar24>	thats nice
Sep 10 00:15:23 <AugustusCaesar24>	is the background blurred?
Sep 10 00:15:34 <AugustusCaesar24>	i have to look up ::before
Sep 10 00:15:41 <AugustusCaesar24>	seems very useful
Sep 10 00:41:44 <hmw_metalab>	div.innerHTML = "<p>My new paragraph<p>";   results in  <div><p>My new paragraph</p><p></p></div>  (extra <p></p>) Anyone here can explain this? Firefox, Chromium https://paste.asmcbain.net/a791d0f2
Sep 10 00:42:36 <hmw_metalab>	Web search and ##javascript have no answers. I can't be the only one annoyed by this...
Sep 10 00:42:51 <FunkyBob>	`paste @ hmw_metalab
Sep 10 00:42:51 <Selvvir>	hmw_metalab, These live pastebins allow us to see what you're seeing http://jsfiddle.net/ • http://codepen.io/ • http://paste.asmcbain.net/ • Screenshots can't be inspected with website debugging tools
Sep 10 00:42:56 <hmw_metalab>	^^
Sep 10 00:43:04 <FunkyBob>	oh, so you did... sorry
Sep 10 00:43:08 <hmw_metalab>	:)
Sep 10 00:44:07 <hmw_metalab>	I can work around it, but I'd like to find the spec that makes it "intended" or find out, what's going on
Sep 10 00:44:55 <FunkyBob>	https://jsfiddle.net/5fs7poge/
Sep 10 00:44:56 <FunkyBob>	very odd
Sep 10 00:45:03 <hmw_metalab>	Indeed
Sep 10 00:45:57 <hmw_metalab>	Even more odd is the fact, that nobody seems to have googled it before or asked about it
Sep 10 00:46:32 <FunkyBob>	oh, I know what it is
Sep 10 00:46:34 <hmw_metalab>	Guess, I have switched to another alternate reality. Again. Tomorrow everything will be fine again. I just need to go to bed.
Sep 10 00:46:44 <FunkyBob>		div.innerHTML = "<p>My new paragraph<p>";
Sep 10 00:46:47 <FunkyBob>	I can see it
Sep 10 00:46:55 <hmw_metalab>	have I ... really?
Sep 10 00:46:57 <FunkyBob>	you have two paragraphs because... you started two paragraphs
Sep 10 00:47:04 <hmw_metalab>	oh my
Sep 10 00:47:11 <FunkyBob>	and HTML5 auto-closed them for you
Sep 10 00:47:23 <hmw_metalab>	OK thanks! WAAAAH
Sep 10 00:47:51 <FunkyBob>	#css FTW! :)
Sep 10 00:47:54 <hmw_metalab>	Reality repaired.
Sep 10 00:48:47 <FunkyBob>	perception of reality amended
Sep 10 00:50:37 <hmw_metalab>	Note to self: Next time you get seriously stuck and Google has no answer, there is probably a silly reason.
Sep 10 00:50:59 <hmw_metalab>	Usually I give answers to others, who are stuck :)
Sep 10 00:54:37 <cliluw>	There is a website that crawls lots of websites and stores their CSS values. On this website, I can search for a particular CSS setting like "text-indent" and see what other sites set it to. Does anyone remember the URL of this site?
Sep 10 01:04:45 <FunkyBob>	hmw_metalab: we're all just people, helping people
Sep 10 01:05:04 <FunkyBob>	cliluw: sounds... fascinating
Sep 10 01:05:13 <hmw_metalab>	^ I'd like to see that too
Sep 10 01:07:17 <hmw_metalab>	that is hard to search for
Sep 10 01:10:46 <oksushi>	assume pebkac, of course
Sep 10 01:10:55 <hmw_metalab>	:)
Sep 10 01:11:07 <oksushi>	cliluw: sounds like Nerdydata, maybe?
Sep 10 01:11:34 <oksushi>	I mean, I know that allows you to search for HTML
Sep 10 01:13:10 <oksushi>	cliluw: TBH I don’t see how that would be at all useful though. If you want to know about CSS on a specific site, just use your browsers’ inspector tool
Sep 10 01:14:01 <cliluw>	oksushi: Seems different than the one I was thinking of because it doesn't show me the CSS value. Cool site though!
Sep 10 01:15:07 <cliluw>	oksushi: It's more for answering questions about the Internet in general. For instance, what percentage of websites use CSS grid.

Sep 12 12:19:27 <sine0>	damn what are those things called inside of elements like the class= style= aria-data=
Sep 12 12:19:44 <hmw_metalab>	attributes
Sep 12 12:19:54 <sine0>	thats it thanks
Sep 12 12:19:57 <sine0>	mind b0rk
Sep 12 12:22:13 <hmw_metalab>	It happens
Sep 12 12:23:59 <Lauxley>	Hello, using bootstrap4 (not sure if relevant) i'm trying to get the width of a panel but it changes slightly on page load, tried to catch transitionend to no avail, disabling transitions entirely didn't change anything, in the end i by luck removed the padding and it 'fixed' the issue, any idea what is going on?
Sep 12 12:40:40 <hmw_metalab>	hard to tell from a distance. It might be some ressource being added late in the loading process, like another CSS file, image or text content. Also, ...
Sep 12 12:40:44 <hmw_metalab>	`live @ Lauxley
Sep 12 12:40:44 <Selvvir>	Lauxley, Please provide a live page or a working demonstration of your problem to make it possible to debug. If it's local or private, copy your HTML and CSS into a `testcase in a `paste server like http://jsfiddle.net or http://codepen.io. Screenshots and plain text code pastes are difficult to debug.
Sep 12 12:41:53 <hmw_metalab>	Lauxley: you could remove as many blocks as possible piece by piece, to determine, where the glitch comes from
Sep 12 12:44:03 <Lauxley>	thx I tried to make a jsfiddle but it doesn't behave the same, I was hoping that removing the padding in a flexbox would ring a bell to somebody
Sep 12 12:56:28 <Lauxley>	hmw_metalab, Selvvir trying to add to the jsfiddle but it still behaves well there https://jsfiddle.net/ypofnw6h/
Sep 12 12:58:00 <hmw_metalab>	The padding on its own wouldn't do such a thing. It must be a combination of factors. Reduce your code as much as possible without removing the glitch and then paste that
Sep 12 12:58:08 <hmw_metalab>	Lauxley: ^
Sep 12 12:58:32 <oksushi>	Lauxley: “changes slightly on page load” may indicate if the page is longer than one viewport, you get a scrollbar, which may reduce width
Sep 12 12:58:50 <hmw_metalab>	hm!
Sep 12 12:58:56 <oksushi>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Sep 12 12:59:29 <hmw_metalab>	Lauxley: you can test oksushi's theory by adding overflow:scroll to your body
Sep 12 13:00:10 <Lauxley>	hmw_metalab, that's what I've been trying to do but it's a complex app with a lot thrown in there
Sep 12 13:00:30 <Lauxley>	thx oksushi going to try that
Sep 12 13:02:34 <Lauxley>	not the case unfortunately
Sep 12 13:03:41 <oksushi>	can you link to the troublesome page?
Sep 12 13:04:15 <Lauxley>	it's on a dev branch
Sep 12 13:06:02 <oksushi>	ngrok can help you to tunnel to your local
Sep 12 13:51:45 <feelextra>	Hello! is it just me being new to CSS or do more people besides me also feel that CSS3 Grid layout is a lot harder than Flexbox?
Sep 12 13:52:10 <feelextra>	basically every time I look at the Grid syntax I pass out mentally... the API is huge
Sep 12 14:35:02 <lilltiger>	feelextra: it's just you :p
Sep 12 15:12:36 <hmw_metalab>	feelextra: I recently had to catch up with the changes to CSS, since I had taken a years long break from web design, so I also had to read up about grid. It is quite a bit and took me several days to wrap my head around it. And I am a programmer. So, don't worry. - ...
Sep 12 15:13:17 <hmw_metalab>	feelextra: So let me suggest, you go to the MDN page for grids and start making small test pages, going slow with trying the next feature. Create a collection of templates for yourself, while learning the things piece by piece, like I did. It is not THAT hard after all. Have fun!
Sep 12 15:15:07 <hmw_metalab>	I still have no idea about flex box stuff, btw :)
Sep 12 15:15:25 <hmw_metalab>	But grids are making things so much easier
Sep 12 15:15:53 <hmw_metalab>	no more floating inlineblocks and stacking position over position and cursing display:table for being stupid
Sep 12 15:16:46 <feelextra>	hmw_metalab: hah! that's a great writeup. thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts :-)
Sep 12 15:17:26 <hmw_metalab>	welcome to #css
Sep 12 15:18:55 <feelextra>	hmw_metalab: the reason I feel Flexbox is easier is because the API is small: `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-direction` give you almost all functionality you need (there are also stuff like `flex-grow` which is a bit harder to wrap the head around though)
Sep 12 15:20:12 <feelextra>	thanks for the welcome! appreciate it
Sep 12 15:20:22 <hmw_metalab>	Grids work great for me, when I would like to use table layout, but without the table weirdness
Sep 12 15:22:18 <feelextra>	Honestly the code interface to CSS really sucks. Interactive GUIs would be much more efficient. Wondering what the best professionals are using for that.
Sep 12 15:22:30 <hmw_metalab>	Notepad
Sep 12 15:22:35 <hmw_metalab>	or vim, in this case
Sep 12 15:23:01 <hmw_metalab>	Hm
Sep 12 15:23:09 <stennowork>	vscode ueber alles
Sep 12 15:23:34 <feelextra>	hmw_metalab: if they are using code interfaces then that's inefficient. I wouldn't say somebody with that interface is very productive unless they have etched the CSS rules into their brain's neurons.
Sep 12 15:23:57 *	hmw_metalab looks into the mirror and sees a lot of selectors
Sep 12 15:24:17 <hmw_metalab>	CSS is hard to learn at start, but not really so hard to use, once you know your stuff
Sep 12 15:24:48 <feelextra>	heh. that reminds me i've seen a VScode extension that walks the fine line between a GUI and a code editor. I gotta check it out sometime.
Sep 12 15:24:56 <hmw_metalab>	'divitis @ feelextra: avoid falling in to the trap of
Sep 12 15:25:01 <hmw_metalab>	meh
Sep 12 15:25:05 <hmw_metalab>	`divitis
Sep 12 15:25:05 <Selvvir>	hmw_metalab, Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
Sep 12 15:25:17 <hmw_metalab>	^ truth
Sep 12 15:25:51 <lilltiger>	feelextra: with grid there is: grid-gap, grid-template-areas, grid-template-columns and with just those you can handle moste cases :D
Sep 12 15:26:01 <stennowork>	people should really internalize what HTML is supposed to do and what CSS is supposed to do
Sep 12 15:26:07 <stennowork>	then you can't even have 'divitis'
Sep 12 15:27:16 <lilltiger>	and try to use <header><section><main><article><footer> tags insted of div when appropriate
Sep 12 15:27:41 <hmw_metalab>	I should finally finish my article about web design basics...
Sep 12 15:27:57 <hmw_metalab>	atm I wouldn't like to show it around, also it is dated
Sep 12 15:28:32 <feelextra>	lilltiger: why should I use those tags?
Sep 12 15:28:40 <feelextra>	what technical difference does it make?
Sep 12 15:28:45 <stennowork>	feelextra, semantics
Sep 12 15:28:48 <stennowork>	HTML is semantic
Sep 12 15:28:57 <lilltiger>	feelextra: readability, so much easier to see the layout of the page then with just a bunch of div
Sep 12 15:29:00 <stennowork>	so a screen reader, for example, has some hints
Sep 12 15:29:03 <feelextra>	these semantics aren't being processed any differently by the client
Sep 12 15:29:09 <stennowork>	feelextra, false
Sep 12 15:29:09 <hmw_metalab>	feelextra: You are less likely to use non-semantic class names like "top-area" or "green-leftalign-text"
Sep 12 15:29:32 <feelextra>	stennowork: what's a screen reader? is that a software?
Sep 12 15:29:50 <thykka>	using only divs is like writing everything on a post-it note. using semantic elements is where you write events into a calendar, greetings into a postcard and resignation letters onto a formal letter
Sep 12 15:29:53 <stennowork>	feelextra, yes, a software for people who have impaired sight
Sep 12 15:30:32 <feelextra>	stennowork: so your point for using semantics is actually for accessibility concerns?
Sep 12 15:30:39 <stennowork>	among others, yes
Sep 12 15:31:00 <stennowork>	its one of the arguments for a semantic markup which is strictly seperated from styling (like in html5)
Sep 12 15:31:06 <hmw_metalab>	my approach is some sort of a role play; The first actor is the author, who writes a text, just like in Notepad, but they put the "hyper" in the text: Marking pieces for what they are: Headings, explanations, citations, listings, etc. Then the Designer takes over and isn't allowed to add any HTML. They have to do everything in CSS.
Sep 12 15:31:22 <hmw_metalab>	Following semantic standartds will also automatically help you avoid certain mistakes
Sep 12 15:31:40 <stennowork>	yes - HTML has NO information about actual styling
Sep 12 15:31:58 <lilltiger>	feelextra: accessibillity and readability for your own sake and other devs that is going to work with the page, esp in months to years time. The better structure the easier to understand and adjust.
Sep 12 15:32:06 <hmw_metalab>	Look at http://www.csszengarden.com/219/ - CSS with semantic HTML may be considert Art
Sep 12 15:32:17 <lilltiger>	well gtg :D
Sep 12 15:32:37 <thykka>	some elements also have specific default styles and/or functionality.. Consider using <dt> and <dd> tags vs. rolling your own expanding element script with div tags..
Sep 12 15:33:02 <feelextra>	lilltiger: ok i guess for code readability. honestly code sucks for user interfaces so it seems like a low yield effort.
Sep 12 15:33:07 <thykka>	or using <div>1. foo</div><div>2. bar</div> for a numbered list, instead of <ol>
Sep 12 15:33:22 <stennowork>	yet still the default UA stylesheet is a recommendation
Sep 12 15:34:03 <hmw_metalab>	I believe, the majority of benefits in sticking to semantics these days lie with keeping your code well organized, clean and therefore small, fast and efficient.
Sep 12 15:34:48 <thykka>	users with screenreaders would disagree. after all, we don't make these sites for ourselves and other developers, but for the users that actually use the site
Sep 12 15:35:06 <hmw_metalab>	Also, imagine you have to program some server side thing that spits out HTML with a lot of layout mixed in and then, a few years later, your boss wants the page to look totally different. If you messed up, you have to refactor EVERYTHING. If done properly, only a new CSS file does the trick. Also, you can provide alternate style sheets for a page. See CSS Zen Garden
Sep 12 15:35:06 <thykka>	or at least we SHOULDN'T be making them for ourselves...
Sep 12 15:35:50 <feelextra>	thykka: yea there are two reasons i've gathered here so far. my last reply only addressed the "code readability" argument.
Sep 12 15:36:43 <feelextra>	"accessibility" is the other argument for semantic elements. sure if the software people are using detects these elements and gives them meanings then that has clear value to users.
Sep 12 15:37:09 <hmw_metalab>	feelextra: A good ressource is https://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/ (I just picked the first random link from my collection, read them all)
Sep 12 15:44:20 <feelextra>	ahh I found the link to that " VScode extension that walks the fine line between a GUI and a code editor" I mentioned earlier: https://gimli.app/
Sep 12 15:49:24 <hmw_metalab>	LOL @ a video about vscode, I am watching right now. It opens, how to set it up in a way, that "no addon can steal your CPU and you are always able to save and restart the IDE"
Sep 12 15:50:28 <thykka>	wouldn't the solution be just; don't install a crapton of addons?
Sep 12 15:51:02 <hmw_metalab>	IDK, I use vim without any addons...
Sep 12 15:51:14 <hmw_metalab>	I just wanted to learn a but about this Gimli
Sep 12 15:51:18 <hmw_metalab>	about
Sep 12 15:51:42 <hmw_metalab>	Looks like this is one of the main devs of VSCode talking
Sep 12 15:51:56 <hmw_metalab>	But that isn't a very promising start :)
Sep 12 15:53:31 <thykka>	haven't personally experienced either of those issues.. and i've been using VSC for a while
Sep 12 15:58:50 <hmw_metalab>	I certainly depends on the plugins and perhaps on the language servers, if VSCode uses such things
Sep 12 16:45:25 <lawsa>	I have a div with inputs in it. I would like the div to be no bigger than the inputs inside, but it's really wide. When I inspect the inputs, it looks like they have right margin filling up the whole width. How do I get this to go away?
Sep 12 16:45:56 <stennowork>	display: inline-block; for the div
Sep 12 16:46:23 <lawsa>	https://imgur.com/xdlFEwh.png
Sep 12 16:46:24 <lawsa>	Thanks!
Sep 12 16:49:09 <lawsa>	div a is inside div b. div b has margin-right:auto!important;  (I would like div b to be centered horizontally inside div a.) It's currently left-aligned. I checked and div a is very wide so that div b should not be all the way to the left.
Sep 12 16:49:20 <lawsa>	I tried adding display:inline-block; to div a, but no joy :-)
Sep 12 16:49:43 <stennowork>	`testcase @ lawsa
Sep 12 16:49:43 <Selvvir>	lawsa, a (pared-down) testcase is a page that isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styling and scripting. See `paste for services that easily let you create such testcases for others to see.
Sep 12 16:49:49 <lawsa>	drat. Okay :-)
Sep 12 18:24:28 <hunboy>	lawsa, do you want something similar? : https://jsfiddle.net/L1czwhjp/

Sep 12 19:17:52 <ALowther>	I have two containers, side-by-side with buttons at the bottom. The containers are of equal height, but due to the containing content being of different heights, the buttons are not in the same position in each container.

Sep 15 23:31:11 <visualshock>	Is setting flex-basis to 25rem and 75rem a good solution?

Sep 16 13:28:45 <adrian_1908>	I want to create a 2 column layout with a sidebar to the left (navigatio) and content to the right. I went this flexbox since that seems neater than the old `display: float` approach. However, I'm having difficulty making the columns use 100% of the window height. They're as high as their content only.

Sep 16 15:56:10 <Selvvir>	oksushi, These live pastebins allow us to see what you're seeing http://jsfiddle.net/ • http://codepen.io/ • http://paste.asmcbain.net/ • Screenshots can't be inspected with website debugging tools
Sep 16 15:58:10 <SlimmyJimmy>	It's a multi-page website with lots of .jpgs as backgrounds. Basically, my goal is simple. img elements are, by default, aligned to the bottom of the container element they are in, I wanted it to go at the top because the container switches sizes when different content is displayed. I wanted the img element to at least seem static.
Sep 16 15:59:02 <SlimmyJimmy>	Pinning the image to the parent container at a specific place seems pretty easy. I'm working on that now.

Sep 17 21:00:19 <hunboy>	depesz, https://jsfiddle.net/we5d3bcp/
Sep 17 21:01:01 <depesz>	hunboy: well, the idea is that it shouldn't overlap canvas. so technically, it should be outside of wrapper.
Sep 17 21:01:41 <jan6>	"doesn't make SEO confused" is the had part ;P
Sep 17 21:01:46 <jan6>	*hard
Sep 17 21:01:54 <hunboy>	depesz, https://jsfiddle.net/we5d3bcp/1/
Sep 17 21:02:37 <depesz>	hunboy:is there a way to put it to the right of the canvs? with bottom of span and canvs being on the same line?
Sep 17 21:02:52 <Speeder__>	my current site google thinks my menu is the content :( so ALL pages are found when I type menu words on the search, but the actual keywords find zero results :(
Sep 17 21:03:07 <hunboy>	depesz, yup left: 100%;
Sep 17 21:04:09 <depesz>	ouch, sorry. to the left. and having bottom lines of the span and canvas to be on the same "y" ?
Sep 17 21:04:24 <hunboy>	Speeder__, your problem is> there is no hover on handhelds.
Sep 17 21:04:45 <depesz>	hunboy:got it. thanks a lot.
Sep 17 21:04:52 <hunboy>	:)
Sep 17 21:14:45 <timmyalfoa>	How do I make a div blow out of it's container to 100 page width?
Sep 17 21:14:59 <timmyalfoa>	100% that should say.
Sep 17 21:15:57 <bin_bash>	timmyalfoa: did you try 100vw
Sep 17 21:18:04 <bin_bash>	timmyalfoa: https://jsfiddle.net/p8ber21v/
Sep 17 21:32:57 <Nyle>	oh man.
Sep 17 21:33:09 <Nyle>	You can't put margin on <tr>
Sep 17 21:33:15 <Nyle>	That's half a question and half a statement.
Sep 17 21:33:24 <Nyle>	:( but that's a full sad face.
Sep 17 21:33:35 <Nyle>	Is it possible to have spacing between the table row borders?
Sep 17 21:34:39 <hunboy>	border-spacing: 5px
Sep 17 21:34:55 <hunboy>	on table element
Sep 17 21:35:07 <Nyle>	hmm
Sep 17 21:35:19 <Nyle>	uno momento
Sep 17 21:35:54 <Nyle>	not taking effect on firefox dev edition, let me paste code in a bit
Sep 17 21:35:56 <Nyle>	on lunch
Sep 17 21:39:18 <timmyalfoa>	@bin_bash 100vw makes it overflow the browser and the overflow:auto isn't fixing it.
Sep 17 21:39:55 <bin_bash>	`live @ timmyalfoa
Sep 17 21:39:55 <Selvvir>	timmyalfoa, Please provide a live page or a working demonstration of your problem to make it possible to debug. If it's local or private, copy your HTML and CSS into a `testcase in a `paste server like http://jsfiddle.net or http://codepen.io. Screenshots and plain text code pastes are difficult to debug.

Sep 17 21:41:50 <bin_bash>	i dont see anything going off the screen
Sep 17 21:42:52 <timmyalfoa>	The galleries are what I'm trying to blow out the content width. the three static pages on bottom of the menu show the content width working well. there's borders for reference.
Sep 17 21:43:36 <timmyalfoa>	@bin_bash check now
Sep 17 21:44:40 <bin_bash>	still not seeing anything overflow
Sep 17 21:45:31 <timmyalfoa>	That;s your cache, the gallery overflows horizontally now.
Sep 17 21:46:19 <timmyalfoa>	the static pages, COntact, CV, and Press, are not overflowing but the tow gallery pages are.
Sep 17 21:46:22 <bin_bash>	there is no cache in incognito
Sep 17 21:46:39 <timmyalfoa>	two, jeez sorry for the typing.
Sep 17 21:47:35 <bin_bash>	are you using some wp cache or something

Sep 17 22:46:17 <bin_bash>	word
Sep 17 22:49:18 <bin_bash>	ya timmyalfoa i think your best bet is to either have a different template for the gallery, or use js to add a class that way you can just get rid of the max-width
