Aug 31 11:23:26 <wallfly>	Cant connect to the spotchat server anymore with HexChat since changing the values for automatic login.  Anyone have the default settings to share with me?
Aug 31 11:26:11 <esselfe>	how can I delete commits I made on github?
Aug 31 11:26:59 <ikanobori>	By deleting them locally and force pushing to github.
Aug 31 11:27:15 <ikanobori>	But nothing is ever really gone after it's been shared to the internet and in this case other people might have checkouts that depend on your commits.
Aug 31 11:27:18 <ikanobori>	So think before you do :)
Aug 31 11:28:43 <lesshaste>	how can I copy all the files called primdemo2-?.png to prime-?.png?
Aug 31 11:29:04 <lesshaste>	cp primdemo2-?.png prime-?.png doesn't work
Aug 31 11:29:06 <eviladmin>	perl-rename, bash parameter expansion
Aug 31 11:29:23 <eviladmin>	the later with a for loop
Aug 31 11:30:04 <mystic>	hi funkshon
Aug 31 11:32:47 <lesshaste>	eviladmin, could you give me a hand? I have started with for i in primdemo2-?.png ; do cp "$i" "${i/demo2*.png/.png}" ; done
Aug 31 11:32:51 <lesshaste>	but that isn't right
Aug 31 11:33:16 <wallfly>	oh!!  Hexchat irc has its own channel.  I will ask there
Aug 31 11:33:39 <coin_flipper>	lesshaste: there's a regex channel on here too, they've always been super helpful
Aug 31 11:34:17 <lesshaste>	coin_flipper,  thanks
Aug 31 11:36:21 <funksh0n>	mystic: which linux are you linuxing now?
Aug 31 11:36:23 <eviladmin>	lesshaste: as I said, requires for loop
Aug 31 11:36:33 <funksh0n>	did you drop MX, get your wifi working?
Aug 31 11:36:45 <lesshaste>	eviladmin, I tried for i in primdemo2-?.png ; do cp "$i" "${i/demo2*.png/.png}" ; done
Aug 31 11:38:28 <mystic>	im linuxing on ubuntu
Aug 31 11:38:46 <mystic>	the rest ended up a bit of a mess lol
Aug 31 11:38:56 <funksh0n>	it happens
Aug 31 11:39:03 <mystic>	but i disovered tails seems to run even better than lubuntu from usb
Aug 31 11:39:06 <funksh0n>	I hope you didn't pull out any hair or destroy any hardware
Aug 31 11:39:15 <mystic>	and you dont need to install it, just burn iso to usb is enough
Aug 31 11:39:34 <funksh0n>	yeah, tails is a live distro
Aug 31 11:39:36 <mystic>	so i guess thats what i will use as a travel portable os..
Aug 31 11:40:08 <mystic>	ni, i did remover me ssd tho when install lubuntu to usb.. less chance or messing up my boot again
Aug 31 11:40:24 <mystic>	live distro, i see..  they are convenient
Aug 31 11:40:43 <funksh0n>	they are
Aug 31 11:41:45 <mystic>	any other live distros i can try?  they are safe to try as far as i can see
Aug 31 11:41:50 <eviladmin>	just do ${v/demo2/}?
Aug 31 11:41:55 <funksh0n>	there are more convenient ones than tails, if your goal is usability.  Tails is really for whistleblowers, spies and dealers of illicit materials.
Aug 31 11:42:36 <eviladmin>	${v/demo2/e} even by going by the original question
Aug 31 11:42:46 <mystic>	yea, i couldnt get the 'non safe' browser to work in tials, had to use tor
Aug 31 11:43:26 <cluelessperson>	Is there some sort of repository software that allows you to group and manage groups of git repositories in various fashions?
Aug 31 11:43:31 <funksh0n>	mystic: there's good reason that they put massive warnings on the non-safe browser - tails is not meant for "normal" use.
Aug 31 11:43:36 <cluelessperson>	like, I might want to mirror the same repo for multiple groups
Aug 31 11:44:02 <cluelessperson>	as part of a "cryptography" grouping, and also "python"  and also "sub project"
Aug 31 11:44:07 <mystic>	yea, it seems to be strictly anonimity based
Aug 31 11:44:09 <lesshaste>	eviladmin, for i in primdemo-?.png ; do cp "$i" "${v/demo/e}" ; done
Aug 31 11:44:09 <lesshaste>	cp: cannot create regular file '': No such file or directory
Aug 31 11:44:17 <funksh0n>	I wish I could suggest a good live distro to you, but since I don't use any I can't, but there are many.
Aug 31 11:44:24 <mystic>	no problem.
Aug 31 11:45:06 <eviladmin>	[oh@Alice][~]% echo ${v/demo2/e}
Aug 31 11:45:08 <eviladmin>	prime-123.png
Aug 31 11:45:10 <cluelessperson>	Is there some sort of repository software that allows you to group and manage groups of git repositories in various fashions?
Aug 31 11:45:13 <cluelessperson>	like, I might want to mirror the same repo for multiple groups
Aug 31 11:45:15 <cluelessperson>	as part of a "cryptography" grouping, and also "python"  and also "sub project"
Aug 31 11:45:43 <funksh0n>	cluelessperson: git branch?
Aug 31 11:45:55 <eviladmin>	lesshaste: you are setting the variable i, but using v
Aug 31 11:46:02 <cluelessperson>	funksh0n   git branches aren't for sorting
Aug 31 11:46:19 <eviladmin>	also, always test with echo :p
Aug 31 11:46:19 <kirk781>	Hello
Aug 31 11:46:20 <cluelessperson>	I mean like, associating a git repo with multiple topics.
Aug 31 11:46:55 <funksh0n>	github has tags and such, other git repo providers probably offer similar.
Aug 31 11:47:09 <eviladmin>	cluelessperson: gitea with some slight modifications
Aug 31 11:47:21 <lesshaste>	eviladmin, thanks!
Aug 31 11:47:40 <cluelessperson>	eviladmin  nice.  I'm currently using gogs.
Aug 31 11:47:43 <cluelessperson>	looks similar
Aug 31 11:47:54 <eviladmin>	gitea is a sanely maintained gogs
Aug 31 11:48:10 <eviladmin>	originally forked from gogs
Aug 31 11:48:18 <cluelessperson>	oh
Aug 31 11:48:47 <eviladmin>	https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/3711
Aug 31 11:49:53 <cluelessperson>	eviladmin  nice.   I was also thinking I want to do more than just "organization" for a git repo
Aug 31 11:50:09 <cluelessperson>	like.    personal/project/repo      public/project/repo   I dunno
Aug 31 11:50:14 <cluelessperson>	topics is a good idea too
Aug 31 11:52:25 <cluelessperson>	eviladmin   I'm about to start building a ton of packages for myself to use generally
Aug 31 11:57:40 <kirk781>	Can xinitrc be manually run?
Aug 31 11:58:17 <funksh0n>	kirk781: you write into .xinitrc and then start it with startx
Aug 31 11:58:51 <funksh0n>	'it' being whatever window manager you have in your .xinitrc
Aug 31 11:58:58 <kirk781>	funksh0n, xinitrc will always be run no matter whatever DE is opened?
Aug 31 11:59:23 <funksh0n>	I don't know, but running startx will launch the stuff in .xinitrc
Aug 31 12:00:01 <funksh0n>	startx and xinitrc are used to launch the wm, not the other way round.
Aug 31 12:00:20 <funksh0n>	as far as I know*
Aug 31 12:00:41 <kirk781>	I put in some commands in xinitrc to autorun on start but they didn't :sigh
Aug 31 12:01:05 <funksh0n>	put your xinitrc onto termbin and share it with us?
Aug 31 12:01:16 <eviladmin>	kirk781: xyproblem
Aug 31 12:01:21 <eviladmin>	kirk781: how are you starting X?
Aug 31 12:01:25 <eviladmin>	kirk781: and which wm/de?
Aug 31 12:02:04 <funksh0n>	kirk781: nc termbin.org 9999 < ~/.xinitrc
Aug 31 12:02:31 <kirk781>	eviladmin, the system boots onto the login screen before launching into Budgie or Xfce[depending watt I choose]
Aug 31 12:02:47 <funksh0n>	you probably shouldn't be editing xinitrc in that case
Aug 31 12:03:02 <kirk781>	If I uninstall the login manager and use startx to start a DE, xinitrc will start ?
Aug 31 12:03:08 <kirk781>	funksh0n, What should I use then?
Aug 31 12:03:19 <funksh0n>	what you just said :)
Aug 31 12:03:38 <funksh0n>	I don't use a wm or de
Aug 31 12:04:46 <funksh0n>	you want some things to run when you turn comp on?  If you've got a login manager, de, whatever.  Depends on your system.
Aug 31 12:04:50 <kirk781>	funksh0n, spend all your time in the terminal environment?
Aug 31 12:05:00 <eviladmin>	kirk781: what login screen
Aug 31 12:05:06 <funksh0n>	if it's debian or similar, systemd
Aug 31 12:05:12 <funksh0n>	yeah I just use tty and tmux
Aug 31 12:05:36 <kirk781>	eviladmin, lighdm, IIRC
Aug 31 12:06:26 <eviladmin>	kirk781: just add the programs to the xfce and/or budgie session manager instead
Aug 31 12:06:29 <funksh0n>	I lobve ttys
Aug 31 12:08:49 <kirk781>	eviladmin, I see. Can terminal commands also be added there?
Aug 31 12:20:21 <eviladmin>	what terminal commands
Aug 31 12:20:35 <eviladmin>	what are you actually trying to do?
Aug 31 12:20:36 <kirk781>	Just xmodmap custom settings
Aug 31 12:21:04 <eviladmin>	don't need to run a terminal command for that
Aug 31 12:21:14 <eviladmin>	also, just what are you changing with xmodmap?
Aug 31 12:21:29 <kirk781>	eviladmin, keymaps
Aug 31 12:21:33 <eviladmin>	what exactly
Aug 31 12:21:51 <kirk781>	eviladmin, there are no permanent modifications. xmodmap reverts to the default settings after each shutdown
Aug 31 12:22:05 <eviladmin>	kirk781: any sane de can merge xmodmap for you
Aug 31 12:22:16 <eviladmin>	but just what exactly are you doing with xmodmap
Aug 31 12:22:37 <kirk781>	eviladmin, just loading a custom file that changes the keymaps for certain keys
Aug 31 12:22:42 <eviladmin>	more often than not a standard layout option can be used instead, other than that making a custom layout is often better
Aug 31 12:23:07 <eviladmin>	like swapping caps with ctrl?
Aug 31 12:23:14 <cluelessperson>	eviladmin  dude, thanks for telling me about gitea, I like it
Aug 31 12:23:42 <kirk781>	eviladmin, you could say that
Aug 31 12:23:58 <eviladmin>	layout option will do that without having to mess with xmodmap
Aug 31 12:25:21 <eviladmin>	grep -E "(ctrl|caps):" /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst
Aug 31 12:27:00 <kirk781>	Ah
Aug 31 12:27:01 <esselfe>	how do I disable a shell builtin in bash?
Aug 31 12:27:16 <eviladmin>	esselfe: why?
Aug 31 12:27:34 <eviladmin>	esselfe: that would make pretty much totally useless
Aug 31 12:27:37 <esselfe>	eviladmin: because my bot is executing it and it shouldn't
Aug 31 12:27:51 <eviladmin>	esselfe: run your bot in a sandbox
Aug 31 12:28:01 <eviladmin>	or better, don't let it run a shell
Aug 31 12:33:22 <smoku>	esselfe: is "rbash" enough for you?
Aug 31 12:33:41 <smoku>	alas "bash -r"
Aug 31 12:34:08 <eviladmin>	smoku: that won't stop people from nuking his machine
Aug 31 12:34:58 <esselfe>	smoku: yes I already use it
Aug 31 12:35:05 <eviladmin>	never mind DoS'ing it
Aug 31 12:35:57 <eviladmin>	there are ready to use sandboxes that stops most common attacks / gotchas
Aug 31 12:36:07 <smoku>	esselfe: so by controlling PATH you pretty much control what can be run by rbash
Aug 31 12:36:14 <eviladmin>	including having watchdogs to prevent DoS
Aug 31 12:40:30 <Nobun>	I need an help with pkg-config... I need to know if:
Aug 31 12:40:53 <Nobun>	1) it is possible to AVOID COMPLETELY that pkg-config will search libraries in default location
Aug 31 12:41:27 <Nobun>	2) if not, if it is possible to force a ./configure to look at a different pkg-config installation (different than the system one)
Aug 31 12:42:04 <Nobun>	reason of question: I am building a mingw toolchain system for compiling windows binaries on linux
Aug 31 12:42:51 <Nobun>	so I need to use "windows" binaries and flags and not linux ones... and if linux available while windows not I would like that pkg-config will not return anything
Aug 31 12:43:45 <rcf>	Nobun: set the PKG_CONFIG, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR  environment variables to reflect the one you actually want to use.
Aug 31 12:44:19 <Nobun>	PKG_CONFIG will add paths... if I remember well
Aug 31 12:44:40 <Nobun>	PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR I will check immediately
Aug 31 12:44:55 <rcf>	PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR will override the existing search paths.
Aug 31 12:45:19 <rcf>	PKG_CONFIG will set which binary you're going to use.
Aug 31 12:45:45 <Nobun>	rcf ok... another question
Aug 31 12:46:09 <Nobun>	it seems (I didn't notice) that PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR could do the trick... or not?
Aug 31 12:46:19 <rcf>	It should.
Aug 31 12:46:19 <Nobun>	I mean... without having to compile and install another binary
Aug 31 12:46:27 <Nobun>	I will make a brief test
Aug 31 12:46:59 <rcf>	If you've got an entirely different pkgconfig installation, of course, you might as well use that binary rather than the system one, to avoid any chance of breakage.
Aug 31 12:47:40 <Nobun>	rcf I still don't have one... I would like to avoid to build pkg-config from source if possible
Aug 31 12:47:53 <rcf>	Ah. IN that case PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR is probably what you want.
Aug 31 12:48:21 <rcf>	If it doesn't work, then you're left with no other option, but if it does you've saved yourself the trouble.
Aug 31 12:48:26 <Nobun>	even if I built the entire mingw and toolchain from sources... but still I could avoid at least one tool xD
Aug 31 12:52:23 <lesshaste>	how do I work out the license for images such as those at https://algocoding.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/union-find-data-structure-disjoint-set-data-structure/ ?
Aug 31 12:52:53 <esselfe>	why does this simple code segfaults? https://termbin.com/ti6s it's just a simple strtok() call, I don't get it
Aug 31 12:54:03 <rcf>	lesshaste: if it's not specified, your only option is to ask the author.
Aug 31 12:54:15 <Nobun>	rcf: yeah it seems working, thank
Aug 31 12:55:05 <lesshaste>	rcf, ok thanks
Aug 31 12:55:10 <rcf>	(or use it anyway and wait until you get legal threats to stop, but that's probably not advisable)
Aug 31 12:56:46 <TheWild>	do you know a way for Firefox to prohibit overriding back button function from JavaScript?
Aug 31 12:56:49 <lesshaste>	rcf,  I won't choose that options :)
Aug 31 12:57:00 <TheWild>	or dunno, maybe GreaseMonkey and I'll fix it myself
Aug 31 12:57:10 <TheWild>	X problem is: YouTube has it broken.
Aug 31 13:00:37 <Pentode>	esselfe: initialize str2 like this: char str2[]="";
Aug 31 13:00:47 <Nobun>	esselfe: try to use "char str2[]=" instead of "char *str2 ="
Aug 31 13:01:10 <Nobun>	Pentode: lol
Aug 31 13:01:34 <Pentode>	i believe in this instance you owe me a coke
Aug 31 13:01:34 <Pentode>	lol
Aug 31 13:02:19 <Nobun>	xD yeah we thinked the same thing in the same time... but I was a bit slower to post it xD
Aug 31 13:02:39 <Pentode>	esselfe: also strtok() works by successively calling the function so for each call it will process the next token and so on
Aug 31 13:03:00 <esselfe>	alright
Aug 31 13:03:13 <rcf>	esselfe: as to why you need to do that, strtok() modifies the string. You aren't allowed to modify a string literal.
Aug 31 13:04:52 <bnado>	Hello, how can I get rid of a process which is in D+ state?
Aug 31 13:05:27 <rcf>	bnado: either fix what is holding up the uinterruptible system call, or reboot.
Aug 31 13:05:45 <rcf>	They are unkillable otherwise.
Aug 31 13:05:55 <simpl_e>	I reconnected my headset and caused the issue
Aug 31 13:06:19 <pingfloyd>	the issue?
Aug 31 13:06:45 <pingfloyd>	is that like "the problem"?
Aug 31 13:06:49 <rcf>	simpl_e: you may want to recap what it is, for those who have recently joined.
Aug 31 13:10:34 <simpl_e>	so, I was listening to music by ffplay and meanwhile I reconnected my headset but it did not continue. Then, I tried to kill the process but it is still in D+ state.
Aug 31 13:12:28 <pingfloyd>	nice coincidence. two different users back to back to trying to kill a D+ state process.
Aug 31 13:17:09 <triceratux>	bwahahaha linux is evil because trump http://techrights.org/2019/08/30/the-exfat-deception/
Aug 31 13:17:18 <triceratux>	that guy is so 70s. linux is evil because ghislaine maxwell
Aug 31 13:19:10 <simpl_e>	rebooting solved my problem anyway :)
Aug 31 13:23:25 <uio>	Hi, I'm installing Debian over Lubuntu on a computer. The Lubuntu has LUKS and I'll be putting it on Debian. If I use the same key on both, do I have to wipe all data during the new install. I'm asking on #debian as well, but no answers yet...
Aug 31 13:24:25 <Wulf>	uio: do you want to wipe your data?
Aug 31 13:24:57 <uio>	Wulf, I want it to disappear.
Aug 31 13:25:15 <uio>	Wulf, If I used a different key I assume it would be inaccessible.
Aug 31 13:25:42 <Wulf>	uio: I assume even with the same password, the data will be deleted.
Aug 31 13:25:55 <Wulf>	uio: debian-installer will most likely create a new filesystem
Aug 31 13:26:12 <uio>	uio, Right, but with the right tools 'deleted' info is still there.
Aug 31 13:26:49 <akik>	uio: it has been encrypted and now if you overwrite, your previous data is gone
Aug 31 13:27:27 <esselfe>	I made it, my bot cannot kill itself anymore!
Aug 31 13:27:45 <uio>	akik, Even if use the same key?
Aug 31 13:28:17 <BluesKaj>	Hi folks
Aug 31 13:28:25 <fanhako>	hey guys, we are live at a linux meetup. Jsut wanna say hi
Aug 31 13:28:26 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, hello
Aug 31 13:28:30 <kirk781>	fanhako, noice
Aug 31 13:28:37 <kirk781>	fanhako, watt are they discussing?
Aug 31 13:28:48 <BluesKaj>	hey kirk781
Aug 31 13:29:10 <fanhako>	we are talking about open source tech and development tools. I am introducing irc to them
Aug 31 13:29:38 <kirk781>	fanhako, lol, I would be surprised if IRC became mainstream again
Aug 31 13:29:42 <uio>	I'll just do the 0 write just in case.
Aug 31 13:29:49 <akik>	uio: if you want to make sure, fill your partition with data once you've reinstalled your system
Aug 31 13:29:51 <uio>	kirk781, That's because it already is!
Aug 31 13:30:08 <uio>	fanhako, How many people are there?
Aug 31 13:30:13 <kirk781>	uio, It's not. Atleast not since fifteen years
Aug 31 13:30:15 <uio>	What OS are you on?
Aug 31 13:30:25 <uio>	kirk781, lol. I know :)
Aug 31 13:30:54 <uio>	akik, Isn't the zero write in the install process simpler?
Aug 31 13:30:56 <kirk781>	uio, Debian based
Aug 31 13:31:16 <uio>	I mean, It'll be long (only at 1%), but I'll eat something maybe.
Aug 31 13:31:18 <akik>	uio: i don't know what zero write you mean
Aug 31 13:31:36 <uio>	akik, Sorry, 'writing random data'
Aug 31 13:31:41 <uio>	kirk781, What one?
Aug 31 13:31:43 <uio>	MX?
Aug 31 13:31:46 <uio>	Antix?
Aug 31 13:31:49 <uio>	Ubuntu?
Aug 31 13:31:56 <uio>	Elementary?
Aug 31 13:32:00 <uio>	Mint?
Aug 31 13:32:22 <BluesKaj>	irc is no longer as popular due to the smartphone, fewer people use pcs or laptops than previous yrs
Aug 31 13:33:06 <kirk781>	uio, Peppermint OS :p
Aug 31 13:33:24 <uio>	kirk781, Cool :)
Aug 31 13:33:25 <xeon>	why linux keeps /proc whereas freebsd deprecates /proc?
Aug 31 13:33:53 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, not really. IRC started losing popularity way before smartphone usage peaked. It also has to do with the popularity of services like Facebook and later, Discord. Slack, effectively replaced IRC in enterprise use
Aug 31 13:33:56 <Wulf>	xeon: I like /proc
Aug 31 13:34:01 <uio>	kirk781, That's LXDE?
Aug 31 13:34:07 <uio>	kirk781, or Cinnamon?
Aug 31 13:34:11 <kirk781>	uio, It is Xfce based by default
Aug 31 13:34:19 <kirk781>	uio, I am currently running Budgie on it
Aug 31 13:34:24 <uio>	kirk781, Cool.
Aug 31 13:34:31 <kirk781>	I used Cinnamon back in the day. It was good
Aug 31 13:34:42 <kirk781>	Honestly, as long as something is not KDE, it's fine
Aug 31 13:34:54 <uio>	kirk781, lol
Aug 31 13:35:29 <kirk781>	uio, I installed KDE Neon for some reason and decided to use Xfce on it
Aug 31 13:35:31 <BluesKaj>	kirk781, hmm, I've been on irc for 20yrs. haven't really noticed much change because dedicated irc users seem to stick around
Aug 31 13:35:57 <uio>	...4%...
Aug 31 13:35:57 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, IRC usage peaked sixteen years ago, IIRC and Freenode and Snoonet are the only couple of networks really thriving these days
Aug 31 13:36:17 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, I ran into a guy here who remembered Eternal September :p
Aug 31 13:36:32 <roboirc>	sup kirk781
Aug 31 13:36:38 <kirk781>	roboirc, hello
Aug 31 13:36:55 <kirk781>	Ah yes, I forget that roboirc is also a fellow Indian :p
Aug 31 13:37:12 <roboirc>	yes :D
Aug 31 13:37:16 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, Have you been to Undernet? Does it still exist?
Aug 31 13:37:24 <roboirc>	yes Undernet exists
Aug 31 13:37:32 <roboirc>	tho it sux cuz has no network services
Aug 31 13:37:39 <BluesKaj>	dunno, I haven't checked
Aug 31 13:37:45 <kirk781>	roboirc, for some reason, whenever I try to connect to it, it never does
Aug 31 13:38:07 <roboirc>	kirk781: make sure ur username is short, sometimes if its not it goes bonkers
Aug 31 13:38:10 <roboirc>	try eu.undernet.org
Aug 31 13:38:11 <roboirc>	good server
Aug 31 13:38:25 <BluesKaj>	kirk781, http://www.undernet.org/
Aug 31 13:38:57 <roboirc>	yeah their site is not well maintained
Aug 31 13:39:39 <BluesKaj>	dalnet is still around too
Aug 31 13:39:57 <roboirc>	yeah
Aug 31 13:40:31 <kirk781>	All i get is error smiley codes when trying the webchat and Hexchat purely fails to connect
Aug 31 13:41:30 <BluesKaj>	https://netsplit.de/networks/top100.php
Aug 31 13:41:33 <roboirc>	hexchat sux
Aug 31 13:41:36 <roboirc>	what platform u on?
Aug 31 13:41:46 <kirk781>	roboirc, Linux
Aug 31 13:41:57 <roboirc>	kirk781:  try kvirc
Aug 31 13:43:37 <warrian>	asking here since #solaris is hibernating
Aug 31 13:43:53 <warrian>	I have basically 0 experience with solaris - does the OS have a startup vs running configuration? do you have to commit changes that would otherwise be lost after a reboot?
Aug 31 13:44:10 <BluesKaj>	kirk781, which DE?
Aug 31 13:44:19 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, Budgie currently
Aug 31 13:44:36 <kirk781>	Undernet is dead, I guess. See their forum section, no posts for five years
Aug 31 13:44:41 <BluesKaj>	does it have a default irc client?
Aug 31 13:45:22 <kirk781>	BluesKaj, Nope
Aug 31 13:46:12 <roboirc>	kirk781:  but their network is still active
Aug 31 13:46:26 <kirk781>	roboirc, are you able to connect?
Aug 31 13:46:48 <roboirc>	yes
Aug 31 13:47:01 <BluesKaj>	I'm a KDE/Plasma user and good ol' Konversation fits the bill here
Aug 31 13:47:23 <roboirc>	kirk781: try this server: pipera.ro.eu.undernet.org
Aug 31 13:47:25 <roboirc>	im on that one
Aug 31 13:50:32 <iflema>	warrian eh
Aug 31 13:50:33 <esselfe>	undernet has a nice #mp3download channel, elsewise, I don't see which channel are worth joining
Aug 31 13:55:19 <warrian>	iflema: ?
Aug 31 13:56:48 <iflema>	warrian headless? I wanna say startup...
Aug 31 13:57:00 <iflema>	its been a while
Aug 31 13:57:55 <roboirc>	kirk781: type this in hexchat inputbox: /server pipera.ro.eu.undernet.org
Aug 31 13:57:57 <roboirc>	should work fine
Aug 31 13:58:48 <kirk781>	roboirc, I tried it. Doesn't work. Possibly due to the fact that I am behind proxy
Aug 31 13:58:57 <roboirc>	probably
Aug 31 13:59:17 <roboirc>	behind university internet or something?
Aug 31 13:59:58 <kirk781>	roboirc, yes
Aug 31 14:00:10 <roboirc>	try kiwiirc then
Aug 31 14:00:14 <roboirc>	thats http based
Aug 31 14:00:16 <kirk781>	I have properly configured proxy setting and other IRC networks work fine
Aug 31 14:00:21 <kirk781>	roboirc, I just installed it :p
Aug 31 14:06:37 <friendlyGoat>	is anyone awake at all? i need help with something that should not of taken this long to deal with but has wound up absorbing over an hour of my time
Aug 31 14:07:07 <akik>	friendlyGoat: write about your problem. maybe somebody can help
Aug 31 14:07:07 <redsh>	Just asking is quicker.
Aug 31 14:07:51 *	iflema fire at wil cimmander
Aug 31 14:08:40 <friendlyGoat>	for some god forsaken reason no matter what grub will not display my new background image for it, it displayed my last one well so i have no idea what the deal is. i've been trapped in a sysiphean hell loop for an hour with no progress. this sound like a total nooby question but im really tired and i cant rest until im done working on whatever my horrible brain has focused on and this is what its zoned in on this morning.
Aug 31 14:08:45 <friendlyGoat>	pardon my slight ranting with it
Aug 31 14:09:17 <friendlyGoat>	for more information i have Grub Customizer which has a little thing for adjusting the grub menus appearence and everything but for some reason it just wont work
Aug 31 14:09:33 <triceratux>	give up. use the old image
Aug 31 14:10:06 <friendlyGoat>	honestly tempting
Aug 31 14:11:05 <triceratux>	2nd guess: use an image editor to make a version of the new image that has the same graphical specs as the old image
Aug 31 14:11:15 *	triceratux always starts with something he knows works
Aug 31 14:12:13 <BluesKaj>	friendlyGoat, customizsers for grub are clunky and bug ridden IME
Aug 31 14:12:20 <roboirc>	kirk781: u try kiwiirc yet?
Aug 31 14:12:40 <kirk781>	KVIrc is mucking up for me on a diff. level. Despite making a connection with the proxy server successfully, it is failing to connect with even Freenode
Aug 31 14:12:59 <roboirc>	works on mine thats what im using atm
Aug 31 14:13:00 <roboirc>	:P
Aug 31 14:13:30 <iflema>	grub splash is .spx or somesuch
Aug 31 14:13:52 <friendlyGoat>	yeeah i probably put too much hope into grub customizer, and im trying out triceratux's idea right now
Aug 31 14:13:53 <BluesKaj>	socks 5 proxy settings work well on hexchat if you really need a proxy
Aug 31 14:14:18 <kirk781>	KVirc gets a local host address from the IRC server only to end the connection
Aug 31 14:19:11 *	esselfe waits for random people to run random commands on my system using my bot... wanna try?
Aug 31 14:19:22 <roboirc>	sure esselfe
Aug 31 14:20:18 <roboirc>	link?
Aug 31 14:20:44 <kirk781>	Why does the damn connection time out for me all the time
Aug 31 14:20:58 <roboirc>	sounds like a connection problem
Aug 31 14:21:00 <roboirc>	proxy
Aug 31 14:21:21 <kirk781>	I have set it there and even double checked it
Aug 31 14:24:20 <ThothCastel>	sudo apt-get install net-tools
Aug 31 14:24:32 <ThothCastel>	I am trying to install net-tools on ubuntu client
Aug 31 14:24:35 <ThothCastel>	new installation
Aug 31 14:25:23 <ThothCastel>	it keeps on saying that the package isn't available for download
Aug 31 14:25:27 <ThothCastel>	?
Aug 31 14:25:47 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, what version of ubuntu
Aug 31 14:26:10 <ThothCastel>	Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
Aug 31 14:27:44 <omero>	hey folks, a (good) friend the other day donated me a brand-new-old Fujitsu E8410, with wich I'm toying a bit with 'porteus'... main internal disk is 120Gb and comes with Solaris-XX (cant remember, probably 10)...
Aug 31 14:27:58 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, well it is in the repos, can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
Aug 31 14:28:31 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, and just in case do an update first " sudo apt update "
Aug 31 14:28:41 <omero>	Im booting with porteus on a usb-stick, works almost 100% but I'd like to transfer that on the internal HDD
Aug 31 14:29:36 <Merc>	weiners
Aug 31 14:29:37 <omero>	now, my inner voice tells me to make an image of the HDD before wiping it and repartition with ext3 (ext4?)...
Aug 31 14:30:03 <rcf>	Only if you care about the contents.
Aug 31 14:30:03 <triceratux>	omero: congrats. did you get the kernel panics to go away ?
Aug 31 14:30:28 <omero>	oh triceratux ... no, not yet... I have dmesg logs saved though
Aug 31 14:30:53 <uio>	39%... so SLOW!
Aug 31 14:31:23 <omero>	theyre not kernel panics, they some modules probably... I could show a snippet of one
Aug 31 14:32:01 <Merc>	take a tip from Windows... keep your data in directories on a drive, hung off ~ .. ~/Documents, ~/Pictures, ~/Videos, ~/Downloads, ~/Music
Aug 31 14:32:19 <Merc>	that way you can wipe your OS as many times as you need to, and your data is always secure
Aug 31 14:32:26 <Merc>	makes backups easy
Aug 31 14:32:35 <akik>	GRUB_BACKGROUND="/boot/grub2/splash.png" and commenting #GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console" was all that i needed on fedora 29
Aug 31 14:33:07 <akik>	vi is my grub customizer
Aug 31 14:33:08 <triceratux>	omero: ah. well moving porteus from one device to another is trivial. make an ext4 partition & copy the /porteus directory from the flashdrive. then rename /porteus on the flashdrive so its not found at boottime. i even keep the bootloader / kernel / initrd on the flashdrive & keep booting from there
Aug 31 14:33:14 <omero>	I was thinking something like this: dd if=/dev/sda | gzip -1 - | ssh user@local dd of=image.gz
Aug 31 14:33:26 <Merc>	no reason to backup the entire drive
Aug 31 14:33:36 <iflema>	basically - boot the USB in single user, cp -a to DEST and check fstab and grub. Hows / layed out omero all in one partition?
Aug 31 14:34:04 <triceratux>	omero: definitely post the logs if you get a chance
Aug 31 14:34:17 <omero>	I want to preserve that solaris as an image, possibly for some funny other day
Aug 31 14:34:43 <Merc>	once again, finding a solaris install image is easy
Aug 31 14:34:45 <iflema>	more solaris
Aug 31 14:34:51 <Merc>	back up your personal data
Aug 31 14:34:53 <Merc>	forget the rest
Aug 31 14:35:04 <omero>	the internal HDD is currently not in use, thus I think singleuser mode isnt really necessary
Aug 31 14:35:26 <iflema>	not linux
Aug 31 14:35:39 <omero>	Merc: this is a custom solaris, that's why I want to preserve it
Aug 31 14:35:49 <Merc>	what do you mean by "custom solaris"?
Aug 31 14:35:52 <ThothCastel>	Mathisen:
Aug 31 14:35:55 <ThothCastel>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/TjYZ2dvc/
Aug 31 14:36:37 <omero>	and yes, Merc its just one wholedisk partition
Aug 31 14:37:20 <Merc>	i dunno how many times i can type the same thing: keep your data in well-defined, organized partitions
Aug 31 14:37:32 <uio>	Backups are so overrated.
Aug 31 14:37:33 <Merc>	keep your OS apart from your data
Aug 31 14:37:33 <omero>	but I was thinking /dev/sda, instead of /dev/sda1... there could be some hidden diagnostics in there... not sure
Aug 31 14:37:49 <Merc>	then it doesnt matter what OS you choose to install...windows, linux, solaris, BSD, etc etc etc
Aug 31 14:37:50 <compdoc>	10,003 and counting
Aug 31 14:37:57 <uio>	I think more time is wasted backingup data than would be if no one backed up data.
Aug 31 14:38:01 <Merc>	they can all mount your data drives
Aug 31 14:38:12 <uio>	It sucks for one person, but collectively a waste of time.
Aug 31 14:38:16 <kirk781>	roboirc, I finally got KiviIRC to connect
Aug 31 14:38:37 <kirk781>	roboirc, Apparently,I had to manually change the default port to support for SSL connections

Aug 31 14:41:04 *	uio tells Merc to read the irc intro
Aug 31 14:41:15 <ThothCastel>	Mathisen: thank you that owrked
Aug 31 14:41:35 <Merc>	<uio> I think more time is wasted backingup data than would be if no one backed up data.  <-- why would i listen to anything this person said
Aug 31 14:41:38 <Merc>	;-)
Aug 31 14:42:04 <roboirc>	Merc use pastebin please not pasting it here!
Aug 31 14:42:05 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, you just have forgoten to update then.
Aug 31 14:42:06 <Merc>	before giving advice, get your head straight
Aug 31 14:42:12 <Merc>	roboirc: shuttup
Aug 31 14:42:21 <ThothCastel>	Mathisen: I am trying to install VMWare tools on this newly installed ubuntu desktop with minimum hardware requirements - I am unable to uncompress the tar file as it seems that 'there isn't snough space'
Aug 31 14:42:23 <Merc>	time for some fallout76
Aug 31 14:42:24 <Merc>	OOH YEAH
Aug 31 14:42:28 *	Merc wanders off
Aug 31 14:42:33 <roboirc>	ok..
Aug 31 14:42:38 *	roboirc slaps Merc around with a large trout
Aug 31 14:42:44 <ThothCastel>	but it is a 25GB hard drive
Aug 31 14:43:02 <compdoc>	how much space is free?
Aug 31 14:43:08 <ThothCastel>	when I installed the ubuntu, I chose to encrypt the drive
Aug 31 14:43:15 <ThothCastel>	could that have been the issue?
Aug 31 14:43:18 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, run " df "
Aug 31 14:43:18 <eviladmin>	no
Aug 31 14:43:21 <ThothCastel>	that would be stupid if so
Aug 31 14:43:29 <eviladmin>	you allocating way too little space on tehr other hand
Aug 31 14:43:36 <eviladmin>	also, it might be trying to use /tmp
Aug 31 14:43:42 <eviladmin>	findmnt -T /tmp
Aug 31 14:43:56 <eviladmin>	also, why not use the open tools instead?
Aug 31 14:43:58 <ThothCastel>	Mathisen: strange
Aug 31 14:44:24 <ThothCastel>	it is showing as /dev/sda1 having only 704M
Aug 31 14:44:36 <Mathisen>	then you have messed upp during install
Aug 31 14:44:37 <ThothCastel>	which is the boot option
Aug 31 14:44:52 <ThothCastel>	It might have been the encryption option :S
Aug 31 14:45:23 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: encryption does not affect this
Aug 31 14:45:38 <uio>	Merc, Think about it though: we all waste so much time backing up stuff. If no one backuped data, less time would be wasted by humanity.
Aug 31 14:45:44 <eviladmin>	you installing to the wrong disk on the other hand
Aug 31 14:45:50 <eviladmin>	disk/partition :p
Aug 31 14:46:00 <omero>	triceratux, https://termbin.com/opqee
Aug 31 14:46:29 <omero>	that's the 1st occurrence, there are more
Aug 31 14:46:50 <omero>	different things, not same as above
Aug 31 14:48:48 <triceratux>	omero: thanks. it does that a few dozen times into the console at boot & then continues the startup ?
Aug 31 14:49:35 <omero>	triceratux, precisely... but this means that the system takes looong to get into X
Aug 31 14:49:48 *	triceratux googles furiously for flip_done timed out
Aug 31 14:50:48 <triceratux>	hrm boot very slow because of drm helpers. youre lucky you get a log :)
Aug 31 14:51:37 <Barones>	Hi, Do I need a cpanel to manage a wordpress blog?
Aug 31 14:52:22 <Mathisen>	no
Aug 31 14:53:08 <triceratux>	omero: its the chipset. there will be stuff to try like these https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1685442/comments/30
Aug 31 14:53:15 <Mathisen>	Barones, if you gonna self host it all you need is a web server + sql server with php support thats all
Aug 31 14:53:35 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: I am now going through the installation of ubuntu again
Aug 31 14:53:40 <longxia>	ThothCastel: looking at my ubuntu 18.04.03 I have /boot on sda2. sda1 = 1M, sda2 = 1G. Which sd is mounted on /?
Aug 31 14:53:45 <omero>	ah! ok, will look that up, thanks triceratux
Aug 31 14:53:52 <ThothCastel>	when I chose 'Encryption, it does not allow me to unselect the LVM part
Aug 31 14:54:07 <ThothCastel>	besides it does not ask me which HDD to use
Aug 31 14:54:15 <paulcarroty>	lvm is a waste of time now
Aug 31 14:54:29 <ThothCastel>	it simply creates 2 partitions, swap and other
Aug 31 14:54:35 <triceratux>	omero: therell be something you can put on the bootloader line to get those drm modules to calm down. looks like theyve been running into it for a few years
Aug 31 14:55:27 <omero>	Ill check the other errors too, then
Aug 31 14:55:52 <omero>	Im reading the SVideo-1
Aug 31 14:56:24 <ThothCastel>	paulcarroty: why?
Aug 31 14:56:32 <ThothCastel>	why is LVM a waste of time?
Aug 31 14:56:35 <triceratux>	omero: look thru the whole thread. much gnashing of teeth :) https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1685442
Aug 31 14:56:40 <mystic>	LVM?  love or money?
Aug 31 14:56:50 <omero>	rotfl
Aug 31 14:57:00 <mystic>	I'm here but working.. so no complaints from me for now
Aug 31 14:58:30 <Barones>	I'm going host it Mathisen , cool, great, cpanel would be one more learning curve to try to write about network/tech, any theme in wordpress good that??
Aug 31 14:58:46 <paulcarroty>	ThothCastel, modern fs does the same job out the box
Aug 31 14:58:51 <omero>	I dont see any SVideo connectors on this relic either, I'll start with that
Aug 31 14:59:13 <omero>	but of course I'll postpone untill I've stabilized on internal HDD
Aug 31 14:59:26 <ThothCastel>	paulcarroty: my intention is just to encrypt the drive upon installation
Aug 31 14:59:36 <ThothCastel>	but it seems that LVM is compulsory if I encrypt it
Aug 31 14:59:38 <ThothCastel>	?
Aug 31 14:59:53 <paulcarroty>	Barones, cpanel designed for stupid people which love 'do it in one click'
Aug 31 15:00:24 <Mathisen>	Barones, go to #wordpress channel for general theme and such questions. i have no idea myself. im a joomla user not wordpress
Aug 31 15:00:27 <paulcarroty>	ThothCastel, LVM isn't related to encryption by design.
Aug 31 15:01:22 <paulcarroty>	wordpress is easy to install/upgrade without any panels, zero skills needed
Aug 31 15:01:26 <ThothCastel>	paulcarroty: if one goes through the basic installation of ubuntu desktop (latest supported version from ubuntu site), and choses encryption, the LVM tick box is simply compulsory - so, how do you mean it is not related?
Aug 31 15:01:36 <ThothCastel>	please elaborate
Aug 31 15:02:51 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: lvm is not a waste of time
Aug 31 15:03:06 <eviladmin>	btw, you can do manual partitioning if you prefer
Aug 31 15:03:19 <uio>	...59%...
Aug 31 15:03:22 <paulcarroty>	ThothCastel, LVM - volume management only. You can encrypt partition(s) without LVM.
Aug 31 15:03:45 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: are you just playing around in a vm?
Aug 31 15:04:06 <eviladmin>	if so, just hook off for encryption and use single partition and then click next a bunch of times, done
Aug 31 15:04:41 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: yes - VMware workstation
Aug 31 15:05:14 <Barones>	paulcarroty, I think the same, I really prefer do it by hand handle it with cpanel
Aug 31 15:05:24 <ThothCastel>	my objective is to install with encrypttion but when done, I don't see my 25GB drive under df command - instead I see 700MB
Aug 31 15:06:03 <ThothCastel>	so it appears that the only way is to install without encryption
Aug 31 15:06:13 <eviladmin>	no
Aug 31 15:06:15 <ThothCastel>	and then look into encrypting it later after the installation is complete?
Aug 31 15:06:19 <eviladmin>	no
Aug 31 15:06:20 <paulcarroty>	ThothCastel, just use their manual, can't remember when installed ubuntu last time
Aug 31 15:06:32 <eviladmin>	post the full df output
Aug 31 15:06:35 <eviladmin>	df -h even
Aug 31 15:06:48 <ThothCastel>	well I need to re-install it first
Aug 31 15:06:53 <ThothCastel>	will do it in a bit
Aug 31 15:06:55 <paulcarroty>	stop
Aug 31 15:07:30 <paulcarroty>	better fix your problems without reinstall
Aug 31 15:07:31 <eviladmin>	do tell it to just make a single large partition instead of splitting out /home and /var etc
Aug 31 15:07:43 <eviladmin>	sounds like he already nuked it?
Aug 31 15:08:15 <eviladmin>	and really use the open-vm-tools, ubuntu should ship them
Aug 31 15:08:24 <eviladmin>	instead of using the broken vmware tools installer
Aug 31 15:08:50 <ThothCastel>	guys, as I said , I haven't done anything in addition to
Aug 31 15:08:51 <ThothCastel>	1 - Basic install with encryption of ubuntu client
Aug 31 15:08:57 <ThothCastel>	no nikuning
Aug 31 15:09:02 <ThothCastel>	no changes of configurations
Aug 31 15:09:04 <ThothCastel>	nothing
Aug 31 15:09:07 <ThothCastel>	all else default
Aug 31 15:09:26 <eviladmin>	it asked you with a multiple choice question if you wanted a single partition or not
Aug 31 15:10:01 <ThothCastel>	then when trying to install vmware tools, I am unable because it can't uncompress the mounted vmware tools because it hasn't got enough space
Aug 31 15:10:04 <paulcarroty>	single partition is good only for btrfs/zfs
Aug 31 15:10:08 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: no, it didn't
Aug 31 15:10:23 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: it did, I ran trough the installer just yesterday
Aug 31 15:10:42 <eviladmin>	paulcarroty: not really
Aug 31 15:10:44 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: it didn't I am just running through it now
Aug 31 15:10:51 <eviladmin>	paulcarroty: specially not when you have only 25gb to play with
Aug 31 15:10:55 <ThothCastel>	it does only if one choses 'custom' install
Aug 31 15:20:44 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin:
Aug 31 15:20:50 <ThothCastel>	output of df -h
Aug 31 15:20:51 <ThothCastel>	https://pastebin.com/feaEg1ta
Aug 31 15:21:23 <FMan>	Ubuntu and I could not find it in the man page
Aug 31 15:21:25 <ThothCastel>	we see that the the sda1 is the boot
Aug 31 15:21:43 <ThothCastel>	but I understand sd5 is where the other partition (data) is meant to be available
Aug 31 15:21:48 <ThothCastel>	but I don't see it there
Aug 31 15:22:05 <ThothCastel>	I might be able to create a sda5 partition with 'possible blank space'?
Aug 31 15:22:38 <eviladmin>	what blank space
Aug 31 15:23:08 <eviladmin>	your / is 23gb
Aug 31 15:23:10 <FMan>	what was the command for apt-get, eviladmin?
Aug 31 15:23:11 <longxia>	ThothCastel: can you also paste 'lsblk' output (preferably using paste.linux.community, see topic)?
Aug 31 15:23:17 <eviladmin>	the rest is used for swap and boot
Aug 31 15:23:39 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: findmnt -T /tmp
Aug 31 15:24:08 <ThothCastel>	longxia:
Aug 31 15:24:11 <ThothCastel>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/zjgVYoCx/
Aug 31 15:25:21 <ThothCastel>	longxia: https://paste.linux.community/view/83fbf434
Aug 31 15:27:00 <longxia>	ThothCastel: ok, so almost all of your 25G is taken by the root volume which still has 18G free.
Aug 31 15:27:55 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: what did findmnt say?
Aug 31 15:29:02 <mystic>	the holy firmament
Aug 31 15:29:34 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: https://paste.linux.community/view/7a2fbef4
Aug 31 15:30:19 <eviladmin>	you forgot the -T /tmp
Aug 31 15:31:00 <eviladmin>	doesn't seem like /tmp is on a tmpfs though
Aug 31 15:31:31 <eviladmin>	though maybe the vmware tools tries to use a tmpfs for it
Aug 31 15:31:47 <eviladmin>	also, how much ram?
Aug 31 15:32:40 <uio>	anyone here use ring / jami ?
Aug 31 15:32:42 <longxia>	ThothCastel: looks like you were in /boot when you tried to unpack the VMWare tools. That mount has 700M free, which you mentioned earlier. Why not cd /home/you/tmp and unpack there?
Aug 31 15:33:57 <ThothCastel>	longxia: that makes sense
Aug 31 15:35:01 <ThothCastel>	longxia: it seems that extracting into my home/desktop is not working
Aug 31 15:35:28 <ThothCastel>	it is weird because it appears my home directory is inide the 'boot' partition (700MB)?
Aug 31 15:36:05 <longxia>	ThothCastel: that would be unusual
Aug 31 15:37:00 <ThothCastel>	it looks to me that the 'encryption' at the installation process, creates it in a very unusual way
Aug 31 15:37:14 <ThothCastel>	it forces you to combine with LVM
Aug 31 15:37:37 <omero>	triceratux, I lied... now that I've a clue at what to look, the traces all point to that CONNECTOR:50:SVIDEO-1
Aug 31 15:38:49 <Gustavo6046>	Does swapping transfer older memory from RAM?
Aug 31 15:39:45 <longxia>	ThothCastel: i don't have an encrypted fs on ubuntu lying around to use as a reference, so I find it difficult to advise on this. But you're free to create a new dir on /, one that doesn't exist already and unpack there. But I'm not familiar with these VMWare tools so it don't know if any location is good enough for them to run. Maybe someone else can help you with that.
Aug 31 15:39:59 <esselfe>	Gustavo6046: once memoery is swapped it tends to remain there until the pages are requested
Aug 31 15:40:16 <Gustavo6046>	Ah.
Aug 31 15:40:25 <Gustavo6046>	Yeah, but, does it swap old memory or newer memory?
Aug 31 15:40:40 <esselfe>	it swaps unused pages
Aug 31 15:40:52 <esselfe>	so old memory
Aug 31 15:41:04 <eviladmin>	no
Aug 31 15:41:10 <eviladmin>	unused doesn't mean old
Aug 31 15:42:20 <Gustavo6046>	Old as in memory that hasn't been written to or read from in a while.
Aug 31 15:42:20 <eviladmin>	unused just means unused, it might have been allocated and dropped just 5ns ago
Aug 31 15:42:27 <Gustavo6046>	I don't know how to define this while.
Aug 31 15:42:38 <eviladmin>	or it mught have happened two weeks ago
Aug 31 15:42:54 <ThothCastel>	under the root, I see
Aug 31 15:43:13 <ThothCastel>	'/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root
Aug 31 15:43:26 <ThothCastel>	that is where I see the 23G availalbe
Aug 31 15:43:47 <Mathisen>	then you have plenty of space
Aug 31 15:43:52 <FMan>	ok, I found the answer on the Internet
Aug 31 15:44:05 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: nowhere does it say that your $HOME is inside /boot
Aug 31 15:44:12 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, mind backing upp a bit. have you downloaded a .tar file or install vmware from repos ?
Aug 31 15:44:50 <eviladmin>	Mathisen: he is trying to use the .iso vmware provides to install the guest addons
Aug 31 15:44:55 <eviladmin>	which is a terrible way to do it
Aug 31 15:45:51 <Mathisen>	not terrible but not needed no.
Aug 31 15:45:59 <eviladmin>	it is objectively terrible
Aug 31 15:46:09 <mystic>	why
Aug 31 15:46:34 <eviladmin>	1. no tracking trough the package manager 2. is makes wrong assumptions about your system
Aug 31 15:46:53 <triceratux>	omero: hrm the archniks spotted it as a bug the moment it happened https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=218581
Aug 31 15:46:54 <mystic>	you are makng assumptions i understand what you mean
Aug 31 15:47:03 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, just run > sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop
Aug 31 15:47:22 <Mathisen>	ThothCastel, and you need a reboot after.
Aug 31 15:47:26 *	eviladmin did suggest the open tools but got no response
Aug 31 15:48:43 <triceratux>	omero: the mint folks go so far as to disable the intel drivers https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=273797 everything is supposed to be running modesetting these days
Aug 31 15:49:07 <omero>	interesting
Aug 31 15:49:33 <omero>	means I have to rebuild the kernel then...
Aug 31 15:49:59 <eviladmin>	you could just blacklist the module
Aug 31 15:50:16 <eviladmin>	or just not install xf86-video-intel
Aug 31 15:50:34 <eviladmin>	it is the ddx driver they talking about, not the kernel driver
Aug 31 15:51:02 <omero>	mmm... good point, yes yes..gotcha eviladmin
Aug 31 15:51:17 <eviladmin>	when talking about modesetting vs intel that is
Aug 31 15:52:13 <omero>	I find it weird that the bug still appears... seems a thing of like 2-3 years now
Aug 31 15:52:31 <eviladmin>	intel better start actually maintaining their driver for when they release Xe
Aug 31 15:52:54 <eviladmin>	omero: intel have let xf86-video-intel rot for almost a decade now
Aug 31 15:53:00 <omero>	 truthfully hope this bug gets squashed with 4.9
Aug 31 15:53:11 <omero>	lol, that was one of the comments
Aug 31 15:53:16 <eviladmin>	kernel 4.9? that have been out for a year almost
Aug 31 15:53:18 <mystic>	i threw a bug out my room other day and it came back in about 4 times
Aug 31 15:53:49 <eviladmin>	er.. three years*
Aug 31 15:56:08 <triceratux>	omero: recent versions of xorg prefer modesetting over intel. intel may not load that often anymore https://tjaalton.wordpress.com/2016/07/23/intel-graphics-gen4-and-newer-now-defaults-to-modesetting-driver-on-x/
Aug 31 15:56:40 <mystic>	molesting the borg over intel
Aug 31 15:56:40 <eviladmin>	xorg will still pick intel if it is installed
Aug 31 15:56:49 <ThothCastel>	Mathisen: thank you that apt install command was so much more straight forward - installing now
Aug 31 15:57:26 <eviladmin>	not that the open tools are not the same as the non-free vmware tools
Aug 31 15:57:32 <eviladmin>	that said, they usually work better anyway
Aug 31 15:57:37 <ThothCastel>	could this issue I had with partitions have happened because I chose VMware to create various HDD instead of a single file?
Aug 31 16:00:32 <triceratux>	eviladmin: ive got that link because i saw all the distros become modesetting preferential. intel is loaded on endeavouros & its the first time ive seen that in a couple years
Aug 31 16:01:27 <triceratux>	most of them like modesetting so much they cant be put in vesa mode & wont boot if you say nomodeset
Aug 31 16:01:54 <eviladmin>	no, that is not the reason
Aug 31 16:02:23 <eviladmin>	both intel, ati and amdgpu requires modesetting
Aug 31 16:02:29 <eviladmin>	kms that is
Aug 31 16:04:04 <triceratux>	eviladmin: yep so you cant say nomodeset to the bootloader anymore because it shuts down kms in the kernel
Aug 31 16:04:19 <triceratux>	so modesetting became the standard
Aug 31 16:04:20 <eviladmin>	obviously
Aug 31 16:04:36 <eviladmin>	not really the standard, there is no standard
Aug 31 16:05:03 <eviladmin>	not since the refactor of Xorg into a modular design
Aug 31 16:05:07 <triceratux>	im saying, when xorg comes along without nomodeset specified it now ignores intel in the general case
Aug 31 16:05:18 <eviladmin>	no?
Aug 31 16:05:38 <eviladmin>	the intel ddx driver requires kms, so it can't work without kms
Aug 31 16:05:42 <eviladmin>	it is not randomly ignoring it
Aug 31 16:05:50 <Nobun>	another help: http://dpaste.com/3Y4KWTC
Aug 31 16:06:16 <Nobun>	I expected this VARIABLE should be seen as an array but only the first value seems cached
Aug 31 16:06:22 <eviladmin>	Nobun: "$c"
Aug 31 16:06:29 <eviladmin>	always quote variables
Aug 31 16:06:30 <Gustavo6046>	So I defined a storage device (guest sdb) as sharaeble in virt-manager. How do I access it from the host machine?
Aug 31 16:07:00 <eviladmin>	depends on what you mean by "sharable
Aug 31 16:07:02 <eviladmin>	"
Aug 31 16:07:22 <eviladmin>	using virtio-p9? samba? nfs? mounted as a raw volume?
Aug 31 16:07:26 <Nobun>	eviladmin: thank. however even if I say echo "$c" the same issue
Aug 31 16:07:34 <Nobun>	the problem is the array
Aug 31 16:07:38 <Nobun>	and I don't get why
Aug 31 16:07:40 <Gustavo6046>	That's the thing. There is a "shareable" checkbox in the storage settings.
Aug 31 16:07:53 <triceratux>	eviladmin: ill take your word for it. i keep a pretty good eye on it ;)
Aug 31 16:07:56 <eviladmin>	Nobun: correct, but you won't end up with https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/issues/123
Aug 31 16:08:07 <mgolisch>	Gustavo6046: its meant to allow multiple vms to use the same disk

Aug 31 16:11:08 *	triceratux suddenly wonders if his nomodeset boots have been blackscreening over drm timeouts
Aug 31 16:11:26 <triceratux>	its true i wont wait 4-5 minutes for x11 to start like in some of the posts rofl
Aug 31 16:11:53 <eviladmin>	Nobun: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Arrays
Aug 31 16:12:34 <eviladmin>	you can simply use printf if you want to print the content too
Aug 31 16:12:34 <omero>	I cant remember why but at some poin in time, had to forfait kms
Aug 31 16:13:12 <eviladmin>	I asume you are doing something else than printing it though
Aug 31 16:13:53 <oneliner>	hello there, I would like to know if its possible to use rsync to sync from a remote (linux) to a local destination(windows) using mingw64 using public keys for server access
Aug 31 16:13:55 <triceratux>	i do remember why, & recently i had to abandon nomodeset :)
Aug 31 16:14:49 <eviladmin>	because you didn't know of video= ?
Aug 31 16:15:01 <eviladmin>	:p
Aug 31 16:15:34 <Nobun>	eviladmin: I can't get your suggestion... I am already using the    "The easiest way to create a simple array with data is by using the =() syntax: "
Aug 31 16:15:46 <Nobun>	if you see my source it is what I am doing
Aug 31 16:15:53 <eviladmin>	Nobun: scroll down: "using the array"
Aug 31 16:15:56 <Mathisen>	oneliner, you can use rsync from linux to windows yes. depending on windows there is even native open-ssh client
Aug 31 16:15:58 <omero>	bhuahua, eviladmin 'au contraire' but cant remember the exact reason
Aug 31 16:16:15 <eviladmin>	Nobun: or rather "Using Arrays"
Aug 31 16:16:15 <triceratux>	eviladmin: certainly not. video= isnt universally supported. if they want me running modesetting so be it
Aug 31 16:16:33 <eviladmin>	triceratux: video is universally supported
Aug 31 16:16:51 <eviladmin>	if kms is enabled, video will work
Aug 31 16:16:58 <triceratux>	pfft
Aug 31 16:17:26 <triceratux>	eviladmin: ill start googling. i always wanted to fix this
Aug 31 16:17:35 <oneliner>	Mathisen I have peageant for handling keys but i cant seem to find an option to point rsync to use it, i wonder if i could do it backwards, ergo login to the remote and try to sync from there?
Aug 31 16:18:18 <mgolisch>	it probably only supports openssh
Aug 31 16:18:22 <Nobun>	thank eviladmin
Aug 31 16:18:28 <eviladmin>	"The syntax "${myfiles[@]}" is extremely important. It works just like "$@" does for the positional parameters: it expands to a list of words, with each array element as one word, no matter what it contains. Even if there are spaces, tabs, newlines, quotation marks, or any other kind of characters in one of the array elements, it'll still be passed along as one word to whichever command we're
Aug 31 16:18:29 <eviladmin>	running. "
Aug 31 16:18:33 <oneliner>	I tried with pcsp but besides taking a full day it choked on a private file so i cant tell if did it right
Aug 31 16:18:36 <Nobun>	omero sto facendo una cosa molto brutta sappilo xD
Aug 31 16:18:50 <Mathisen>	oneliner, you need something on windows side to accept rsync connection and that would be ssh
Aug 31 16:19:07 <eviladmin>	Nobun: and as it says right under that, always quite the array expansion
Aug 31 16:19:09 <Elodin>	Hello, i've been trying to make a bootable usb but i've been unsuccessful, all isos i burn in the usb yields [FAILED] in everything when booting. How could i prevent this?
Aug 31 16:19:12 <eviladmin>	quote*
Aug 31 16:19:22 <oneliner>	ssh as in putty?
Aug 31 16:20:09 <eviladmin>	oneliner: no mingw required btw
Aug 31 16:20:43 <Mathisen>	oneliner, putty is just a ssh client not server so no
Aug 31 16:20:54 <eviladmin>	windows 10 has a ssh client/server now
Aug 31 16:21:05 <Mathisen>	indeed it does
Aug 31 16:21:28 <eviladmin>	Apps > Apps and Features > Manage Optional Features -> install openssh client/server as needed
Aug 31 16:21:45 <eviladmin>	or powershell
Aug 31 16:21:50 <eviladmin>	or trough*
Aug 31 16:21:57 <Mathisen>	Elodin, how did you make the usb with dd ?
Aug 31 16:21:59 <oneliner>	ohh i see, the remote would be the rsync client,.. yeah besides not having a server my ISP has all sorts of funky "we own your sorry sit space " firewalls so yeah, cant serve from here not even a gmt clock
Aug 31 16:22:08 <Mathisen>	Elodin, and is this linux isos or other OS ?
Aug 31 16:22:36 <eviladmin>	oneliner: wireguard/openvpn avoids such issues
Aug 31 16:23:36 <oneliner>	and suddenly i have a saturday project, thanks eviladmin, Mathisen i ll give it a shot
Aug 31 16:24:03 <eviladmin>	oneliner: wireguard is more like a 2 min copy/paste job
Aug 31 16:24:41 <oneliner>	yeah dont push your advanced user expectations on me :P
Aug 31 16:25:01 <Elodin>	Mathisen: i made it with opensuse imagewriter. I'm trying dd now actually. They are all linux images.
Aug 31 16:25:28 <Mathisen>	Elodin, easy then >> dd if=/path/to/foobar.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
Aug 31 16:25:36 <Mathisen>	Elodin, sdX = your usb so change that
Aug 31 16:26:01 <Elodin>	Mathisen: yeah, i already run it, althought without the bs argument, would that be a problem?
Aug 31 16:26:15 <Mathisen>	can be but most likely no
Aug 31 16:29:57 <Elodin>	Mathisen: does this seem correct to you? https://i.imgur.com/RZtf1UR.png
Aug 31 16:31:30 <Elodin>	Mathisen: same errors
Aug 31 16:31:37 <Mathisen>	what error ?
Aug 31 16:31:50 <Elodin>	all instances appear [FAILED]
Aug 31 16:31:53 <Elodin>	when booting
Aug 31 16:31:54 <Nobun>	eviladmin: yeah I see... I am trying to figure now how to correctly transform a bash string output (like $(ls ...) example) in array
Aug 31 16:31:58 <Elodin>	in the boot proccess
Aug 31 16:31:59 <eviladmin>	Elodin: ryzen 3xxx?
Aug 31 16:32:01 <Nobun>	using ls, cat etc
Aug 31 16:32:05 <Elodin>	eviladmin: exactly
Aug 31 16:32:10 <eviladmin>	Elodin: 1. update the firmware
Aug 31 16:32:20 *	Mathisen hides away again
Aug 31 16:32:20 <eviladmin>	Elodin: 2. get a newer install image
Aug 31 16:32:21 <Elodin>	eviladmin: on the motherboard?
Aug 31 16:32:23 <eviladmin>	yes
Aug 31 16:32:29 <Elodin>	eviladmin: it's already updates
Aug 31 16:32:37 <eviladmin>	sure it is the latest version?
Aug 31 16:32:49 <eviladmin>	because the new aegsa fixes it
Aug 31 16:32:59 <Elodin>	eviladmin: i already installed linux on the ssd inside it once
Aug 31 16:33:09 <Elodin>	lemme see the version
Aug 31 16:33:12 <eviladmin>	Elodin: with an older systemd I bet
Aug 31 16:33:24 <Elodin>	eviladmin: ubuntults
Aug 31 16:33:29 <Elodin>	18.something
Aug 31 16:33:36 <Elodin>	i was trying 19.something now
Aug 31 16:33:38 <eviladmin>	righ, so ancient systemd
Aug 31 16:33:44 <eviladmin>	AGESA 1.0.0.3 ABB fixes it
Aug 31 16:33:45 <Elodin>	oh really
Aug 31 16:33:51 <eviladmin>	so does using a newer systemd than 19.04 has
Aug 31 16:33:52 <Elodin>	lemme see if i have bios update then
Aug 31 16:33:56 <Gustavo6046>	How do I flush the IO queue? I have copied some files to a partition in an image file, which is also used by a virt-manager VM as a shareable USB device. But, for some reason, it doesn't appear in the VM, even after unmounting this image in the host.
Aug 31 16:34:23 <eviladmin>	Elodin: which board is it?
Aug 31 16:34:39 <eviladmin>	Elodin: some silly board makers have not updated to the latest agesa yet
Aug 31 16:35:13 <Elodin>	eviladmin: https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/PRIME-B450M-A/HelpDesk_Manual
Aug 31 16:35:53 <eviladmin>	nice, doesn't have the ABB yet...
Aug 31 16:36:00 <Elodin>	FUCK me
Aug 31 16:36:06 <eviladmin>	so you need a newer systemd
Aug 31 16:36:18 <Elodin>	you mean an older
Aug 31 16:36:21 <eviladmin>	go and tell asus to update their shit
Aug 31 16:36:23 <eviladmin>	Elodin: no, newer
Aug 31 16:36:54 <eviladmin>	Elodin: workaround/"fix" was pushed to systemd too
Aug 31 16:36:55 <Elodin>	why did i had to buy this processor? damn
Aug 31 16:37:14 <eviladmin>	Elodin: amd for some reason have screwed up rdrandr for almost a decade now
Aug 31 16:37:15 <eviladmin>	>_>
Aug 31 16:37:27 <eviladmin>	and they clearly didn't bother to do any real testing, or they just didn't care :p
Aug 31 16:37:45 <eviladmin>	anyway, tell asus to update to the latest microcode :)
Aug 31 16:37:58 <triceratux>	eviladmin: kms video= wont let me force vesa or modesetting from the bootloader commandline http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/faqs/boot-options.html
Aug 31 16:38:10 <eviladmin>	triceratux: never said it did
Aug 31 16:38:20 <eviladmin>	why the heck would you ever want vesa though?
Aug 31 16:38:28 <triceratux>	eviladmin: if ive got a system still loading intel i have to delete it like its an r128_drv.so
Aug 31 16:38:32 <eviladmin>	video lets you set the mode you want and disable outputs you are not using
Aug 31 16:38:50 <eviladmin>	triceratux: that is the ddx driver, has nothing to do with kms
Aug 31 16:38:50 <triceratux>	eviladmin: cause i dont trust xorg or nvidia rofl
Aug 31 16:38:59 <eviladmin>	has nothing to do with nvidia either
Aug 31 16:39:26 <eviladmin>	any sane distro would disable kms if you install the nvidia driver btw
Aug 31 16:39:38 <eviladmin>	(optionally enable nvidia kms instead)
Aug 31 16:39:55 <Elodin>	eviladmin: where do i check this agesa thing?
Aug 31 16:39:58 <triceratux>	eviladmin: i dont trust the state of linux graphics. i always loved xforcevesa on ubuntu because guess what. it forces vesa. it doesnt work anymore. i watched it happen
Aug 31 16:40:13 <eviladmin>	Elodin: "Update AGESA 1.0.0.3 Patch AB to improve compatibility;" it says on the download page
Aug 31 16:40:34 <eviladmin>	>_>
Aug 31 16:40:41 <eviladmin>	not making any sense at all
Aug 31 16:40:58 <eviladmin>	you are just as well off with a serial console as using vesa
Aug 31 16:41:12 <eviladmin>	at least the serial console will be more responsive and with less render glitches :p
Aug 31 16:41:14 <dreamcat4_>	hello. filed this bug with nvidia and it is still being ignored - https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049107/linux/-linux-xorg-multiple-monitors-limits-the-framerate-of-faster-120-144hz-monitors-to-60hz/
Aug 31 16:42:05 <bipul>	Nvidia has always problem with Linux.
Aug 31 16:42:30 <eviladmin>	amd and intel are no better
Aug 31 16:43:19 <eviladmin>	dreamcat4_: sidenote: gnome locks the fps to the slowest display with vsync too
Aug 31 16:43:29 <eviladmin>	unless you are running 3.35
Aug 31 16:43:42 <eviladmin>	33*
Aug 31 16:43:47 <ThothCastel>	I am running Ubuntu on a VMware Workstation VM on a laptop host machine with 16GB RAM, 1 Wireless adapter and 1 NIC of 1GB speed, the VM is picking up only 10MB speed for the connection when my host laptop is connected via WIFI - although my VM says it is 'wired' and I don't see my wireless adapter in my VM - why not? and why getting this limited speed? Network adapter is 'Natted'
Aug 31 16:44:30 <dreamcat4_>	eviladmin: well yeah... i has initially asked the gnome people to check up on this issue first, and they then said they had fixed their bugs in mutter, and it must be left also in the display driver
Aug 31 16:44:58 <dreamcat4_>	eviladmin: but if that is not the case, then perhaps it would be better situation because afaict NVIDIA are completely ignoring this bug
Aug 31 16:45:18 <eviladmin>	dreamcat4_: amd and intel have ignored lots of bugs for years too so....
Aug 31 16:45:25 <dreamcat4_>	wheras the gnome people actually respond / seem to take the matter more seriously
Aug 31 16:45:49 <eviladmin>	dreamcat4_: eg check the status of integer scaling on amd currently
Aug 31 16:45:58 <eviladmin>	even nvidia supports it now
Aug 31 16:46:19 <dreamcat4_>	it really pisses me off. pretty much to the extent that i am not buying a new GPU from them until they fix this specific issue
Aug 31 16:49:22 <eviladmin>	their price gauging is a better reason not to
Aug 31 16:49:33 <eviladmin>	though amd have jumped on that bandwagon too now so...
Aug 31 16:49:45 <eviladmin>	and I doubt intel will price Xe anymore reasonable
Aug 31 16:49:49 <Elodin>	eviladmin: so it has the agesa thing right?
Aug 31 16:50:06 <eviladmin>	Elodin: as said, workaround also awailable in a newer systemd
Aug 31 16:50:22 <Elodin>	eviladmin: what is the workaround?
Aug 31 16:50:29 <triceratux>	omero: hrm this is actually a thing http://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/faqs/intel-graphics.html
Aug 31 16:50:47 <eviladmin>	Elodin: search the git tree for rdrandr
Aug 31 16:51:09 <eviladmin>	biggest issue, sort of, is that there have not been a new systemd release yet though
Aug 31 16:51:12 <triceratux>	that keyword SVIDEO-1 isnt in the kernel doc o.O
Aug 31 16:51:26 <eviladmin>	triceratux: hardware dependent
Aug 31 16:51:36 <eviladmin>	it is not a keyword, it is a identifier
Aug 31 16:51:47 <triceratux>	vendor extensible
Aug 31 16:52:20 *	triceratux is a nomodesetter on his first day with kms video= :)
Aug 31 16:52:22 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: The virtual NIC your VM uses is a fiction.  It does not actually exist, nor does the wired network it appears to be connected to.
Aug 31 16:52:28 <eviladmin>	Elodin: strange if ubuntu haven't released a install image with a backported fix though
Aug 31 16:52:37 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: If it's being "detected" as 10base-T then you provisioned the wrong type of virtual NIC
Aug 31 16:52:49 <omero>	triceratux, noted!
Aug 31 16:52:54 <eviladmin>	Elodin: can always bootstrap 19.04 with the fix from 19.10 or from 18.04 though
Aug 31 16:53:30 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: If at all possible, use the virtio versions of devices, since the drivers for the virtual device types exist for most operating systems now, and additionally are generally the most efficient
Aug 31 16:54:17 <eviladmin>	Elodin: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ryzen-3000-BIOS-Update-Good
Aug 31 16:54:26 <eviladmin>	Elodin: real problem is asus not updating the board though
Aug 31 16:54:46 <eviladmin>	(ignoring that the fault should not have existed in the first place)
Aug 31 16:55:08 <eviladmin>	Elodin: maybe they have a beta firmware? you could email them and ask
Aug 31 16:56:10 <Dagmar>	pYeah that's probably a bad idea
Aug 31 16:57:03 <eviladmin>	asus are usually pretty fast with firmware updates
Aug 31 16:57:25 <ThothCastel>	Dagmar: I thought Ubuntu was to detect my wireless adapter?
Aug 31 16:57:30 <ThothCastel>	and install its driver
Aug 31 16:57:38 <Dagmar>	It's only because of the small personal sample size that you're rather blissfully unaware that ASUS support bears more than a passing resemblance to Russian Roulette.
Aug 31 16:57:40 <ThothCastel>	it is a 2017 laptop
Aug 31 16:57:45 <ThothCastel>	hp430 g5
Aug 31 16:57:53 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: you don't need the wireless driver *inside* the vm
Aug 31 16:58:06 <eviladmin>	unless you are actually doing usb/pci passtrough of the device
Aug 31 16:58:17 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: No, everything your VM will see is imaginary.  The network it sees is just a pretty story told to it by the operating system courtesy of the virtual bridge driver
Aug 31 16:58:24 <Blondie101010>	s/don't need/should not give access to/
Aug 31 16:59:04 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: You have to really go out of your way to dedicate any actual, _real_ hardware device to a VM, and there are very few reasons for doing so for _some_ of the devices, and ther's almost never a reason to do that for a NIC
Aug 31 17:00:22 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: The system will do masquerading of IP networking for your VM just fine, and the VM basically won't have to care whether the laptop is connected via wireless or the wired network
Aug 31 17:00:29 <faceface>	hello
Aug 31 17:00:55 <ThothCastel>	Dagmar: right - I was thinking in making use of VMWare workstation to run various servers in my home network but it looks that what I reaaaaaly need is ESXi
Aug 31 17:01:04 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: The VM's operating system only really needs to know how to use the virtual devices it sees
Aug 31 17:01:23 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: better: gnu/linux host
Aug 31 17:01:25 <Blondie101010>	ThothCastel:  inside VMs, the NIC is usually a plain enumerator which does not limit the speed
Aug 31 17:01:33 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: no, for home use you can get away with just using virt-manager as an interface to KVM/QEMU
Aug 31 17:01:44 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: no reason to pay 1000€ for vmware
Aug 31 17:01:49 <Blondie101010>	he's using vmware
Aug 31 17:01:56 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel; The virt-manager interface is simple enough that you'll be able to go between that and vSphere without any real issues
Aug 31 17:02:02 <faceface>	I've been thinking about trying to 'adblock' my home wifi, but I'm not sure how to do it. One way seems to be pihole DNS, another seems to be using privoxy proxy. Can anyone recommend a simple way to do it?
Aug 31 17:02:11 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: THey pretty much cloned a lot of the vSphere interface
Aug 31 17:02:23 <faceface>	I have a home NAS running FreeBSD where I can run either (I guess)
Aug 31 17:02:29 <eviladmin>	faceface: 3. buy yourself a proper router
Aug 31 17:02:35 <faceface>	The DNS solution seems simplest
Aug 31 17:02:38 <Mathisen>	pihole is great
Aug 31 17:02:39 <Blondie101010>	faceface:  you already answered your question
Aug 31 17:02:42 <faceface>	hi eviladmin
Aug 31 17:02:52 <eviladmin>	faceface: well, just set up a dns server on the freebsd box then and use it
Aug 31 17:03:06 <omero>	could someone have a look and tell me if I got that correctly? https://termbin.com/931w9
Aug 31 17:03:07 <faceface>	Blondie101010: right, but before I start, do you recommend one or the other or perhaps a different DNS or proxy solution?
Aug 31 17:03:15 <ThothCastel>	I seevirt-manager is an aternative to virtualbox / VMWare workstation?
Aug 31 17:03:16 <eviladmin>	plain freebsd or freenas?
Aug 31 17:03:20 <Dagmar>	Pihole is so effective they should really separate the zone files into their own project and whitepaper the thing so it can be easily integrated into other compatible systems
Aug 31 17:03:24 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: sort of
Aug 31 17:03:29 <ThothCastel>	Dagmar: ESXi is also free
Aug 31 17:03:31 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: it can also manage virtualbox
Aug 31 17:03:31 <faceface>	eviladmin: oh, FreeNAS actually
Aug 31 17:03:47 <eviladmin>	faceface: there are several dns add blocker plugins for freenas
Aug 31 17:04:22 <eviladmin>	"plugin"/jail/whateverthatnewthingiscalled
Aug 31 17:04:37 <faceface>	eviladmin: Thanks, good tip
Aug 31 17:05:09 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: We don't "do" ESXi here
Aug 31 17:05:14 <eviladmin>	you could probably stuff pihole in a container on freenas too
Aug 31 17:05:30 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel; ...and just because something is free does not by itself mean it's worth using
Aug 31 17:05:32 <faceface>	So I run Pihole or similar on the BSD box, then point my router at that DNS, and in theory, every machine on my wifi is now ad and tracker blocked?
Aug 31 17:05:56 <eviladmin>	yes
Aug 31 17:05:56 <ThothCastel>	I will have Virt-manager  a go :)
Aug 31 17:05:57 <Dagmar>	faceface: No, you point all your lan clients at that DNS server running on the BSD box
Aug 31 17:06:04 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: needs gnu/linux host
Aug 31 17:06:06 <ThothCastel>	is it what they call 'KVM?
Aug 31 17:06:20 <Dagmar>	ThothCastel: virt-manager interfaces with KVM which runs QEMU
Aug 31 17:06:33 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: can you suggest a good linux  host for running it?
Aug 31 17:06:39 <faceface>	Dagmar: right, but that should happen transparently via the routers DHCP?
Aug 31 17:06:47 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: virt-manager is a frontend for several hypervisors, including virtualbox, qemu and xen
Aug 31 17:06:58 <ThothCastel>	I see
Aug 31 17:07:05 <Dagmar>	fontface: Assuming you remember to tell the DHCP server to give out the proper DNS server information with the leases, yes
Aug 31 17:07:14 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: down to preferences really
Aug 31 17:07:17 <faceface>	Thanks
Aug 31 17:07:31 <ThothCastel>	so are you saying that if I use Virt-manager to interact with my VMware workstation , then I might get what i need?
Aug 31 17:07:33 <Dagmar>	it worried me there becuase you were talking about having the router use the DNS server, and routing doesn't really involve DNS at all
Aug 31 17:07:37 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: no
Aug 31 17:07:45 <faceface>	Now I need to go re-wire my FreeNAS box... had to move it ;-)
Aug 31 17:07:46 <eviladmin>	you don't want to involve vmware at all
Aug 31 17:07:58 <ThothCastel>	right
Aug 31 17:08:09 <Dagmar>	vmware seems largely interested in justifying why they have licencing fees
Aug 31 17:08:13 <eviladmin>	faceface: switch to cat6a or cat7/fibre while you are at it
Aug 31 17:08:26 <ThothCastel>	so Virt-manager is for qemu, xen, other
Aug 31 17:08:27 <ThothCastel>	just like vsphere is for ESXi VMware ?
Aug 31 17:08:42 <Dagmar>	There's a LOT of checkboxes that msot people are going to not use, that only serve to shoot majority-case users in various parts of their lower torso and/or face.  Like _compressed RAM_
Aug 31 17:08:59 <Dagmar>	Mostly, yes
Aug 31 17:09:45 <Dagmar>	We had an "architect" enable compressed RAM on a large, high-peforming MySQL server in the middle of the day, without going through change management.
Aug 31 17:09:58 <Dagmar>	I really should have been asking why he wasn't written up for that.
Aug 31 17:10:31 <Dagmar>	The thing cruised at 25,000qps and promptly dropped to less than half that while making the load indicator double and triple
Aug 31 17:11:07 <Dagmar>	Enabling that feature on a system that regularly pages through several gigabytes of RAM over nad over was just _stupid_
Aug 31 17:11:20 <Dagmar>	Doing it outside of change management was unprofessisonal.
Aug 31 17:11:38 <Dagmar>	Doing it in the middle of production hours was IMHO unforgiveable

Aug 31 17:15:28 <mawk>	so you fired him Dagmar
Aug 31 17:15:48 <a90c>	hi
Aug 31 17:15:56 <Dagmar>	mawk> No.  This place was insane and ran on the Peter Principle, so six months later they were asking me to submit changes to the idiot
Aug 31 17:16:01 <a90c>	i need a solution about this topic: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/119653
Aug 31 17:16:02 <esselfe>	I'm trying to parse some weather site HTML so I can retrieve weather on the command line
Aug 31 17:16:06 <a90c>	Any ideas?
Aug 31 17:16:41 <Dagmar>	mawk: I would have required _him_ to put all his changes through change management, and would have _fired him_ if he ever made an LOB change to a production system outside of a maintenance window ever again
Aug 31 17:16:45 <FMan>	I am deleting an old operating system, but I want to preserve anything that I might want to reference later. So far I have /etc, /home and /root archived. Do I really need anything else?
Aug 31 17:17:01 <Dagmar>	mawk: I mean, compressed RAM on a large database server?  Really?
Aug 31 17:17:05 <infinisil>	FMan: /var/lib?
Aug 31 17:17:13 <esselfe>	Blondie101010: what? HTML is meant to be human-redeable for sure, just look at the tags, they're not serial numbers, but almost. What I say is that it should be human readeable
Aug 31 17:17:23 <FMan>	I have a listing of installed packages
Aug 31 17:17:49 <mawk>	he must have thought "cool that makes more RAM for free"
Aug 31 17:17:50 <ThothCastel>	= KVM = QEMU?
Aug 31 17:17:52 <Dagmar>	mawk: I probably should have left there long before I did
Aug 31 17:17:58 <esselfe>	this kind of gibberish HTML is probably generated by visual IDE, click and drop
Aug 31 17:18:01 <mawk>	almost ThothCastel yes, QEMU is a KVM client if you want
Aug 31 17:18:15 <mawk>	yeah well any place with idiots in places higher than me would make me want to quit
Aug 31 17:18:21 <mawk>	in technical places
Aug 31 17:18:32 <uio>	MAGA
Aug 31 17:18:38 <Blondie101010>	esselfe:  you complained that the pages were not written in a way that their source could was not readable by you...  that either makes you HTML illiterate or it makes HTML not really human readable - your choice
Aug 31 17:18:45 <esselfe>	Blondie101010: readeable like this: https://termbin.com/4gth
Aug 31 17:18:56 <Blondie101010>	web pages are made to be parsed, not read by humans
Aug 31 17:19:04 <Dagmar>	mawk: That appears to be what he was thinking.  Anyone with more than 5 years experience however, would have known that repeatedly scanning multi-Gb databases that the DB server is trying to keep in memory will mean repeatedly decompressing and compressing multitple gigabytes of data, which is no longer a time-trivial operation
Aug 31 17:19:07 <Blondie101010>	I know HTML but obviously you don't
Aug 31 17:19:59 <RayTracer>	esselfe: how about curl wttr.in/Montreal
Aug 31 17:20:07 <Dagmar>	mawk: That he wanted to argue with two guys that collectively had 35 years of experience pushed me straight into disbelief
Aug 31 17:20:57 <geirha>	esselfe: consider finding a weather site with a decent rest api rather than scraping the data off html pages

Aug 31 17:37:28 <uio>	funksh0n, No bluetooth on my laptop.
Aug 31 17:37:38 <eviladmin>	NGC3982: why use winscp when windows now have a proper ssh client/server?

Aug 31 17:39:23 <akk>	Anyone understand systemd and the login service? I have a lubuntu system with sddm disabled (because I want to run straight openbox)
Aug 31 17:39:41 <akk>	and suddenly it has stopped offering a getty on tty1, though I can log in on tty2 etc.
Aug 31 17:39:51 <eviladmin>	akk: sddm doesn't prevent you from running "straight openbox"
Aug 31 17:40:26 <akk>	eviladmin: I tried it and openbox was severely messed up, and I asked on #lubuntu and they said it was a known problem that it didn't work, they didn't know of a solution.
Aug 31 17:40:43 <eviladmin>	akk: systemctl status getty@tty1.service
Aug 31 17:41:44 <eviladmin>	and how exactly did you disable sddm?
Aug 31 17:41:45 <akk>	eviladmin: For systemctl status getty@tty1.service: I tried enabling it earlier, status says it's loaded but inactive (dead)
Aug 31 17:42:13 <uio>	Is the atom processor better than the centrino?
Aug 31 17:42:30 <akk>	eviladmin: Before I explicitly activated it, I had tried systemctl list-unit-files | grep getty, and  there was a getty@ service but no getty@tty[anything]
Aug 31 17:42:56 <eviladmin>	because they are created on demand
Aug 31 17:42:57 <akk>	so I wonder if when I tried enabling it, it just enabled a nonexistent service and that's why it's inactive.
Aug 31 17:43:46 <akk>	The gettys on the other ttys are still working. The weird thing is, this was all working last night and I'm not aware of having done anything that would muck with systemd services.
Aug 31 17:43:49 <eviladmin>	how did you disable sddm, and what is in your logind.conf?
Aug 31 17:44:06 <eviladmin>	and post the output from systemctl
Aug 31 17:44:19 <akk>	I disabled it with: systemctl disable sddm
Aug 31 17:44:29 <eviladmin>	did you try to set up some autologin?
Aug 31 17:44:39 <eviladmin>	or autostart of X?
Aug 31 17:44:40 <akk>	no
Aug 31 17:44:45 <akk>	no, nor that either
Aug 31 17:46:38 <akk>	sec, I'm copying the two files you asked for, has to go through a couple different machines
Aug 31 17:46:49 <eviladmin>	no network on the machine?
Aug 31 17:47:52 <akk>	It has a network but it's new and doesn't yet have any ssh keys on it that would let it scp to my web server
Aug 31 17:48:20 <eviladmin>	just use curl
Aug 31 17:48:44 <eviladmin>	curl -F file=@- https://0x0.st   or similar
Aug 31 17:48:57 <eviladmin>	replace - with actual filename if not reading from stdin
Aug 31 17:49:16 <omero>	curl -v -4 -F'file=@SCREENSHOT.DeskWinw.2019-08-31-17.08.35.png' http://0x0.st
Aug 31 17:50:04 <omero>	something new, triceratux ! seems I got that kind of lucky with the E8410, stumbling in all kind of problems :D
Aug 31 17:50:12 <omero>	http://0x0.st/z4yW.png
Aug 31 17:50:13 <akk>	Put the files at http://shallowsky.com/tmp/tty/ (renamed to have .txt on them so the web server will show them as text)
Aug 31 17:50:36 <akk>	but I can use 0x0.st if you prefer
Aug 31 17:51:09 <eviladmin>	text, not images of text
Aug 31 17:51:16 <Gustavo6046>	So the OpenSSH server has a host key, but this key has a passphrase. I don't know where in sshd_config to put this passphrase.
Aug 31 17:51:29 <Gustavo6046>	As in, how to put it in sshd_config, I mean.
Aug 31 17:52:05 <lupine>	you wouldn't
Aug 31 17:52:06 <omero>	that happened when closed the lid, while still connected via ssh... hadn't noticed it before, because never been also remote (on root! ahhhhhh)
Aug 31 17:52:10 <lupine>	just enter it on startup
Aug 31 17:52:14 <lupine>	or remove it, I guess
Aug 31 17:52:45 <omero>	system's still running tho... and the more I explore, the more I like it, triceratux ;)
Aug 31 17:52:49 <eviladmin>	missing systemctl status getty@tty1.service
Aug 31 17:52:52 <Gustavo6046>	It doesn't ask for the passphrase.
Aug 31 17:53:30 <omero>	its very very intuitive... I think some kudos would go to mystic too, since he 'caused' my curiosity to trigger ^.^
Aug 31 17:53:34 <Gustavo6046>	Guess I don't need it.
Aug 31 17:54:20 <akk>	eviladmin: sorry, it's there now
Aug 31 17:54:28 <Dagmar>	Most people _don't_ use them _because_ it makes unattended reboots impossible
Aug 31 17:55:01 <eviladmin>	a lot of people do use them but uses a keyring to still be able to automate access
Aug 31 17:55:02 <Dagmar>	This is particularly painful when combined with the very thing that an admin would use to reach into the machine with to fix any problems
Aug 31 17:55:03 <Gustavo6046>	Also, virt-manager has no sound. No audio device is detected, at least by Windows VMs.
Aug 31 17:55:24 <Dagmar>	Did you _add_ a sound device do the virtual machine?
Aug 31 17:55:30 <Gustavo6046>	ICH6.
Aug 31 17:55:37 <Dagmar>	The default is generally to add a generic ICH (IIRC) one
Aug 31 17:55:48 <Dagmar>	It should be detected, or at least the driver is readily available
Aug 31 17:56:06 <Gustavo6046>	https://i.imgur.com/b8Y2n1P.png
Aug 31 17:56:17 <eviladmin>	akk: did you reboot since disabeling it?
Aug 31 17:57:05 <Dagmar>	HAve you rebooted the VM since adding the virtual sound card?
Aug 31 17:57:10 <Gustavo6046>	It was already there.
Aug 31 17:57:15 <Dagmar>	Not much is going to expect hot-plugged audio cards
Aug 31 17:57:21 <Dagmar>	Then you have a windows problem
Aug 31 17:57:35 <Gustavo6046>	Maybe Windows doesn't know ICH?
Aug 31 17:57:38 <akk>	eviladmin: Since disabling sddm? Yes, several times, and it was working fine.
Aug 31 17:57:45 <Dagmar>	You should be able to boot a live linux ISO on that machine in a few minutes and be able to verfiy that the audio device is there with lspci
Aug 31 17:58:21 <Dagmar>	Gustavo6046: Intel HDA is common enough Windows 10 (and possibly 7 as well) should already have a driver, but it won't hurt to try snagging one from Intel
Aug 31 17:59:01 <Dagmar>	I'm on the other side of that fence, where I keep forgetting to uncheck the thing that adds them by default because my VMs are practically headless all the time
Aug 31 17:59:07 <akk>	eviladmin: (I'm 95% sure of that, anyway. Wish I could say I was 100% sure but I admit I'm not)
Aug 31 17:59:13 <Dagmar>	I usually toss the virtual serial device as wlel
Aug 31 18:01:09 <omero>	Merc: btw... I got what you meant by 'user data separated' ... I'm using a similar thing, without uppercased 'directory names' ... one home for them them all, one home to fall...
Aug 31 18:02:31 <eviladmin>	works if you start getty@tty1.service manually?
Aug 31 18:03:03 <a90c>	How to find e1000 driver version in kernel?
Aug 31 18:03:20 <eviladmin>	it doesn't really have versions
Aug 31 18:03:30 <akik>	a90c: modinfo e1000
Aug 31 18:03:53 <akk>	eviladmin: No, I tried sudo systemctl enable getty@tty1.service and there's still no login prompt on ctrl-alt-f1
Aug 31 18:04:09 <eviladmin>	enable does not start
Aug 31 18:04:16 <eviladmin>	those are different things
Aug 31 18:04:24 <eviladmin>	(there is enable --now which does both)
Aug 31 18:04:29 <akk>	Ah. Same command with start instead of enable?
Aug 31 18:04:34 <eviladmin>	yes
Aug 31 18:04:55 <akk>	Yes, that works, now I have a login prompt.
Aug 31 18:06:11 <akk>	Any idea why it won't start automatically?
Aug 31 18:09:50 <Dagmar>	You broke it somehow?
Aug 31 18:09:57 <Dagmar>	Or it simply wasn't enabled until now
Aug 31 18:10:16 <akk>	Oh, so after starting it, if I reboot it should still start? /me tries
Aug 31 18:10:23 <Dagmar>	After _enabling_ it
Aug 31 18:10:43 <Dagmar>	Enabling a service is a persistent setting
Aug 31 18:10:49 <akk>	I had already enabled it with that systemctl enable command, but it didn't start after reboot.
Aug 31 18:10:57 <Dagmar>	Starting a service isn't even a setting, it just launches the associated processes or runs the whatever
Aug 31 18:11:12 <akk>	and it still doesn't start now after a reboot
Aug 31 18:11:30 <Dagmar>	Then something's broken and you should consult the journal to see what it says about what happened when it tried to start it
Aug 31 18:11:49 <akk>	Where's the journal?
Aug 31 18:12:41 <akk>	journalctl?
Aug 31 18:12:47 <RayTracer>	akk: yes
Aug 31 18:12:48 <hexnewbie>	journalctl -u getty@tty1.service -n3000
Aug 31 18:14:51 <akk>	http://shallowsky.com/tmp/tty/journal.txt
Aug 31 18:16:09 <eviladmin>	-b is also useful
Aug 31 18:17:09 <eviladmin>	post systemctl status getty@tty2.service  too
Aug 31 18:17:31 <ThothCastel>	xen and KVM are open source but it seems that they are limted in functionality?
Aug 31 18:17:43 <ThothCastel>	failover, etc
Aug 31 18:18:45 <Blondie101010>	ThothCastel:  if you need vmware, use it
Aug 31 18:19:10 <Blondie101010>	you didn't mention ANY point justifying changing it
Aug 31 18:19:13 <GNU\colossus>	ThothCastel, both xen and qemu can live-migrate guest systems
Aug 31 18:19:27 <ThothCastel>	Blondie101010: I like more the idea of getting all functions in an open source
Aug 31 18:19:29 <Blondie101010>	yes, but do they do it automatically?
Aug 31 18:19:38 <jim>	curious... should systemctl | grep getty@tty show me about 6 services?
Aug 31 18:19:43 <GNU\colossus>	no, but there are mgmt solutions that do/can
Aug 31 18:19:52 <ThothCastel>	what about KVM?
Aug 31 18:20:02 <ThothCastel>	is there a license requirement for anything?
Aug 31 18:20:18 <GNU\colossus>	qemu _is_ what KVM was merged into
Aug 31 18:20:27 <eviladmin>	jim: if you have logins on 6 tty's
Aug 31 18:20:29 <eviladmin>	else no
Aug 31 18:20:37 <GNU\colossus>	no, both can do these things without a "license"
Aug 31 18:20:47 <GNU\colossus>	check out ganeti, for instance
Aug 31 18:21:02 <eviladmin>	jim: they are usually created on demand, though some distroes might override that of course
Aug 31 18:21:31 <jim>	eviladmin, it looks like I do, but I only seem to have getty@tty1.service
Aug 31 18:21:49 <ThothCastel>	when adding memory or storage, etc to a running VM, can KVM and XEN do that without having to power off the vm?
Aug 31 18:21:54 <jim>	running debian buster
Aug 31 18:22:18 <omero>	ahem... reiterating a question: |2019-08-31+17:47:23|     omero)) curl -v -4 -F'file=@SCREENSHOT.DeskWinw.2019-08-31-17.08.35.png' http://0x0.st <<-- can someone have a look and comment about ?
Aug 31 18:22:27 <omero>	argh
Aug 31 18:22:36 <omero>	sorry wrong one
Aug 31 18:22:40 <akk>	eviladmin: http://shallowsky.com/tmp/tty/ now has systemctl status for tty2 (where I'm currently logged in) and 3 (where I'm not)
Aug 31 18:22:44 <hexnewbie>	ThothCastel: Xen and QEMU can, most of the time.
Aug 31 18:23:10 <jim>	now I do see them
Aug 31 18:23:18 <omero>	omero)) could someone have a look and tell me if I got that correctly? https://termbin.com/931w9 <-- correct reiteration of previous question
Aug 31 18:23:24 <eviladmin>	jim: systemd-getty-generator is responsible for generating them
Aug 31 18:23:44 <eviladmin>	though the sysvinit compability mess that debian uses might affect things
Aug 31 18:23:55 <akk>	eviladmin:  journalctl -u getty@tty1.service -n3000 didn't have anything useful, I'm looking through just journalctl -b but it's long, I could post just the lines from the current boot if you want to see them.
Aug 31 18:24:14 <jim>	and a "demand" in this case, is hitting ctrl-alt-Fn where n in 1-6?
Aug 31 18:24:31 <eviladmin>	yes
Aug 31 18:25:19 <jim>	what doesn't exist initially... the getty itself, and the vt?
Aug 31 18:26:43 <omero>	I guess the final image I got on 'local' (the 2Gb blah.gz) is the result of 'remote' /dev/sda being transferred is mostly 'pristine', with lots of empty unallocated space... dd is doing the 'Right Thing(tm)', gzip does then 'condense the fog' and the result is much more compacted than the 'whole HDD being dumped'
Aug 31 18:26:45 <akk>	The journalctl -b output includes a line: Condition check resulted in getty on tty2-tty6 if dbus and logind are not available being skipped.
Aug 31 18:27:18 <ThothCastel>	it looks to me that KVM is more like QEMU, virtualbox and vmware workstation
Aug 31 18:27:32 <ThothCastel>	kvm not baremetal hypervisor?
Aug 31 18:27:57 <akk>	I'm having a little trouble parsing that line. ps aux does show dbus-daemon and /lib/systemd/systemd-logind running, but I don't know if that's what it's looking for.
Aug 31 18:28:11 <hexnewbie>	ThothCastel: Literally yes and no. KVM is in Linux, and Linux is baremetal, but QEMU is not.
Aug 31 18:28:37 <ThothCastel>	so QEMU is not baremetal right?
Aug 31 18:28:39 <ThothCastel>	ok cool
Aug 31 18:29:16 <ThothCastel>	it seems that if one wants a baremetal solution and does not want ESXi, then XEN Server is the only option
Aug 31 18:29:27 <hexnewbie>	So QEMU/KVM is simultaneously hosted and bare-metal.
Aug 31 18:29:34 <eviladmin>	ThothCastel: might want to consider using containers instead of full VMs for your services too
Aug 31 18:30:14 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: I might play with that once I have my new physical server in place
Aug 31 18:30:22 <ThothCastel>	I might run a few services in Dockers
Aug 31 18:30:46 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: is it ok to run dockers in a virtualized linux machine?
Aug 31 18:30:52 <eviladmin>	most services could simply be run directly on the host too
Aug 31 18:30:52 <ThothCastel>	virtual inside of  a virtual
Aug 31 18:31:01 <eviladmin>	often a better choice than containers
Aug 31 18:31:16 <eviladmin>	things like horrible webapps etc are more a use case for containers
Aug 31 18:31:52 <ThothCastel>	eviladmin: right, I was thinking of running solarwinds monitoring
Aug 31 18:31:58 <ThothCastel>	possibly nagios also
Aug 31 18:32:01 <ThothCastel>	for comparison purposes
Aug 31 18:33:13 *	eviladmin would replace nagios with netdata :p
Aug 31 18:34:51 <ThothCastel>	can kvm be run on a ubuntu server?
Aug 31 18:35:28 <akk>	I found a page saying that systemd's getty@ service has some special logic for tty1 if systemd thinks the system is booted into a display manager.
Aug 31 18:35:45 <omero>	what... nagios still exists?!
Aug 31 18:35:49 <akk>	But I can't find anything elaborating on that, like where it looks to decide if there's a dm.
Aug 31 18:36:35 <phogg>	sounds like time to check the code
Aug 31 18:36:49 <calious>	akk: systemd services can block getty from starting on a tty depending on what they do
Aug 31 18:37:19 <akk>	calious: The question is, why is it blocking this? I'm not running a dm, how do I convince systemd of that?
Aug 31 18:37:53 <ThothCastel>	omero: you would be surprised as to the amount of networks in the uk still reliant on nagios as a monitoring tool
Aug 31 18:38:03 <calious>	akk: grep -r "tty" /etc/systemd
Aug 31 18:38:46 <akk>	systemctl list-units | grep graphic lists graphical.target loaded active active Graphical Interface
Aug 31 18:39:09 <omero>	I was using nagios+cacti ThothCastel some very long time ago to monitor a ... *cough* a lab full of different things... I'm surprised it's still around :D
Aug 31 18:39:26 <akk>	calious: That grep -r doesn't print anything
Aug 31 18:39:34 <phogg>	nagios and cacti at the same time?
Aug 31 18:41:03 <omero>	as a joke, ThothCastel ... team developed a sort of 'ack/ack' salute... NAGIOS! ... CACTI!
Aug 31 18:41:16 <jim>	ThothCastel, sure... probably the package is inherited from debian
Aug 31 18:42:07 <omero>	phogg, at the time... where was a bit of ... naiveness ;D
Aug 31 18:42:17 <eviladmin>	akk: switch to the multi-user.target instead
Aug 31 18:42:21 <hexnewbie>	akk: From what I can tell, /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ should contain a getty.target symlink, and /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/ should contain a getty@tty1.service symlink.
Aug 31 18:42:39 <phogg>	omero: Sure. I never saw the point in cacti, since it's just nagios plus some infighting
Aug 31 18:43:04 <akk>	eviladmin: I found: https://www.systutorials.com/239880/change-systemd-boot-target-linux/ but trying systemctl enable multi-user.target gives a message that it has no installation config and is not meant to be enabled.
Aug 31 18:43:35 <eviladmin>	akk: which distro is this?
Aug 31 18:43:38 <akk>	eviladmin: lubuntu
Aug 31 18:43:41 <akik>	akk: use systemctl set-default if you want to change the target
Aug 31 18:43:45 <eviladmin>	version?
Aug 31 18:44:04 <akk>	The current one, 19.04 disco dingo
Aug 31 18:44:10 <omero>	well... phogg ... much water has flowed under the bridges since then ... at the time it seemed like one could complement what the other was still missing?
Aug 31 18:44:14 <akk>	I'll try set-default
Aug 31 18:44:23 <hexnewbie>	graphical.target should require multi-user.target explicitly
Aug 31 18:44:33 <akk>	It let me do set-default, so I'll try rebooting.
Aug 31 18:44:37 <eviladmin>	hexnewbie: he don't want a dm, so should use multi-user.target instead
Aug 31 18:44:54 <omero>	but nagios was indeed the 'primary' and 'cacti' the 'complementar'
Aug 31 18:45:00 <akk>	she, but yeah
Aug 31 18:45:26 <omero>	it just sent a shiver down my spine hearing 'nagios' again ^^
Aug 31 18:45:32 <akk>	Yes! That was what it needed, I have a prompt.
Aug 31 18:45:38 <akk>	Thanks for all the help, eviladmin!
Aug 31 18:47:47 *	eviladmin does have tty1 even when using graphical.target with no dm enabled though
Aug 31 18:47:53 <jim>	yeah, thanks for satisfying my curiousity
Aug 31 18:48:02 <eviladmin>	it's a bit strange that it didn't work as expected for you
Aug 31 18:48:06 <phogg>	Why wouldn't you always have tty1?
Aug 31 18:48:27 <akk>	I don't know, but I found one very unspecific page saying there was special logic.
Aug 31 18:48:28 *	eviladmin would not be surprised if some sysv comability mess is involved
Aug 31 18:49:58 <akk>	Not directly related, but this reminds me of something I tried once and failed: any way to get it not to clear the screen before printing the login prompt?
Aug 31 18:50:42 <Blondie101010>	that would be a security risk
Aug 31 18:50:47 <eviladmin>	override the unit and add a -j
Aug 31 18:50:54 <akk>	Sometimes there are error messages during boot that get cleared a millisecond after printing them, frustrating to have them disappear.
Aug 31 18:51:00 <eviladmin>	-J even
Aug 31 18:51:04 <phogg>	Blondie101010: not really; I've used distros that boot to a login prompt, leaving the boot messages just above (no clearing)
Aug 31 18:51:18 <Blondie101010>	it doesn't remove the small security risk
Aug 31 18:51:19 <phogg>	akk: supposedly systemd solves that problem
Aug 31 18:51:19 <eviladmin>	akk: just read them from journalctl / systemctl instead
Aug 31 18:51:30 <phogg>	Blondie101010: what's the risk?
Aug 31 18:51:44 <Blondie101010>	it's not uncommon for people to type their password in the login prompt
Aug 31 18:52:05 <Blondie101010>	so a small risk
Aug 31 18:52:11 <phogg>	Blondie101010: and having text from boot on the screen at that time is a risk because...?
Aug 31 18:52:20 <eviladmin>	systemctl --failed if it was an actual failed unit
Aug 31 18:52:25 <eviladmin>	else journalctl -b
Aug 31 18:52:27 <Blondie101010>	not related to the boot text
Aug 31 18:52:40 <akk>	Blondie101010: It doesn't solve that problem -- if you try logging in and fail, it doesn't clear the screen before the next prompt.
Aug 31 18:52:50 <phogg>	Blondie101010: not clearing out what was there before doesn't make the typed password more or less insecure
Aug 31 18:52:51 <Blondie101010>	ahhh ok
Aug 31 18:53:07 <akk>	oh, weird, now that I'm up in X from tty1, ctrl-alt-f2 doesn't take me to tty2. That's annoying.
Aug 31 18:53:24 <Blondie101010>	phogg:  yes it does but apparently I relied ona a bad assumption
Aug 31 18:53:41 <eviladmin>	akk: your distro might disable vtswtiching
Aug 31 18:53:55 <phogg>	akk: I had to modify startx to make it prefer tty7
Aug 31 18:54:11 <phogg>	these days it takes the first "unused" tty
Aug 31 18:54:33 <eviladmin>	phogg: reuses the tty you run it from if you run rootless
Aug 31 18:54:49 <akk>	I'm fine with it using tty1 instead of tty7, but sometimes I need tty2, like if X locks up
Aug 31 18:54:57 <phogg>	eviladmin: Sure. Still damnably irritating.
Aug 31 18:55:08 <phogg>	akk: so use tt3 instead
Aug 31 18:55:12 <phogg>	tty3*
Aug 31 18:55:40 <eviladmin>	grep -R DontVTSwitch /etc/X11/
Aug 31 18:55:53 <akk>	Oh, weird, ctl-alt-f2 and f3 didn't work, but then I tried f4 and it did work
Aug 31 18:55:59 <akk>	and after that f2 and f3 worked too
Aug 31 18:57:04 <akk>	(nothing about DontVTSwitch in /etc/X11)
Aug 31 18:57:20 <phogg>	akk: it's off by default, you would have to add a DontVTSwitch "on" stanza
Aug 31 18:57:35 <phogg>	er: Option "DontVTSwitch" "on"
Aug 31 18:57:52 <akk>	Apparently I don't have that, anyway.
Aug 31 18:59:51 <akk>	If I ctrl-alt-f2 or ctrl-alt-f2 from X, nothing happens. If I ctrl-alt-f4, I get a tty. If I then ctrl-alt-f2 or f3 from there, I still see a login prompt
Aug 31 19:00:06 <afidegnum>	programming
Aug 31 19:00:20 <akk>	and they're f2 and f3, not f4
Aug 31 19:00:25 <akk>	but I can't get to them from X
Aug 31 19:00:42 <akk>	(tty2 and tty3, not tty4)
Aug 31 19:00:46 <eviladmin>	maybe something highjacking the keys in X
Aug 31 19:01:07 <afidegnum>	I have this issue... "change this kernel variable t allow Perf to collect information without root priviledges"  sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'   where do i set that ?
Aug 31 19:01:10 <phogg>	akk: fire up xev and see if it notices the keystrokes?
Aug 31 19:01:11 <esselfe>	my bot is now able to display city weather! I'm so happy, it took me a while to get the proper sed, but I got it right
Aug 31 19:01:21 <esselfe>	thanks to wttr.in
Aug 31 19:01:25 <de-facto>	can i grow my rootfs ext4 partition online?
Aug 31 19:01:26 <phogg>	afidegnum: from the command line
Aug 31 19:02:30 <phogg>	de-facto: ext4 should support online grow OK, but not online shrink
Aug 31 19:02:35 <akk>	In xev, it sees keystrokes for ctrl, alt, f2. If I release f2 and hit f4, it immediately switches (xev doesn't block that)
Aug 31 19:02:52 <akk>	so I think the event is happening at a lower level than X (but not for f2 and f3)
Aug 31 19:02:54 <phogg>	akk: when you switch back do you see the f4 in the xev output?
Aug 31 19:03:04 <phogg>	ah wait nevermind
Aug 31 19:03:17 <phogg>	yeah, so xev reports f2 and X refuses to switch
Aug 31 19:03:33 <eviladmin>	X is the level that does the vt switching
Aug 31 19:03:33 <akk>	No, the last key is Alt_L, and then I see a VisibilityNotify and several Exposes.
Aug 31 19:03:52 <eviladmin>	inb4badaltkey
Aug 31 19:04:16 <akk>	oh, wait, that was the release for the Alt-L., higher up I see XF86Switch_VT_4, so yes, I do see the key.
Aug 31 19:04:17 <de-facto>	phogg, my root ext4 is almost full and i want to delete /dev/sda2 to grow /dev/sda1 to use almost full disk. its msdos primary ext4 is it possible to do that while its booted or should i use an usb stick?
Aug 31 19:04:35 <pitch>	is there a standard location for kernelpanic dumps?
Aug 31 19:04:52 <eviladmin>	pitch: no
Aug 31 19:05:15 <eviladmin>	pitch: you can with some gotchas, push them into nvram if you are using uefi though
Aug 31 19:05:19 <phogg>	de-facto: presuming sda2 starts at the next block after sda1 ends, just delete sda2 and grow sda1 over that size, then resize2fs on sda1
Aug 31 19:05:37 <akk>	For the F2, I see keycode 68, keysym 0x0, NoSymbol.
Aug 31 19:05:37 <eviladmin>	pitch: else: good luck getting to them if you don't have a serial console hooked up
Aug 31 19:06:00 <eviladmin>	pitch: I'm assuming actual kernel panicks, the blinking caps and scroll lock kind
Aug 31 19:06:20 <pitch>	i remember that coredumps were placed in /var/crash/ a long time ago...
Aug 31 19:06:48 <pitch>	eviladmin: problem is. there is no capslock or anything hooked iup. just ssh
Aug 31 19:06:55 <phogg>	pitch: it's config dependent, usually set by distro
Aug 31 19:07:22 <pitch>	cant i force sysctl to dump when panicking?
Aug 31 19:07:35 <eviladmin>	when the kernel panics, nothing works
Aug 31 19:07:49 <eviladmin>	pitch: coredumps are not kernel panics
Aug 31 19:09:05 <pitch>	okay, i keep getting kernelpanics when reading from a certain HDD. so in order to fix i want to see what exactly lets my kernel panic. any hints?
Aug 31 19:09:52 <eviladmin>	pitch: for those: sysctl  kernel.core_pattern
Aug 31 19:10:08 <eviladmin>	coredumps that is
Aug 31 19:10:25 <eviladmin>	pitch: sounds like a bad disk?
Aug 31 19:10:50 <eviladmin>	pitch: if you want easier debugging: pass the disk to a qemu guest and see if you can reproduce it
Aug 31 19:11:00 <eviladmin>	without the host dying
Aug 31 19:11:12 <eviladmin>	if you can, then you can access the full memory etc
Aug 31 19:11:15 <pitch>	eviladmin: thanks. ill do so and tell the results
Aug 31 19:11:32 <eviladmin>	I would just replace the disk though....
Aug 31 19:11:48 <eviladmin>	but test if it is the port or the disk first of course
Aug 31 19:11:56 <Blondie101010>	there are too many unclarified possibilities
Aug 31 19:18:41 <Gustavo6046>	I realized my physical sound device wasn't plugged to begin with... >_>
Aug 31 19:21:30 <eviladmin>	common mistake
Aug 31 19:23:38 <kokokon>	peer distributed search engine , does it exist?
Aug 31 19:25:16 <cluelessperson>	yay, mirroring 75 repositories
Aug 31 19:25:32 <cluelessperson>	I need a script for gitea that mirrors entire users and organizations from github
Aug 31 19:25:49 <kokokon>	xunil pros here?
Aug 31 19:31:34 <blueyed>	kokokon: https://yacy.net/en/index.html ?
Aug 31 19:32:11 <Gustavo6046>	eviladmin: it should still have worked. I guess virt just doesn't want to work with PulseAudio.
Aug 31 19:44:18 <Pseudonosaur>	> tfw learning Nix/Guix is too hard so you spend 100 hours writing a shit ton of shell scripts to compile your packages from source
Aug 31 19:45:17 <noahmg123>	Is there a way to see what CUPS is doing in the background when trying to authenticate with a Samba print share? I've been stuck on this authentication issue for a few days. I get four errors in quick succession in the CUPS error log. If I knew what exactly what CUPS did which resulted in them, that would be helpful.
Aug 31 19:46:16 <RayTracer>	noahmg123: you probably could use strace
Aug 31 19:46:34 <noahmg123>	RayTracer: sounds interesting. Can you elaborate?
Aug 31 19:47:18 <RayTracer>	noahmg123: strace traces syscalls, use -p to specify pid
Aug 31 19:47:30 <noahmg123>	Nice, thank you
Aug 31 19:48:20 <srk>	Pseudonosaur: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nix/
Aug 31 19:49:03 <de-facto>	phogg, it worked, though i was afraid to do it online so i booted another disk and did the resize offline :P
Aug 31 19:49:26 <RayTracer>	noahmg123: you probably want to use -f as well, as cupsd likely forks
Aug 31 19:49:37 <noahmg123>	Ok, will do
Aug 31 19:51:25 <noahmg123>	Welp, that's a lot of calls. Gotta scroll through them and see what's up
Aug 31 19:54:46 <RayTracer>	noahmg123: if you suspect that the issue is maybe in a library call, use ltrace to trace them
Aug 31 19:55:20 <noahmg123>	It's some crappy authentication issue
Aug 31 19:55:39 <noahmg123>	Not sure if whatever it is is unsupported or if CUPS is acting up
Aug 31 19:56:14 <noahmg123>	Trying to print to an Active Directory printer. It doesn't like me.
Aug 31 19:56:31 <RayTracer>	I'm not really into the workings of samba+cups, but I guess auth is already handled by samba when cups comes into play
Aug 31 19:57:40 <noahmg123>	Yeah, the errors are samba related. But I don't understand why CUPS isn't working. I can login and print directly with smbclient.
Aug 31 20:00:12 <RayTracer>	noahmg123: you maybe could try to print directly to the printer, using ipp or eg. hplip; that's what I do in a company because that's faster than trying to integrate into their windows printing infrastructure
Aug 31 20:00:39 <noahmg123>	Does IPP support authentication?
Aug 31 20:01:02 <noahmg123>	Because the jobs need to be authenticated, or they just get rejected by the server
Aug 31 20:01:38 <noahmg123>	CUPS holds the print jobs for authentication but only gives me a "negotiate" prompt when trying to authenticate it.
Aug 31 20:01:40 <RayTracer>	I don't know, I just wanted to get a printout and therefore I directly contacted the printer via tcp/hplip - no server in the game
Aug 31 20:01:50 <noahmg123>	Interesting
Aug 31 20:03:51 <RayTracer>	not suited for the secure printing feature they offer with their official printing infrastructure, but I don't really need that
Aug 31 20:12:32 <brutser>	if i boot to grub rescue and i try to cryptomount, it only creates (proc) but how do i continue to boot and how can i know if the decryption of the rootfs was successful?
Aug 31 20:12:41 <brutser>	i see no confirmation message or anything
Aug 31 20:20:37 <warsoul>	anybody knows a good and stable shell or irc vps services provider>?
Aug 31 20:20:54 <Dagmar>	If you can mount it because it actually exists in an orderly fashion as opposed to being indistinguishable from random noise, then you were successful
Aug 31 20:21:27 <Dagmar>	Any more formal way would simply serve to weaken the encryption
Aug 31 20:23:00 <Wafficus>	Hi there everyone, question about Emacs on Windows. I know, I know, I don't want to be using Windows either but my Linux laptop is in a different state for a month, so I have to use a Windows laptop in the time being. I tried to do the following steps, but can't find either "Emmet" or the "MELPA" repo: M-x package-list-packages
Aug 31 20:24:16 <eviladmin>	warsoul: forget shells, just get a cheap vps from hetzner or lowendbox listings
Aug 31 20:24:31 <eviladmin>	or just host at home
Aug 31 20:24:46 <warsoul>	eviladmin are they stable?
Aug 31 20:25:26 <eviladmin>	yes

Aug 31 20:28:50 <xiculan>	hello, i need to install ubuntu 17, It's possible to have it updated in this version?
Aug 31 20:28:54 <Dagmar>	Use larger fans, not louder fans
Aug 31 20:29:03 <Dagmar>	xiculan: No.
Aug 31 20:29:52 <Dagmar>	16 gets you as far as April of 2021.  17 is not an LTS release
Aug 31 20:29:59 <Dagmar>	Use 18.04 already
Aug 31 20:30:05 <Gustavo6046>	Dagmar: how about having the motherboard, then right beside it a big parallel fan, instead of having a small, perpendicular fan?
Aug 31 20:30:19 <Dagmar>	If there's some package you just MUST have that only works with 17, hassle that developer about actually targeting an LTS platform
Aug 31 20:30:39 <xiculan>	I need to install a sofware surveillance shinobi, and they say that it works in 17 version
Aug 31 20:30:50 <Dagmar>	Gustavo6046: If you have to ask that question, you probably shouldn't be using a screwdriver on expensive computer equipment
Aug 31 20:31:05 <Dagmar>	Notably, there is no mention of how the HEAT SINK is involed
Aug 31 20:31:17 <Dagmar>	Just blowing air across a CPU will fail, and quickly.
Aug 31 20:31:45 <Gustavo6046>	I never mentioned I was doing it.
Aug 31 20:31:47 <Gustavo6046>	It was just an idea.
Aug 31 20:32:06 <Dagmar>	xiculan: So install it on 18 and see what happens
Aug 31 20:32:12 <tds>	xiculan: "It is recommended to install a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 for the Operating System before beginning" in the docs for it I see here
Aug 31 20:32:26 <tds>	thought the readme does look out of date, yeah
Aug 31 20:32:27 <Dagmar>	xiculan: It should generally work without a _huge_ hassle, since it looks like it's all written in node
Aug 31 20:33:26 <Dagmar>	xiculan: 18.04 will be supported until April 2023
Aug 31 20:33:31 <xiculan>	ok so i'll try on 18.04 thanks a lot :)
Aug 31 20:33:39 <Dagmar>	That should be plenty of time to plan an update to Ubuntu 20
Aug 31 20:33:52 <Dagmar>	If you wait until 22, you'll probably be sorry
Aug 31 20:34:13 <Dagmar>	Since 14 I've not had a problem with in-place upgrading between LTS releases
Aug 31 20:34:21 <Dagmar>	...and that includes at least one "double-jump"
Aug 31 20:34:40 <Dagmar>	(Customer had backups and said "go for it")
Aug 31 20:35:27 <Dagmar>	Gustavo6046: Keep in mind that it's almost never just the _one_ fan
Aug 31 20:35:53 <Dagmar>	Gustavo6046: If the box itself has no airflow in and out (and particularly _through_) then all it's doing is probably pushing heat in a circl
Aug 31 20:35:55 <yokowka>	heavenO everysoul! how to live wallpapers in debian 10 install?
Aug 31 20:36:35 <Dagmar>	Gustavo6046: Most people will be best served by slightly _higher_ CFM fans for inflow and outflow than any HSF on the GPU or CPU
Aug 31 20:36:43 <MrAureliusR>	yokowka, might be worth asking in #debian
Aug 31 20:36:54 <Dagmar>	...which is where it's good to know about large, low-rotational-speed fans that don't make a whole lotta noise
Aug 31 20:37:18 <Dagmar>	The worst bloody thing is to get inflow and outflow mismatched, so that you're pulling air in through the optical drive
Aug 31 20:37:44 <Dagmar>	...or as a real nightmare scenario, fighting with whatever airflow is meant to happen with the PSU
Aug 31 20:37:54 <yokowka>	MrAureliusR, there no answer....
Aug 31 20:38:05 <MrAureliusR>	just be patient :) it can take a while
Aug 31 20:38:18 <MrAureliusR>	Dagmar, most modern PSUs and cases have separate airflow for the PSU
Aug 31 20:38:25 <MrAureliusR>	it sucks from the bottom of case and vents out the back
Aug 31 20:38:35 <Dagmar>	If the PSU has both the fan on teh rear and one on the "bottom" that "bottom" needs to face the CPU, and then you should probably have an inflow blowing air towards the CPU
Aug 31 20:39:24 <Dagmar>	MrAureliusR: Yeah but I see people on the regular making a terrible mistake by either ignoring that the PSU is definitely an outflow and not supplying enough inflow to matter
Aug 31 20:39:40 <Dagmar>	...or goign way off the deep end and just having all the fans blow out
Aug 31 20:39:45 <Dagmar>	...or in.
Aug 31 20:40:29 <Dagmar>	A good rule of thumb is in from the front and bottom, and out through the top & rear, but it's only a rule of thumb
Aug 31 20:41:08 <Dagmar>	Fans that are fighting each other make more noise, wear out faster, and are just plain inefficient
Aug 31 20:41:14 <MrAureliusR>	I mean there are benefits and drawbacks to both positive and negative pressure
Aug 31 20:41:26 <Dagmar>	negative pressure will eat your optical drive
Aug 31 20:41:27 <Dagmar>	;)
Aug 31 20:41:39 <MrAureliusR>	that's not universally true by any stretch
Aug 31 20:41:48 <MrAureliusR>	I've never once had an issue with negative pressure and optical drives personally
Aug 31 20:42:00 <Dagmar>	Unless you're maintaining a dust-free environment, air coming in throught he optical drive is going to mean dirt and residue _in_ the optical drive
Aug 31 20:42:29 <Dagmar>	Depending on how much dust is in the environment, that could mean it'll suffer a slow death in just a couple years
Aug 31 20:42:30 <mikst>	optical drive though
Aug 31 20:42:37 <knstn>	case with air-filters
Aug 31 20:42:43 <MrAureliusR>	the extremely small amount of air that would even try to get in through the optical drive, when there are many other paths with less resistance, I can't imagine would cause issues
Aug 31 20:43:09 <mikst>	haven't had one since... 8 years ago
Aug 31 20:43:10 <MrAureliusR>	air isn't going to take the more restricted path in almost all cases. maybe a tiny amount of flow
Aug 31 20:43:31 <MrAureliusR>	they are still handy to have. I like burning CDs for my dad, and burning blu-rays to back stuff up
Aug 31 20:44:04 <Dagmar>	mikst: I tend to be pretty picky since "passive airflow" cases tend to do great job of just letting the noise out, and I only seldom use the bluray burners so I'd like them to last
Aug 31 20:44:15 <knstn>	why not usb?
Aug 31 20:44:25 <Gustavo6046>	CMake can't find backtrace in a Cygwin environment.
Aug 31 20:44:37 <Dagmar>	Someone can be sloppy about airflow if a case has giant mesh windows to let the noise out
Aug 31 20:44:38 <Gustavo6046>	At least not using x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang.
Aug 31 20:44:46 <Gustavo6046>	I haven't tried another choice.
Aug 31 20:45:21 <mikst>	MrAureliusR: there was a cool paper how paper will always be a thing because digital medium changes so fast you can't rely on floppy/optical/tape reader being around
Aug 31 20:45:48 <MrAureliusR>	I suppose. but I'm not trying to archive my stuff for future generations
Aug 31 20:45:49 <Dagmar>	I'm not backing up 50Gb to paper
Aug 31 20:45:51 <Tassium>	mikst: You don't see the conflict of interest there?
Aug 31 20:45:55 <Dagmar>	There's not enough room in my hosue
Aug 31 20:45:59 <MrAureliusR>	in most cases the 50-100 year life for optical disks is fine
Aug 31 20:46:08 <Tassium>	mikst: A *paper* saying how *paper* is going to be around? I'M ON TO YOU, BIG LUMBER
Aug 31 20:46:15 <Dagmar>	The newer M-disc medium looks like it'll blow past 100 years
Aug 31 20:46:58 <mikst>	Tassium: !!!
Aug 31 20:48:20 <Dagmar>	Optical media is stable enough until someone develops equally stable solid-state media
Aug 31 20:48:39 <Dagmar>	As it stands now a 20 year old flash drive is a bad bed
Aug 31 20:48:41 <Dagmar>	er bet
Aug 31 20:48:55 <Dagmar>	...at least, if its' been sitting on a shelf the whole 20 years
Aug 31 20:49:09 <Gustavo6046>	I guess Cygwin doesn't support backtrace(3). Too bad, I can't compile GZDoom for Windows that way, then... I'll just use native tools.
Aug 31 20:49:33 <xqdzn>	guys, i'm compiling new kernel, manually, should generate initramfs as well?
Aug 31 20:49:45 <mikst>	Dagmar: yeah, you can't backup childhood videos on paper either, the point is "passive" backup is inherently flawed, and you kinda stuck maintaining live backup box
Aug 31 20:49:52 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: Would you like to actually be able to _use_ this shiny new kernel?
Aug 31 20:50:09 <Dagmar>	mikst: Thats' why we go for optical media right now
Aug 31 20:50:19 <Dagmar>	If you're really invested, m-disc
Aug 31 20:50:30 <xqdzn>	Dagmar it's for learning purpose.
Aug 31 20:50:37 <Dagmar>	You just have to be ready to evacuate that data ot a newer media once it's developed
Aug 31 20:50:53 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: So you just intend to admire it from a distance?
Aug 31 20:51:35 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: Here's the deal.  If you want a truly modular, nice and slender kernel, if will only contain the modules that are _needed_ for bootstrapping
Aug 31 20:51:40 <msiism>	The really important sruff should probably go on Golden Records...
Aug 31 20:51:45 <msiism>	stuff*
Aug 31 20:52:02 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: ...which means you need mainly support for module loading and whatever filesystem you used on your initrd
Aug 31 20:52:14 <Dagmar>	Analog?  No.
Aug 31 20:52:40 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: That kernel will have just enough smarts to get at the initrd, where it will get _the rest_ of the modules needed to continue booting
Aug 31 20:53:07 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: If you're not going to use an initrd, then your booting kernel needs support for your disk controller, and all the filesystems necessary to getting at /li/modules
Aug 31 20:53:39 <xqdzn>	meaning, i need ramfs?
Aug 31 20:53:58 <Dagmar>	xqdzn: This also becomes a liability, because what if you take that hard drive and put it on some other machine with a different and incompatible disk controller chipset?
Aug 31 20:54:03 <VladTheImplier>	I fullscreen QEMU. How the hell do I exit fullscreen =.=
Aug 31 20:54:10 <Dagmar>	The thing isn't going to boot there.
Aug 31 20:54:19 <Dagmar>	(This used to be a much bigger deal)
Aug 31 20:54:53 <Dagmar>	Going the initrd route, the primary bootstrap (i.e., grub) is the thing that has to worry about getting the kernel and initrd from disk
Aug 31 20:55:13 <Dagmar>	Then you can just throw kitchensink.ko into the initrd
Aug 31 20:55:51 <Dagmar>	the kernel will load whatever modeuls it needs from the initrd, based on what hardware it's seeing, just like God and LInus intended
Aug 31 20:56:10 <pepite>	hello every body
Aug 31 20:56:25 <Dagmar>	Anywat, even Slackware comes with a shell script to build a respectable initrd
Aug 31 20:56:28 <pepite>	there are dev android here ?
Aug 31 20:56:57 <Dagmar>	pepite: We only allow _production_ Androids in this channel.  Too many killing sprees, you see.
Aug 31 20:57:04 <VladTheImplier>	pepite: >> #android
Aug 31 20:57:10 <xqdzn>	I'm compiling kernel for an arm board. Need to do some patches to make thermal driver work, and to enable some devices, so i managed to generate: zImage, dtbs, modules. And managed to copy those files to board's sdcard. Managed to boot. But it seems modules are not detected (?)
Aug 31 20:57:25 <pepite>	ok thank you
Aug 31 20:57:43 <Dagmar>	xqdzn; Then you need to put more stuff into the kernel _not_ as modules, until you can get the kernel booting with an initrd
Aug 31 20:58:12 <Dagmar>	Take a look at what RASpbian is doing, per example
Aug 31 20:58:55 <xqdzn>	is "mkinitcpio -k linux-5.3.0-rc6-CUSTOM -g /boot/initramfs-linux.img" enough?
Aug 31 20:59:47 <Dagmar>	_Probably_
Aug 31 21:00:08 <Dagmar>	You might want to go back to basics on this and consult https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/initrd.html or read the man page for mkinitcpio
Aug 31 21:00:44 <Dagmar>	I generally use Slackware, where I"m either using their script, or i'm doing it like that HOWTO says because that's how long I've been doing this, or I'm using dracut and obscenities
Aug 31 21:00:48 <xqdzn>	aight, thank you so much Dagmar
Aug 31 21:01:00 <Dagmar>	...because dracut is "automatic" and occasionally fails horribly.
Aug 31 21:01:26 <Dagmar>	Sometimes it decides things like, no one really needs RAID drivers
Aug 31 21:01:47 <xqdzn>	I used slack, arch, debian. But all these times, i rely on their script and packages.
Aug 31 21:01:49 <Dagmar>	...or, "since you've booted from a recovery CD, we'll build the new initrd for that!"
Aug 31 21:02:59 <Dagmar>	Well, if it works, _steal_
Aug 31 21:03:07 <Dagmar>	Read the scripts they're using
Aug 31 21:03:20 <xqdzn>	when i see nothing from $lsmod, is that means i have no module loadable and/or loaded?
Aug 31 21:03:30 <Dagmar>	No one's going to get upset because you actually read the comments in their scritps
Aug 31 21:03:53 <Dagmar>	yes, if lsmod turns up nothing, it could be broken, but asteroids could also be about to hit your house
Aug 31 21:03:59 <Dagmar>	It's a safe bet modules are all missing
Aug 31 21:04:34 <VladTheImplier>	Does someone now how to leave Fullscreen in QEMU?
Aug 31 21:05:05 <Dagmar>	drat.  I've been lazy.  i gotta go make sure Google can still see my installkernel script
Aug 31 21:05:24 <Tassium>	VladTheImplier: A quick look at google suggests control-alt-f
Aug 31 21:05:41 <VladTheImplier>	Tassium: Uff, the I read the wrong info in their doc
Aug 31 21:05:42 <VladTheImplier>	thanks
Aug 31 21:05:56 <VladTheImplier>	Tassium: Worked, must have mixed up QEMU's doc
Aug 31 21:06:11 <mystic>	rod hull & emu
Aug 31 21:06:50 <Tassium>	Emu is my hero
Aug 31 21:08:58 <mystic>	'stop it emu!'
Aug 31 21:11:08 <FMan>	"Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check." occurs if I try to attach a screen after su'ing to another user
Aug 31 21:12:01 <danieldg>	that's because of how screen wants to work
Aug 31 21:12:12 <danieldg>	you just can't use screen after su'ing
Aug 31 21:13:03 <danieldg>	there are a few possible workarounds (systemd-run --pty is a quick one, as is sshing to the user instead of suing)
Aug 31 21:13:10 <akik>	FMan: did you use "su - username" ?
Aug 31 21:13:21 <danieldg>	akik: it's a screen bug, not a su bug
Aug 31 21:13:42 <FMan>	no
Aug 31 21:13:52 <mikst>	FMan: have you tried chmod?
Aug 31 21:14:00 <FMan>	no
Aug 31 21:14:08 <danieldg>	you could use tmux instead, it doesn't have this problem
Aug 31 21:14:19 <mikst>	FMan: I guess you could
Aug 31 21:14:40 <FMan>	so, it's a know bug, which I remember from about 35 years ago and it has not been fixed...
Aug 31 21:14:54 <danieldg>	FMan: it's been fixed by "use tmux" :)
Aug 31 21:14:59 <FMan>	lol
Aug 31 21:15:27 <FMan>	I am unfamiliar with it, but I suppose I could look into it
Aug 31 21:15:38 <danieldg>	FMan: or having your uid change also include a new PTY, like ssh or systemd-run does
Aug 31 21:15:44 <akik>	danieldg: there's no problem attaching to other user's screen after running "su - otheruser"
Aug 31 21:16:16 <msiism>	Random person talked into switching to Linux by ethusiast: “This is a nightmare. You promised I was gonna be just fine on Linux. But I don't know how to do anything on that freaking command-line.” Ethusiast: “Please don't su.”
Aug 31 21:16:26 <Wafficus>	what's the best stable terminal only Linux distro?
Aug 31 21:16:40 <danieldg>	akik: are you sure? the tty is still owned by the original user at that point
Aug 31 21:16:53 <sauvin>	Wafficus, "best" by what kind of yardstick?
Aug 31 21:16:53 <akik>	danieldg: oh you're a tmux bigot
Aug 31 21:17:02 <SlowJimmy>	Wafficus: Debian
Aug 31 21:17:12 <msiism>	SlowJimmy: prove it. :p
Aug 31 21:17:17 <Wafficus>	well, stable in that I don't want to maintain a daily build like Arch
Aug 31 21:17:22 <akik>	danieldg: yes i just tested it
Aug 31 21:17:23 <SlowJimmy>	msiism it's a self-evident
Aug 31 21:17:27 <Wafficus>	just something where I can use it day to day without fear of blowing it up
Aug 31 21:17:36 <sauvin>	Yeah. Debian.
Aug 31 21:17:36 <msiism>	SlowJimmy: not in the lsightest.
Aug 31 21:18:21 <SlowJimmy>	msiism: how could you be so naive, don't believe what the elites want you to believe, Debian is where it's at
Aug 31 21:18:34 <Tassium>	Wafficus: I use ubuntu-server without any issues. Devuan is Debian without systemd, if that matters to you.
Aug 31 21:19:41 <msiism>	SlowJimmy: What do you mean by that? Who are the elites? Are you part of an elite? I'm confused.
Aug 31 21:20:04 <pitch>	Wafficus: i am on void as a daily driver. very basic OS with rolling release. if something blows up its all yours. because there isnt much to blow up from the start
Aug 31 21:20:20 <danieldg>	akik: huh, looks like they fixed that bug then
Aug 31 21:20:39 <sauvin>	Warning: there appears to be no such thing as a stable rolling release distro.
Aug 31 21:20:45 <danieldg>	akik: sorry, it was broken last I used screen, working from old data here
Aug 31 21:20:45 <SlowJimmy>	msiism: I don't know the answer to any of those questions but I do know debian is what Wafficus wants
Aug 31 21:20:57 <Wafficus>	pitch Sweet, good to know. I'll look at that too
Aug 31 21:21:03 <msiism>	SlowJimmy: I see.
Aug 31 21:21:07 <Wafficus>	pitch I know Luke Smith supports that a ton instead of Arch these days
Aug 31 21:21:11 <danieldg>	akik: the error message implies that FMan is using an unfixed version, of course...
Aug 31 21:21:20 <akik>	danieldg: i use screen only through an ssh connection to a server so i'm not 100% sure about the local usage
Aug 31 21:21:54 <danieldg>	akik: screen used to send only the name of the PTY to the master process and have that run open(), which was the cause of the bug
Aug 31 21:22:02 <pitch>	Wafficus: i would interpret void as the logical solution for not having sysd and still want to build your environment 'from scratch'
Aug 31 21:22:10 <danieldg>	it seems that it now sends the FD of the PTY instead, which is the correct thing to do
Aug 31 21:23:24 <msiism>	Wafficus: The thing is, you can run any Linux distro without a GUI.
Aug 31 21:23:53 <Dagmar>	Maybe if you don't know enough to scribble up a shell script that does sysv or bsd-style init
Aug 31 21:23:55 <SlowJimmy>	msiism: but clearly none as well as the mighty Debian
Aug 31 21:27:42 <mystic>	msiism, you'll get it, keep at it, it will all click one day & terminal will be  breeze. If you need any help im here
Aug 31 21:28:02 <msiism>	SlowJimmy: Sure, it's fun to build the cdrecord suite from source. No question about that.
Aug 31 21:28:41 <msiism>	mystic: What's the context?
Aug 31 21:28:59 <mystic>	!sarcasm
Aug 31 21:29:21 <msiism>	That's not a context.
Aug 31 21:29:32 <akik>	mystic is a joker
Aug 31 21:29:48 <akik>	allergic to the shell
Aug 31 21:29:49 <msiism>	more loke a poker.
Aug 31 21:29:54 <msiism>	like*
Aug 31 21:30:09 <mystic>	shell give me the heebeejeebees
Aug 31 21:30:15 <mystic>	brings me out in welts
Aug 31 21:30:45 <msiism>	mystic: Try the Linux port of plan9's RC shell then. It seems to be better from what I've seen.
Aug 31 21:31:09 <jim>	you gotta roll around in it, touch it, taste it, really experience it...
Aug 31 21:31:11 <mystic>	id dont know anything about that.
Aug 31 21:31:20 <mystic>	thats debauchery jim
Aug 31 21:31:46 <msiism>	mystic: What's your shell?
Aug 31 21:31:59 <jim>	probably default
Aug 31 21:32:12 <mystic>	ive never worn a shellsuit.. but im open to the idea
Aug 31 21:32:23 <FMan>	is dsh the default shell?
Aug 31 21:32:32 <mystic>	no idea
Aug 31 21:32:48 <jim>	FMan, lots of times in many linuxes, it's bash
Aug 31 21:33:00 <jim>	mystic, echo $SHELL
Aug 31 21:33:12 <msiism>	FMan: you mean dash? It's the default non-interactive shell on some systems, e.g., Debian, IIRC.
Aug 31 21:33:29 <mystic>	oh.. im in windows at moment.. terminal is out of action..
Aug 31 21:33:38 <FMan>	I guess it's a long time ago, when it the shell was just 'sh'
Aug 31 21:33:48 <Dagmar>	Very
Aug 31 21:34:21 <msiism>	FMan: Well, sh is not identical to sh, is it?
Aug 31 21:34:29 <FMan>	uh
Aug 31 21:34:29 <mystic>	i tried to learn basic when i had a commodore 64..  couldnt manage that either
Aug 31 21:34:42 <Dagmar>	That explains a lot
Aug 31 21:34:46 <FMan>	well, C64 had the worst BASIC ever
Aug 31 21:35:01 <Dagmar>	You didn't do a lot of different variants of BASIC
Aug 31 21:35:05 <Tassium>	And the best sound chip of the era
Aug 31 21:35:19 <FMan>	true
Aug 31 21:35:40 <sauvin>	Yeah, the C64's version of BASIC presented some challenges.
Aug 31 21:35:50 <mystic>	10 ?"Four track sid chip and 16 colours - take that speccy"
Aug 31 21:35:53 <mystic>	20 goto 10
Aug 31 21:36:08 <FMan>	I accidentally lied before: I have Ubuntu 16.04.3
Aug 31 21:36:10 <Dagmar>	The only challenges I ran into were that eveni tokenized, I could fill the RAM in an afternoon
Aug 31 21:36:26 <Dagmar>	I wound up coding in 6502 assembly after having mine for about six months
Aug 31 21:36:42 <sauvin>	All variables global, significant to only two characters, no structured progrmaming, no subprograms, everything was referenced by anonymous line numbers... GAH!
Aug 31 21:36:45 <Dagmar>	I have written longer _emails_ than you could do with ony about 32k space availabe
Aug 31 21:36:51 <msiism>	FMan: I mean, POSIX sh is not the same as the original Bourne shell.
Aug 31 21:36:58 <FMan>	ok
Aug 31 21:37:03 <Dagmar>	Anonymous line numbers?
Aug 31 21:37:09 <Dagmar>	You're thinking of some other version of BASIC
Aug 31 21:37:27 <Dagmar>	variables defeinitely weren't limited to two characters of uniqueness either
Aug 31 21:37:32 <mystic>	international karata plus still looks good, and plays better than some of the crap produced these days
Aug 31 21:37:38 <sauvin>	No, I'm thinking that "goto 24275" doesn't say a damn thing about what code is at 24275.
Aug 31 21:37:40 <mystic>	karate*
Aug 31 21:37:50 <Dagmar>	That's BASIC for ya
Aug 31 21:37:58 <msiism>	mystic: Maybe you should try FreeDOS.
Aug 31 21:38:00 <FMan>	well, that was all BASICs at the time
Aug 31 21:38:04 <Dagmar>	You were totally allowed to stick a variable there
Aug 31 21:38:07 <sauvin>	Dagmar, yes, they were. POTATOES was the same as POTASH. Trust me; I've hacked the variable storage stuff to bits.
Aug 31 21:38:37 <FMan>	that's true
Aug 31 21:39:01 <mystic>	i tried to type in some games from magazines.. a few pages of code.. but never worked
Aug 31 21:39:17 <Dagmar>	Bizarre.  MAybe i missed that bit because I wound up going pretty much straight to assembly
Aug 31 21:39:26 <sauvin>	That's funny... ALL the type-in stuff I tried worked very well.
Aug 31 21:39:44 <mystic>	maybe its cos 'u' never abbreviate lol
Aug 31 21:39:54 <FMan>	did you get screwed up by the control characters?
Aug 31 21:39:56 <sauvin>	Dagmar, yes, that would be why. I went halfway: bits of assembly called by the main BASIC program.
Aug 31 21:40:16 <Dagmar>	There were variants of BASIC out there that allowed for DATA statements, but with _no way to reset the pointer to the beginning_
Aug 31 21:40:29 <FMan>	someone once suggested that most people did that and that's why the C64 scene was so successful (in asm)
Aug 31 21:40:31 <Dagmar>	Those were truly evil
Aug 31 21:40:48 <sauvin>	No kidding! I can't remember if C64's basic allowed for DATA pointer reset.
Aug 31 21:40:57 <Dagmar>	It did, IIRC
Aug 31 21:41:10 <sauvin>	It was a very long time ago :(
Aug 31 21:41:13 <Dagmar>	Like, it came up as a problem for people at an ACM programming contest when I was a kid
Aug 31 21:41:16 <FMan>	ZX BASIC probably did not
Aug 31 21:41:19 <mystic>	listen to 'delta' in game soundtrack.. sounds like pink floyd..  dunno how they got that out of the sid chip
Aug 31 21:41:40 <Dagmar>	They were used to having it avialable, but a more strict interpretation was that if you had to reset the point you were probably processing teh data twice and therefore wasting CPU
Aug 31 21:41:52 <msiism>	mystic: You run Ubuntu, right?
Aug 31 21:41:57 <Tassium>	Dagmar: Yeah, in c64 the keyword was RESTORE
Aug 31 21:42:01 <mystic>	i do.  but on windwos 10 right now
Aug 31 21:42:09 <MrAureliusR>	heathen!
Aug 31 21:42:11 <MrAureliusR>	:P
Aug 31 21:42:13 <msiism>	mystic: Keep this for later then: https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/tutoriallist
Aug 31 21:42:13 <mystic>	:P
Aug 31 21:42:19 <Dagmar>	So like, one of the programming tasks like me and one other guy actually completed successfully because we had that available, but never used it after we'd been exposed to the idea that perhaps RESTORE was sloppy coding
Aug 31 21:42:20 <mystic>	ok.. i will keep it
Aug 31 21:42:32 <Dagmar>	Everyone else bombed it
Aug 31 21:42:34 <mystic>	now its working i dont mind studying a bit.. maybe... in my own time...   perhaps.. lol
Aug 31 21:42:42 <Dagmar>	Tassium: Thanks
Aug 31 21:42:51 <sauvin>	Dagmar, you ever tried the BUDDY assembler?
Aug 31 21:42:54 <Dagmar>	Nope
Aug 31 21:43:08 <sauvin>	It was interesting. You could write BASIC and assembler source in the same file.
Aug 31 21:43:17 <Dagmar>	For a short while I was literally coding my crap in hex
Aug 31 21:43:41 <FMan>	Dagmar, that sounds like goto being evil in C :)
Aug 31 21:43:42 <sauvin>	As I remember it, you could put in your BASIC code stuff like sys("MYCRAP")
Aug 31 21:44:05 <Dagmar>	I'd spent so much time not having a "decent" assembler that I'd just gotten used to seeing the opcodes in hex
Aug 31 21:44:26 <sauvin>	Heard that. I spent WAY too much time in the C128's MLM.
Aug 31 21:44:46 <FMan>	me too - it was my favorite place!
Aug 31 21:44:53 <mystic>	i wanted  128 and an amiga.. it never happened.  emulators are great though these days
Aug 31 21:45:06 <Dagmar>	If I had applied for patetns on half the stuff I was coding on the c128d I would be an extremely rich guy
Aug 31 21:45:15 <FMan>	heh
Aug 31 21:45:28 <sauvin>	No kidding. Wish I'd realised that then.
Aug 31 21:45:50 <Dagmar>	I'd written filesystems and memory managers that used the floppy drive like Linux does swap, etc etc
Aug 31 21:46:31 <Dagmar>	Was it 86 or 88 ticks
Aug 31 21:46:36 <Dagmar>	I can't remember now
Aug 31 21:46:37 <Tassium>	Why though, the 1541 was slow as shit
Aug 31 21:46:43 <sauvin>	At the time, I had no Internet, so I hadn't realised that things like Microsoft Windows was on the horizon. I'd actually started laying out a Windows-like interface in BASIC before I got a 286 and was hit in the face with an echo of all my work already done. :\
Aug 31 21:46:49 <mystic>	not as slow as my datasette lol
Aug 31 21:46:53 <Dagmar>	Tassium: It was slow by default
Aug 31 21:47:04 <Tassium>	sauvin: Did you ever get a chance to play with GEOS?
Aug 31 21:47:16 <sauvin>	Feh, that datasette. I had it for about three months and then decided "Q!@#$@%##" and saved up for a disk drive.
Aug 31 21:47:17 <Dagmar>	Tassium: You could make it faster by making some assumptions about speed and using multiple lines to the drive at once
Aug 31 21:47:26 <sauvin>	Tassium, yes, I did, and I didn't like it.
Aug 31 21:47:36 <Dagmar>	Some cartridges went crazy and used three lines
Aug 31 21:48:04 <Dagmar>	Tassium: I remember being pissed that Microsoft even had the balls to make certtain patent claims
Aug 31 21:48:17 <Dagmar>	...and that someone had to go and dig GeoWorks out of the back of their closet to show to the judge
Aug 31 21:48:20 <Tassium>	Dagmar: You and XEROX, heh
Aug 31 21:48:34 <mystic>	nothing else left to invent?  get back to it see what you can come up with
Aug 31 21:48:36 <Dagmar>	Well, Geoworks went a hell of a lot further than Xerox
Aug 31 21:49:06 <Dagmar>	Xerox mainly just had the clue that an x-y pointing device allowed for a different form of instructing the machine
Aug 31 21:49:54 <Dagmar>	When you're like 12 at that time, a whole lot of professionals would readily just show you everything simply because they were astonished a 12-year-old could keep up
Aug 31 21:50:16 <Dagmar>	I'd ahve probably gotten to see freakin' ICBMs up close if I'd asked the right people
Aug 31 21:50:46 <Dagmar>	And absolutely no one would ever admit that a 12-year old blew right through their security measures
Aug 31 21:51:13 <mystic>	they would these days.. celebrate it.   liek that stupid climate change girl  all over the news
Aug 31 21:51:18 <Tassium>	Wargames and The Manhattan Project come to mind
Aug 31 21:51:34 <Dagmar>	Yeah but Broderick was supposed to be about 18-19 in that movie
Aug 31 21:51:36 <Dagmar>	Not _12_
Aug 31 21:51:48 <Dagmar>	...and this was well before that came out

Sep 11 16:33:29 <evilscrew>	but why didnt PS work
Sep 11 16:34:42 <Thuryn>	ps probably did, but there were no processes with "auto" in their names
Sep 11 16:34:56 <Thuryn>	run just 'ps -aefww' to see all of the running processes without any filtering
Sep 11 16:36:36 <dfrantzen>	Does weathermap 0.97c for librenms work with php 7.2.19?
Sep 11 16:38:45 <evilscrew>	Thuryn: http://pastebin.com/HQxYNKmy
Sep 11 16:39:14 <evilscrew>	anything there of keen interest?
Sep 11 16:40:12 <Thuryn>	what's udisksd
Sep 11 16:41:30 <Thuryn>	or all these 'gvfs' processes?  they have things like "volume monitor" in them, which sounds to me like filesystem management
Sep 11 16:44:14 <evilscrew>	hrm not sure what those ultimately are
Sep 11 16:44:33 <Thuryn>	evilscrew, i think you should read this:  https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=240797
Sep 11 16:45:06 <Thuryn>	it's not the same exact problem you have, but it references mint's automounting process and how to mess with it.
Sep 11 16:45:10 <Thuryn>	might learn some relevant things.
Sep 11 16:59:19 <jim>	evilscrew, got a couple things... maybe take 10 minutes... wanna do that now?
Sep 11 17:02:01 <jim>	ok, no response... have to be later
Sep 11 17:07:13 <evilscrew>	jim hey
Sep 11 17:07:19 <evilscrew>	yeh lets do it now
Sep 11 17:20:33 <A4L_>	I am on debian and I want to always reboot from a shutdown (server enviroment)
Sep 11 17:20:39 <A4L_>	help
Sep 11 17:20:43 <A4L_>	please
Sep 11 17:20:50 <Thuryn>	hm
Sep 11 17:21:10 <Thuryn>	A4L_, if the server loses power, will it power back up afterward?
Sep 11 17:21:26 <Thuryn>	that setting is in BIOS
Sep 11 17:22:29 <A4L_>	no. I don't expect that. I have UPSes, but is there any possibility of rebooting from a crash? (overload...)
Sep 11 17:23:11 <Thuryn>	it's possible, i suppose.  there's a kernel watchdog that should be configurable to do that for you
Sep 11 17:23:42 <Thuryn>	https://linuxhint.com/linux-kernel-watchdog-explained/
Sep 11 17:23:53 <evilscrew>	🐶
Sep 11 17:24:10 *	Thuryn pets the watchdog... carefully...
Sep 11 17:24:34 <evilscrew>	lol watchdog kennel or watchdog *kernal*
Sep 11 17:24:55 *	Thuryn smacks that 'kernal' crap off the screen
Sep 11 17:25:05 <evilscrew>	im australian, its how we spell it here
Sep 11 17:25:39 <Thuryn>	no wai
Sep 11 17:26:05 <evilscrew>	Thuryn this usb stick btw, is the first time in my 33 year career, that ANYTHING that was solid state has failed on me
Sep 11 17:26:14 <evilscrew>	Im guessing its some sort of NAND but yeh
Sep 11 17:26:37 <evilscrew>	It happens I suppose!
Sep 11 17:26:53 <Thuryn>	oh you think the stick itself is dead?  yeah it does happen.  as you say, it's rare, but not zero.
Sep 11 17:26:57 <rud0lf>	evilscrew: you need a usb stick with a tiny plates
Sep 11 17:27:02 <rud0lf>	mini hard disk
Sep 11 17:27:12 <Thuryn>	i've only come across one that just "died" without first being run over or something.
Sep 11 17:27:14 <Thuryn>	physical abuse
Sep 11 17:27:18 *	rcf has encountered many that have died.
Sep 11 17:27:20 <evilscrew>	without a doubt. and im assuming some critical part of it is what died.
Sep 11 17:27:23 <rcf>	Especially cheaper ones.
Sep 11 17:27:30 <evilscrew>	some crucial block that data needs to pass through
Sep 11 17:27:30 <rud0lf>	RIP solid stade devices
Sep 11 17:27:45 <Thuryn>	voltage regulator, perhaps
Sep 11 17:27:45 <rcf>	The good flash goes to SSDs and the pricier USB sticks and SD cards.
Sep 11 17:27:51 <evilscrew>	i had a usb stick one that had been run over by a car. was still workinglol
Sep 11 17:27:52 <Thuryn>	that'll destroy the whole thing
Sep 11 17:28:12 <hodapp>	oh, I've had countless SD cards and USB sticks fail me
Sep 11 17:28:16 <evilscrew>	this was a sandisk ultra, so you wouldve assumed it was "high quality"
Sep 11 17:28:16 <Thuryn>	can you smell the magic smoke?
Sep 11 17:28:55 <evilscrew>	hodapp really?
Sep 11 17:29:00 <A4L_>	I am the dumbest guy ever :facepalm:  I just checked if my server reboots after a powerloss, I flipped the switch and my IRC client obviously crashed... I had IRC on that server... I have figured out that my motherboard does not support that option, thatks anyway for your help! (-;
Sep 11 17:29:08 <rcf>	On my Chromebook I use an SD card for /home and /var. It sees rather heavy use and I've had some give out after a year or so.
Sep 11 17:29:39 <Thuryn>	this makes me happy:  https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kernal
Sep 11 17:29:43 <hodapp>	one of the stranger failures I had was a CompactFlash card that was running a pfSense box. The box would start up fine, and it had a bit more RAM than needed so it would tend to run completely out of cache and rarely need to touch disk for anything. At random, the CF card would just drop off the bus altogether.
Sep 11 17:30:20 <rcf>	evilscrew: under light duty they aren't bad. Under heavy write load, they're consumables.
Sep 11 17:30:38 <hodapp>	so the system mostly kept running but certain operations would fail
Sep 11 17:30:42 <evilscrew>	without a doubt this stick is dead, ive tried several different computers, mounts then unmounts itself after 10 seconds, doesnt let me format, or even open it in explorer
Sep 11 17:30:55 <evilscrew>	hodapp and then what happened
Sep 11 17:31:20 <hodapp>	evilscrew: what happened is mostly that it took me awhile to diagnose things
Sep 11 17:31:38 <hodapp>	because normally drives don't just start fine and then drop off the bus after hours/days
Sep 11 17:32:08 <evilscrew>	CF cards were those little square things you put in DSLR cameras right?
Sep 11 17:32:12 <evilscrew>	you were using it to run a little router?
Sep 11 17:32:33 <evilscrew>	yeh, the last thing you suspect is that its just given out...
Sep 11 17:32:47 <hodapp>	CompactFlash is electrically almost identical to IDE, and CF cards tended to be more robust than SD cards
Sep 11 17:32:49 <rcf>	evilscrew: they're useful in older systems because the electrical interface is identical to parallel ATA.
Sep 11 17:32:51 <evilscrew>	makes me worried to use my other ones..
Sep 11 17:33:18 <evilscrew>	right right.... okay
Sep 11 17:33:21 <hodapp>	so, yes, it was running a router because the OS was pretty minimal and this let me run with a tiny power supply and no fans
Sep 11 17:33:33 <evilscrew>	gotchya
Sep 11 17:33:49 <evilscrew>	but its kinda like .... dragging a 20 tonne load with a porche
Sep 11 17:33:57 <evilscrew>	okay it might be able to do it given its engine is powerful
Sep 11 17:34:04 <evilscrew>	but the wear would be enourmous
Sep 11 17:34:16 <hodapp>	why would the wear be enormous?
Sep 11 17:35:03 <hodapp>	it was a router. it had more than enough RAM as to need no swap. no particularly high-velocity logs were written to disk.
Sep 11 17:35:28 <evilscrew>	i trust you
Sep 11 17:35:29 <hodapp>	99% of its writes were just manual configuration changes and very low-frequency logging
Sep 11 17:36:07 <hodapp>	things like pfSense and OpenWrt are designed around this use-case because of how often they run from flash memory
Sep 11 17:36:11 <evilscrew>	i barely used this stupid SSD tho and its official sandisk
Sep 11 17:36:57 <evilscrew>	gonna email sandisk
Sep 11 17:36:59 <Thuryn>	got a receipt?  RMA it?
Sep 11 17:37:01 <Thuryn>	yeah
Sep 11 17:37:33 <zamba>	i need to help a friend of mine with a linux server.. unfortunately he doesn't have root on the system, so he can't start sshd on it to allow me to log in.. but i believe i've seen a trick somewhere where it's possible for him to ssh to me and then we can establish some sort of tunnel back in again?
Sep 11 17:37:40 <zamba>	so i can issue commands on his system
Sep 11 17:37:45 <zamba>	is that possible? what is it called?
Sep 11 17:37:52 <evilscrew>	quantum tunnel?
Sep 11 17:38:04 <Thuryn>	autossh
Sep 11 17:38:13 <evilscrew>	shh!
Sep 11 17:38:19 <evilscrew>	sorry just being a jackass now.
Sep 11 17:38:23 *	evilscrew backs slowly into the corner
Sep 11 17:38:27 <Thuryn>	lol
Sep 11 17:38:38 <hodapp>	for a reverse tunnel to get you anywhere you still need something listening like an SSH server
Sep 11 17:38:51 <Thuryn>	true
Sep 11 17:39:04 <hodapp>	e.g. dropbear
Sep 11 17:39:12 <zamba>	hodapp: it's not possible to get the established tunnel and somehow get a reverse terminal through it?
Sep 11 17:39:23 <zamba>	hodapp: yeah, i understand that part
Sep 11 17:39:43 <hodapp>	I don't think SSH supports that on its own
Sep 11 17:40:08 <zamba>	yeah, but you need to do something with socat or similar
Sep 11 17:40:20 <hodapp>	socat can do some crazy hackery here
Sep 11 17:41:03 <hodapp>	why not acquire dropbear, run on port 2222, ssh -N -R 2222:localhost:2222 foo@bar.com, then from bar.com do 'ssh -p 2222 user@localhost'?
Sep 11 17:41:07 <Thuryn>	zamba, the ssh client can do some interesting stuff to make a service available from the outside, but it can't CREATE that service.
Sep 11 17:41:26 <Thuryn>	sshd has to be running in order to be able to tunnel to it.
Sep 11 17:44:20 <hodapp>	but if you look in the 'Examples' section of 'man socat', it has basically a poor-man's-telnet-server formula
Sep 11 17:45:14 <hodapp>	you could run that on a port (please please only bind to localhost) and then reverse-tunnel that same port from localhost to your remote host

Sep 12 10:33:41 <_ev>	grummund:   https://forum.manjaro.org/t/i915-gpu-hang-solved/37200  - maybe
Sep 12 10:37:10 <eraserpencil>	Hi I'm hoping to get the serial id of my motherboard I currently have a programme in C++ that i hardcoded "sudo cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_serial" as a cmd to parse it.
Sep 12 10:38:10 <grummund>	_ev: thanks, indeed it seems i have i915 video.
Sep 12 10:38:21 <b1tninja>	sudo cat?
Sep 12 10:38:26 <eraserpencil>	It's not a very good solution, and I'm hoping to know how /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_serial handles it. Would anyone know where i can find it's source code?
Sep 12 10:40:12 <MrElendig>	in the kernel source obviously
Sep 12 10:40:28 <eraserpencil>	oh, kernel source...
Sep 12 10:40:32 <eraserpencil>	hmmm
Sep 12 10:40:40 <MrElendig>	why not just read it off that path from C++ directly
Sep 12 10:40:41 <MrElendig>	?
Sep 12 10:40:58 <eraserpencil>	it requires root permissions?
Sep 12 10:41:05 <b1tninja>	linux/drivers/firmware/dmi-id.c
Sep 12 10:42:23 <MrElendig>	reading the info from the hardware requires root too so..
Sep 12 10:42:37 <eraserpencil>	hmmm
Sep 12 10:43:53 <eraserpencil>	what is it that makes it require root?
Sep 12 10:44:15 <MrElendig>	reading it or the sys device?
Sep 12 10:44:22 <eraserpencil>	reading it
Sep 12 10:44:47 <b1tninja>	drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c seems to be where the fun stuff happens
Sep 12 10:44:48 <MrElendig>	because it involved poking around in memory
Sep 12 10:45:13 <MrElendig>	and linux does not have fine grained access control
Sep 12 10:46:41 <eraserpencil>	so no way around requiring root permissions huh
Sep 12 10:47:06 <b1tninja>	DEFINE_DMI_ATTR_WITH_SHOW(board_serial, 0400, DMI_BOARD_SERIAL);
Sep 12 10:47:32 <b1tninja>	the 0400 could be changed
Sep 12 10:48:39 <MrElendig>	probably don't want to though, it is a source of information leak after all
Sep 12 10:49:22 <eraserpencil>	hmmmm
Sep 12 10:50:04 <MrElendig>	could use acl or polkit to grant access though
Sep 12 10:50:05 <b1tninja>	and not useful if you're trying to make some tool that runs on other peoples machines
Sep 12 10:51:26 <MrElendig>	what are you actually trying to achieve?
Sep 12 10:51:39 <b1tninja>	i think he asked about uniquely identifying systems earlier
Sep 12 10:51:49 <MrElendig>	that is what machine-id is for
Sep 12 10:52:23 <b1tninja>	i suggested smbios id, cpuid, mac addr, serial numbers, /etc/machine-id [sometimes not unique if cloned]
Sep 12 10:52:55 <eraserpencil>	just a homemade licensing system. I was experimenting with CPUID, but i realise if its an identical cpu model, then it fails
Sep 12 10:52:56 <b1tninja>	smbios id is pretty reliable, but some manufacturers just leave it 000000
Sep 12 10:53:02 <MrElendig>	mac address are generally the least reliable of those
Sep 12 10:53:08 <b1tninja>	and if they have multiple cpus
Sep 12 10:53:14 <eraserpencil>	i might just try binding to ssd serial
Sep 12 10:53:23 <MrElendig>	machine-id is generally the thing you should use
Sep 12 10:53:33 <b1tninja>	some people also use things like the creation time of the volume  / disk
Sep 12 10:53:41 <b1tninja>	really nothing is great
Sep 12 10:54:09 <b1tninja>	why are you trying to lock it to a specific machine, it just complicates your order/sales
Sep 12 10:54:41 <MrElendig>	one advantage of machine-id is that it is not locked to the hardware, so you can track the system even if you swap out the board
Sep 12 10:54:56 <eraserpencil>	yea, i read somewhere that the first thing to know about copy-proofing is that it does not work.
Sep 12 10:55:07 <b1tninja>	especially on linux
Sep 12 10:55:08 <eraserpencil>	it's meant to run without internet access
Sep 12 10:55:13 <MrElendig>	also, pretty much all serious management systems uses machine-id alraedy so..
Sep 12 10:55:26 <eraserpencil>	what exactlyis machine-id?
Sep 12 10:55:32 <b1tninja>	systemd makes a guid
Sep 12 10:55:39 <MrElendig>	`man machine-id`
Sep 12 10:55:39 <b1tninja>	via systemd-firstboot --setup-machineid
Sep 12 10:55:43 <MrElendig>	not limited to systemd
Sep 12 10:55:54 <b1tninja>	i dont remember having one pre sd
Sep 12 10:56:11 <MrElendig>	commonly used in containers/vm's that doesn't have systemd running too
Sep 12 10:57:02 <b1tninja>	one thing though, its just a file
Sep 12 10:57:12 <b1tninja>	if you were trying to make it difficult for people to duplicate
Sep 12 10:57:24 <b1tninja>	it'd work without any effort if they cloned the system/copied the file
Sep 12 10:57:28 <eraserpencil>	yea, if someone dd copies the ssd, then it's not much protection
Sep 12 10:57:39 <MrElendig>	if you want something hard to duplicate: tpm
Sep 12 10:57:54 <eraserpencil>	is there tpm module on all motherboards?
Sep 12 10:57:55 <b1tninja>	with attestation
Sep 12 10:58:00 <b1tninja>	no
Sep 12 10:58:08 <b1tninja>	and my tpm wont turn on without secureboot
Sep 12 10:58:13 <MrElendig>	eraserpencil: most modern ones supports it, but very few have the module pre-installed
Sep 12 10:58:27 <MrElendig>	and sadly there is not a standard for tpm modules
Sep 12 10:58:41 <MrElendig>	lots of oem boxes do ship with tpm modules installed
Sep 12 10:58:50 <eraserpencil>	is binding to ssd serial a bad choice?
Sep 12 10:59:10 <MrElendig>	then your tracking breaks the second someone changes the drive
Sep 12 11:00:02 <b1tninja>	ultimately there is no good answer
Sep 12 11:00:20 <b1tninja>	i think its best to just spend time on making a product pepole want to pay for
Sep 12 11:00:20 <eraserpencil>	yup. it should break if someone changes the drive.
Sep 12 11:00:26 <MrElendig>	ultimately the actual hard part is to define what is considered to be the "same machine"
Sep 12 11:00:35 <MrElendig>	what is the *actual* use case here?
Sep 12 11:01:16 <MrElendig>	if you are trying to do this as some form of drm: forget about it
Sep 12 11:02:17 <eraserpencil>	robot software. they would hardly ever be connected to the internet.
Sep 12 11:02:18 <MrElendig>	if you really want to stop people misusing the software: make a web service instead
Sep 12 11:02:31 <MrElendig>	or use hardware tokens for offline use
Sep 12 11:02:46 <eraserpencil>	like those usb dongles?
Sep 12 11:02:49 <b1tninja>	just don't use HASP / products made by setinel
Sep 12 11:03:05 <MrElendig>	it is generally better to just not bother though
Sep 12 11:03:13 <b1tninja>	my god, they install a webservice that allows arbitrary writes and runs as SYSTEM
Sep 12 11:03:54 <MrElendig>	just calculate the "loss" from piracy into your budget
Sep 12 11:04:20 <MrElendig>	provide additional service to ensure revenue instead, like actual support
Sep 12 11:04:26 <b1tninja>	or make something stupid and low effort
Sep 12 11:04:30 <b1tninja>	like write a file on first run
Sep 12 11:04:39 <b1tninja>	as a "install id"
Sep 12 11:04:56 <MrElendig>	or make it free software and earn the money from support/commision/etc instead
Sep 12 11:05:03 <b1tninja>	yes that too
Sep 12 11:05:06 <b1tninja>	especially given linux
Sep 12 11:05:20 *	b1tninja is tempted to encourage modification of GPL code
Sep 12 11:08:35 <eraserpencil>	yea, it's mostly support based, but we wanna track how many units would actually be in use and would require support, so that's why we are trying to prevent copying.
Sep 12 11:08:45 <eraserpencil>	still improving on business model
Sep 12 11:09:13 <djph>	so pull a red hat and sell the *support* license.
Sep 12 11:10:40 <eraserpencil>	im not sure about what it's like, but i think its support per unit sold. Since it's never going to be connected to the internet, it's hard to know how many units are in use
Sep 12 11:11:46 <MrElendig>	you could sell black boxes too
Sep 12 11:12:04 <MrElendig>	optionally in addition to just the software
Sep 12 11:13:09 <b1tninja>	pull a smartnet thing too
Sep 12 11:13:22 <b1tninja>	where you have to like call someone, to schedule a meeting, to like get a license a few days later
Sep 12 11:13:31 <b1tninja>	so you can get a signed updated
Sep 12 11:13:35 <b1tninja>	for a specific device
Sep 12 11:15:59 <eraserpencil>	we are selling black boxes...from what i understand of your description.
Sep 12 11:16:28 <eraserpencil>	but nothing prevents a clone of the drive
Sep 12 11:26:15 <DuckyDev>	Hi everyone.
Sep 12 11:26:52 <DuckyDev>	Anyone else who is having screen tearing while using the optimus-manager?
Sep 12 11:29:27 <irgendwer4711>	hi, one question to ext4 encryption. Do I have to enable encryption on root partition, when I want to encrypt home partition only?
Sep 12 11:30:15 <b1tninja>	no
Sep 12 11:30:47 <b1tninja>	also ext4 encryption? is there such a thing? Or are you maybe wanting to use luks
Sep 12 11:31:36 <b1tninja>	you can move /home to a seperate partition and have that encrtypted, and mount the unlocked one to /home in your /etc/fstab
Sep 12 11:32:18 <irgendwer4711>	I used this howto: https://tlbdk.github.io/ubuntu/2018/10/22/fscrypt.html
Sep 12 11:32:43 <irgendwer4711>	I cant enable encryption for home, when / is not enabled for encryption.
Sep 12 11:33:05 <b1tninja>	is your /home a seperate mountpoint
Sep 12 11:33:15 <b1tninja>	that would maybe make it possible
Sep 12 11:33:25 <irgendwer4711>	its a 2nd partition
Sep 12 11:49:54 <learningc>	How can I clear the framebuffer?
Sep 12 11:51:54 <Milijus>	WHats a good GUI to analyses strace
Sep 12 11:54:04 <paddy>	hello, i am Lady Mirabella, can you help to to setup a secure web server?

Sep 12 12:00:31 <Guifle>	hello,
Sep 12 12:00:32 <no_gravity>	Is there something like an enhanced sed, which understands [^abc] as "not a b or c"?
Sep 12 12:00:43 <Guifle>	how can I decrypt an img file?
Sep 12 12:01:34 <Guifle>	the file is the image of a luks partition.
Sep 12 12:02:37 <chazapp>	Guifle: something like `cryptsetup luksOpen /path/to/img`  ?
Sep 12 12:03:28 <no_gravity>	Can I make sed match only the first line of a file?
Sep 12 12:03:52 <TJ->	no_gravity: [^abc] works fine, as in echo "0123456789abcdef" | sed 's/[^abc]/t/g'
Sep 12 12:03:58 <Guifle>	chazapp, device and mapped name are required in addition
Sep 12 12:04:06 <no_gravity>	TJ-: Yes! I was mistaken. Thanks!
Sep 12 12:04:34 <TJ->	no_gravity: use an address range
Sep 12 12:05:52 <TJ->	no_gravity: as in echo -e "first\nsecond\nthird\n" | sed '1 s/.*/changed/'
Sep 12 12:06:04 <no_gravity>	TJ-: Nice, thanks!
Sep 12 12:06:13 <TJ->	no_gravity: for a start,stop range do:  echo -e "first\nsecond\nthird\n" | sed '1,2 s/.*/changed/'
Sep 12 12:06:33 <TJ->	no_gravity: there's no better place to learn this stuff than "man sed" :)
Sep 12 12:06:40 <no_gravity>	Can sed do "replace a with b but not if a was followed by x"?
Sep 12 12:06:57 <TJ->	no_gravity: yes
Sep 12 12:07:30 <no_gravity>	How so? I read it has no lookaheads?
Sep 12 12:08:48 <Guifle>	I am trying to create a loop device but it says device or resource busy
Sep 12 12:10:28 <TJ->	no_gravity: echo "ax0123456789abcdef" | sed 's/a\([^x]\)/b\1/g'
Sep 12 12:10:45 <irgendwer4711>	b1tninja: that didnt work. setup asked for encrypted root
Sep 12 12:10:49 <no_gravity>	TJ-: Ok, let me try that ...
Sep 12 12:11:47 <irgendwer4711>	https://pastebin.com/VZa66L8a
Sep 12 12:12:21 <no_gravity>	TJ-: Hmm.. then git diff shows me that sed added ^M to the end of the line.
Sep 12 12:13:15 <redsh>	Is Windows involved in this...?
Sep 12 12:13:33 <redsh>	^M is \r, I think, and Windows/DOS newlines are \r\n
Sep 12 12:13:52 <redsh>	That sed shouldn't add a \r at least.
Sep 12 12:13:55 <no_gravity>	Not that I know of.
Sep 12 12:14:09 <redsh>	Does `file` say it has CRLF line endings?
Sep 12 12:14:09 <TJ->	no_gravity: that's a CRLF isn't it? got windows line endings enabled?
Sep 12 12:14:10 <no_gravity>	Maybe it removed it? git diff now shows a bunch of ^M signs.
Sep 12 12:14:33 <redsh>	Well, I don't think that sed should've touched any line endings.
Sep 12 12:15:09 <no_gravity>	redsh: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
Sep 12 12:15:24 <redsh>	Then it probably had those before.
Sep 12 12:15:45 <no_gravity>	But why does git diff show them only now?
Sep 12 12:15:50 <TJ->	no_gravity: is this git repo one you created yourself or cloned from somewhere?
Sep 12 12:15:53 <no_gravity>	When I reset --hard, they are gone again.
Sep 12 12:16:02 <TJ->	no_gravity: because git config can be set to use CRLFs
Sep 12 12:16:07 <no_gravity>	TJ-: Myself. But some of the code is very old.
Sep 12 12:17:51 <TJ->	without seeing the sed command result and git config/diff and original file(s) its hard to guess
Sep 12 12:18:04 <mase-tech>	how to run scripts on a remote machine
Sep 12 12:18:22 <mase-tech>	In my case I want to test servers
Sep 12 12:18:39 <mase-tech>	the servers a installed in VB
Sep 12 12:18:41 <no_gravity>	TJ-: I wonder if it *added* or *removed* the ^M.
Sep 12 12:18:51 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech:  ssh?
Sep 12 12:18:58 <TJ->	no_gravity: depends on where in the git diff it is shown :D
Sep 12 12:19:11 <mase-tech>	can you link to a example
Sep 12 12:19:24 <mase-tech>	the thing is
Sep 12 12:19:29 <no_gravity>	TJ-: Or maybe git diff just shows ^M in the + line and not in the -line?
Sep 12 12:19:33 <mase-tech>	I have the script on my host system
Sep 12 12:19:44 <no_gravity>	Because it shows me something like this:
Sep 12 12:19:49 <no_gravity>	-oldstring
Sep 12 12:19:51 <mase-tech>	and I want to execute the script on the vb machine
Sep 12 12:19:55 <no_gravity>	+newstring^M
Sep 12 12:20:01 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech:  then transfer the script and run it through ssh
Sep 12 12:21:26 <mase-tech>	how to transfer
Sep 12 12:22:03 <Blondie101010>	how did you write a script?
Sep 12 12:22:12 <mase-tech>	I opened a file
Sep 12 12:22:20 <Blondie101010>	you sound like it's the first time you use a computer
Sep 12 12:22:23 <mase-tech>	put code into it
Sep 12 12:22:43 <mase-tech>	I cannot cp into vb
Sep 12 12:22:46 <Blondie101010>	there are hundreds of ways to transfer files, but I'd consider scp in this case
Sep 12 12:22:59 <Blondie101010>	is it connected to the network?
Sep 12 12:23:20 <mase-tech>	yes
Sep 12 12:23:35 <Blondie101010>	ok so what is the problem?
Sep 12 12:23:37 <mase-tech>	hmm I could open a file in the vb
Sep 12 12:23:49 <Blondie101010>	not my point
Sep 12 12:23:54 <Blondie101010>	can't you ssh into it?
Sep 12 12:23:55 <mase-tech>	and copy the things into that file
Sep 12 12:23:59 <mase-tech>	hmm
Sep 12 12:24:05 <mase-tech>	kinda stupid by me
Sep 12 12:24:46 <mase-tech>	but I thought a other way
Sep 12 12:25:00 <AeroNotix>	mase-tech: have you ever been as far as decided go what do look like?
Sep 12 12:25:26 <mase-tech>	I do not understand
Sep 12 12:25:33 <Blondie101010>	me neither :)
Sep 12 12:25:42 <Kumool>	I think its a meme
Sep 12 12:25:51 <Kumool>	a kid rambling about stuff
Sep 12 12:25:57 <pingfloyd>	a not making sense meme?
Sep 12 12:27:12 <mase-tech>	Well I am honest tell you were my problem is and you are answering with a not understandable meme. that is evil
Sep 12 12:28:12 <pingfloyd>	mase-tech: what is your problem again?
Sep 12 12:28:21 <AeroNotix>	copying a file to a remote host
Sep 12 12:28:24 <AeroNotix>	mase-tech: just use scp
Sep 12 12:29:08 <AeroNotix>	I'm still confused what "installed in VB" even means though
Sep 12 12:29:19 <mase-tech>	and if rambling like a kid means that I am sticking to a problem till I solved it. I am doing so!!
Sep 12 12:29:54 <AeroNotix>	tough problem, copying files to remote machines. Think Dijkstra wrote a paper about it
Sep 12 12:29:58 <mase-tech>	Well we a legal option to solve my problem
Sep 12 12:30:09 <mase-tech>	lets call it like that
Sep 12 12:30:10 <AeroNotix>	> just use scp
Sep 12 12:30:10 <Blondie101010>	what?
Sep 12 12:30:47 <mase-tech>	I was indeed a bit stubborn with my thinking
Sep 12 12:31:02 <mase-tech>	because I looked for a tool
Sep 12 12:31:23 <mase-tech>	which is sending the script to the ssh
Sep 12 12:31:35 <Blondie101010>	that is scp
Sep 12 12:32:13 <Blondie101010>	you could always redirect it to a ssh connection but then you could have a mess of escaping to do
Sep 12 12:32:22 <mase-tech>	and Blondie101010 suggested to copy the file over ssh into that machine
Sep 12 12:33:07 <mase-tech>	so the proffesional way is to copy the text into a file of the virtual machine
Sep 12 12:33:09 <ananke>	copy over ssh == scp
Sep 12 12:33:33 <pantato>	is there anyway to adjust the transparency on xterm using transset-df?
Sep 12 12:34:51 <Blondie101010>	pantato:  who knows?  you could be the first with that strange idea...  did you try it?
Sep 12 12:35:09 <pingfloyd>	mase-tech: it's not very clear what exactly you're trying to do
Sep 12 12:35:56 <mase-tech>	I want to test servers and tools
Sep 12 12:36:07 <mase-tech>	lets say
Sep 12 12:36:09 <mase-tech>	nginx
Sep 12 12:36:13 <AeroNotix>	is there a proxy like stunnel that will apply gssapi authentication to the connection? (counting until someone links me _that_ github project)
Sep 12 12:36:22 <pantato>	Blondie101010: nvm, i missed the section on setting the opacity
Sep 12 12:36:37 <AeroNotix>	or any proxy that I can connect to in the clear that will apply gssapi authentication on the connection
Sep 12 12:36:54 <mase-tech>	since I want to test and try on multiple machines
Sep 12 12:36:59 <jim>	AeroNotix, counting... sheep?
Sep 12 12:37:16 <pingfloyd>	mase-tech: are you just trying to run commands on a remote machine?
Sep 12 12:37:17 <AeroNotix>	jim: I just know some tryhard will google it and link me the first result. Waiting until that happens
Sep 12 12:37:23 <mase-tech>	I want to write a script, because it is a repetive task
Sep 12 12:37:47 <dylanwtf>	AeroNotix: i just joined, can i get the question so i can do just that
Sep 12 12:38:01 <evilscrew>	jim - hey im back
Sep 12 12:38:01 <pingfloyd>	mase-tech: what's a repetitive task?
Sep 12 12:38:07 <AeroNotix>	dylanwtf: is there a proxy like stunnel that will apply gssapi authentication to the connection
Sep 12 12:38:12 <AeroNotix>	have fun
Sep 12 12:38:16 <dylanwtf>	lmao
Sep 12 12:38:34 <jim>	AeroNotix, I'm the only one I know that does that... usually to become more informed by something in order to help someone
Sep 12 12:38:38 <mase-tech>	things you do multiple times
Sep 12 12:38:44 <pingfloyd>	mase-tech: what things?
Sep 12 12:38:47 <AeroNotix>	jim: noted
Sep 12 12:38:49 <mase-tech>	install nginx
Sep 12 12:39:01 <jim>	evilscrew, oh, hi ;)
Sep 12 12:39:03 <AeroNotix>	mase-tech: terraform/ansible/fabric
Sep 12 12:39:21 <AeroNotix>	puppet
Sep 12 12:39:26 <AeroNotix>	there's hundreds of things like this
Sep 12 12:39:27 <pingfloyd>	so you're trying to install nginx on multiple machines?
Sep 12 12:39:31 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech: do you want to install nginx or you want to run it?
Sep 12 12:39:32 <AeroNotix>	to automate fleets of servers
Sep 12 12:40:09 <jim>	AeroNotix, your thing is a bit specific, I'm not sure I'd get results from just putting your entire question into google
Sep 12 12:40:35 <pulcherior>	test from erc
Sep 12 12:40:44 <AeroNotix>	jim: I've been at it for a day. I'm not just opening a ticket and inputting it into ##linux and asking people to do it for me
Sep 12 12:40:52 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, the aim after testing is to run it
Sep 12 12:40:54 <AeroNotix>	of course I've googled
Sep 12 12:41:17 <jim>	AeroNotix, I didn't think you were
Sep 12 12:41:55 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, thats why I am creating virtual machines to test the servers and tools I am using with
Sep 12 12:42:06 <jim>	AeroNotix, I'm just saying there seems to be a lot of moving parts
Sep 12 12:42:09 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech:  ok..  do you still have a problem with transferring and running the shell script?
Sep 12 12:42:14 <dylanwtf>	AeroNotix: have you stumbled on this project yet? https://github.com/simo5/gss-tunnel
Sep 12 12:42:19 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, and after testing I have the experience to make a real server
Sep 12 12:42:24 <dylanwtf>	abandoned for 5 years tho
Sep 12 12:42:26 <AeroNotix>	dylanwtf: hahaha, it didn't take long
Sep 12 12:42:37 <AeroNotix>	just look at the source code - it literally doesn't do what it says it does
Sep 12 12:42:42 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech:  not sure what the point is
Sep 12 12:42:45 <dylanwtf>	i'm not that invested lol
Sep 12 12:43:15 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, :D
Sep 12 12:43:21 <mase-tech>	Are you serious
Sep 12 12:43:24 <Blondie101010>	YES
Sep 12 12:43:38 <AeroNotix>	mase-tech: I already gave you the answer
Sep 12 12:43:43 <mase-tech>	this is hilarous
Sep 12 12:43:51 <Blondie101010>	you are saddening
Sep 12 12:43:54 <AeroNotix>	learn what fabric/ansible/terraform/puppet are- one of those will solve your problem
Sep 12 12:44:03 <Blondie101010>	not so sure
Sep 12 12:44:15 <Blondie101010>	maybe but I think clarifying their ideas is more important
Sep 12 12:44:28 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, good point
Sep 12 12:44:46 <mase-tech>	I try to clearfy myself
Sep 12 12:45:11 <Blondie101010>	so all the script does is install nginx?
Sep 12 12:45:36 <mase-tech>	yes, make a small step before the next
Sep 12 12:46:01 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech:  isn't that a single package manager command?
Sep 12 12:47:19 <BCMM>	it's not enterprisey enough until you've automated the thing that automates your automation
Sep 12 12:47:37 <AeroNotix>	have fun doing things like a plebian then
Sep 12 12:48:35 <pingfloyd>	AeroNotix: it's not even clear what he wants to do
Sep 12 12:48:59 <AeroNotix>	Their English is not great but clearly, clearly they want to run a bunch of commands on a bunch of machines in an automated way
Sep 12 12:49:13 <pingfloyd>	AeroNotix: it's not clear if that is the case
Sep 12 12:49:22 <pingfloyd>	AeroNotix: especially when there is no answer to that exact question
Sep 12 12:49:29 <AeroNotix>	seems clear to me
Sep 12 12:50:45 <pingfloyd>	seems like an XY problem
Sep 12 12:50:57 <ananke>	mase-tech: show us your sample script
Sep 12 12:51:01 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech:  what is your objective?  to install one server?  to install multiple similar servers?  to learn automation?  is it to learn some skills for your current job, get a new job, etc?
Sep 12 12:51:42 <pingfloyd>	or it is to run commands on a bunch of machine from your own machine?
Sep 12 12:52:22 <mase-tech>	HI
Sep 12 12:55:15 <rueedi>	hi
Sep 12 12:55:24 <rueedi>	can someone read this???
Sep 12 12:55:32 <BCMM_>	rueedi: yes
Sep 12 12:55:39 <absence>	for some commands (notably docker), when i run "command | less", everything seems broken, e.g. new lines don't start from the left of the screen, and i have to press arrow keys multiple times to scroll one line, etc. if i instead write "command > stuff" and "less stuff", everything works normal. how is "command" able to affect less when piping directly, and how can i prevent it?
Sep 12 12:56:31 <rueedi>	thanks BCMM_
Sep 12 12:56:35 <Blondie101010>	absence:  it might check if it's run in interactive mode
Sep 12 12:57:03 <mase-tech>	ananke, this script is to small to show (trivial)
Sep 12 12:57:19 <BCMM_>	absence: is the command writing to standard error as well as standard output?
Sep 12 12:57:25 <mase-tech>	it is just 2 lines of code
Sep 12 12:57:54 <BCMM_>	mase-tech: if you keep your questions vague, people will, by necessity, keep their answers vague
Sep 12 12:57:55 <Blondie101010>	mase-tech: we all assumed so, which is why so many people are curious on what you're trying to do
Sep 12 12:57:57 <absence>	Blondie101010: less or "command" checks for interactive mode?
Sep 12 12:58:00 <BCMM_>	probably to the point of not being applicable
Sep 12 12:58:07 <absence>	BCMM_: no
Sep 12 12:58:12 <Blondie101010>	absence:  command
Sep 12 12:58:43 <mase-tech>	I read my things that I wrote
Sep 12 12:58:50 <_boot>	docker often does with things like docker logs, at least I find that anyway
Sep 12 12:58:52 <mase-tech>	and I do not know how to explain it better
Sep 12 12:59:04 <absence>	Blondie101010: that sounds plausible. is there some way to pipe to less as if it's not interactive?
Sep 12 12:59:33 <mase-tech>	I want to have some servers at home
Sep 12 12:59:42 <mase-tech>	to work more efficient with my team
Sep 12 13:00:09 <evilscrew>	jim i think my sticks dead but just outta curiosity what was it you wanted me to try.
Sep 12 13:00:11 <mase-tech>	so I tought the first thing to do is to have a reverse proxy in my network
Sep 12 13:00:30 <mase-tech>	that is why I to begin with nginx
Sep 12 13:00:43 <mase-tech>	I have no experienxe with nginx
Sep 12 13:00:58 <Blondie101010>	and why do you need to use a shell script?
Sep 12 13:01:03 <Blondie101010>	just do it
Sep 12 13:01:06 <mase-tech>	so I want to test it first on a vm
Sep 12 13:01:11 <ananke>	mase-tech: two commands are easily done with copy & paste
Sep 12 13:01:13 <evilscrew>	heroes in a half shell
Sep 12 13:02:01 <mase-tech>	sudo apt-get update
Sep 12 13:02:08 <mase-tech>	sudo apt-get install nginx
Sep 12 13:02:11 <mase-tech>	to install
Sep 12 13:02:21 <mase-tech>	but that is not engough
Sep 12 13:02:28 <Blondie101010>	enough for what?
Sep 12 13:02:31 <mase-tech>	it has also to run
Sep 12 13:02:43 <Blondie101010>	service ngingx start
Sep 12 13:02:47 <Blondie101010>	*nginx
Sep 12 13:02:57 <rueedi>	mase-tech there is a really nice docker image for an nginx reverse proxy...
Sep 12 13:02:58 <rueedi>	https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy
Sep 12 13:03:01 <Blondie101010>	but that won't make a website appear either
Sep 12 13:03:02 <mase-tech>	so I have to add also a user
Sep 12 13:03:15 <Blondie101010>	what?
Sep 12 13:03:19 <mase-tech>	for security
Sep 12 13:03:27 <Blondie101010>	a user to do what?
Sep 12 13:03:39 <Blondie101010>	if it's needed for the package, the package manager will create it
Sep 12 13:04:07 <ananke>	I'm not sure this is getting anywhere fast
Sep 12 13:04:26 <Blondie101010>	I'm sure it's not
Sep 12 13:04:36 <Blondie101010>	it's going awfully slow
Sep 12 13:05:13 <rueedi>	hihi
Sep 12 13:05:19 <mase-tech>	hi
Sep 12 13:10:09 <veek>	does unbound have an interface python can use? https://github.com/cbuijs/unbound-dns-filter/blob/master/unbound-dns-filter.py
Sep 12 13:10:45 <ivali>	Hello. I'm trying to "lock" a folder to disallow creating/deleting files in it during a sync. flock(..) doesn't seem to work in directories. Is there any other way to achieve locking a folder?
Sep 12 13:10:56 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, to install gitea you need more line of code
Sep 12 13:11:02 <mase-tech>	https://gist.github.com/CharlesThierry/c7d416a8e842625b3359d08feb66c2ae
Sep 12 13:11:37 <mase-tech>	therefore I need the scripts to automate it
Sep 12 13:11:47 <mase-tech>	I do not want to write everything by hand
Sep 12 13:12:06 <ananke>	mase-tech: uhmm, use docker for services like that
Sep 12 13:12:17 <mase-tech>	what is docker
Sep 12 13:12:44 <absence>	can linux fake a tty device for a command that expects a real tty on stdin?
Sep 12 13:13:01 <ananke>	mase-tech: you can use google to find answers to that question
Sep 12 13:13:10 <mase-tech>	ok
Sep 12 13:19:42 <Trifecta>	can someone tell me why i get Valid metadata not found at specified URL when i do zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/42.3/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/ oss ?
Sep 12 13:20:08 <Trifecta>	I can add a third party repo (which has a .repo file) but the official one doesnt work at all
Sep 12 13:20:21 <Trifecta>	and it seems like no one through google has that kind of problem
Sep 12 13:24:02 <mase-tech>	Blondie101010, are u here
Sep 12 13:24:54 <jim>	Please spell out u as you... it would help folks who are here and are new english speakers, some don't hear u as a rhyme for you (similar for other forms of abbreviations: y for why, 4 for for, 2 for to, r for are, etc)
Sep 12 13:26:41 <mase-tech>	I give my best, for good english
Sep 12 13:27:20 <mase-tech>	And I give my best to be as precise as I can
Sep 12 13:28:01 <mase-tech>	So I want advice from all of you.
Sep 12 13:28:12 <jesse1010>	does the mainline kernel have grsecurity's features yet?
Sep 12 13:28:45 <AeroNotix>	anyone familiar with KCP? No real question just wondering if anyone has any opinions
Sep 12 13:29:09 <dylanwtf>	what's KCP?
Sep 12 13:29:15 <jim>	never heard of it myself... what is it/
Sep 12 13:29:16 <jim>	?
Sep 12 13:29:35 <AeroNotix>	https://github.com/xtaci/kcp
Sep 12 13:29:38 <AeroNotix>	ARQ protocol
Sep 12 13:29:41 <AeroNotix>	has bold claims
Sep 12 13:30:46 <jim>	said bold claims must be in japanese :) can't read that
Sep 12 13:31:00 <AeroNotix>	Chinese
Sep 12 13:31:18 <jim>	oh ok... I can't tell the difference
Sep 12 13:31:19 <Trifecta>	nevermind all, i managed to do it. thanks anyway
Sep 12 13:31:34 <AeroNotix>	https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun better to read the claims of this, then
Sep 12 13:31:36 <AeroNotix>	same applies
Sep 12 13:32:16 <jim>	mase-tech, advice on which?
Sep 12 13:35:40 <mase-tech>	Ok I found a good example for my case
Sep 12 13:36:25 <mase-tech>	there is a person using zsh, tmux and vim
Sep 12 13:36:53 <dfrantzen>	what is the easiest way to locate mysql DB password if i have root access to server?
Sep 12 13:37:12 <mase-tech>	also programs had been modifyied by him
Sep 12 13:37:20 <mase-tech>	and the configs
Sep 12 13:37:44 <mase-tech>	everything what he did he wrote down to a script
Sep 12 13:38:28 <DuckyDev>	So I just got a magic touckpad 2 and it is working pretty well, howver xev doesn't detect anything when I do 3-4 way sswipe on th touchpad? Do I need to manually enable that through libinput??
Sep 12 13:38:33 <mase-tech>	so whenever he is on a linux maschine he can instant clone the repo and get everything setup to a new machine
Sep 12 13:38:54 <mase-tech>	so he has not to type everything everytime again
Sep 12 13:39:34 <mase-tech>	I want to do that with other programs
Sep 12 13:39:56 <mase-tech>	like I mentioned
Sep 12 13:40:07 <mase-tech>	nginx, gita webserver and others
Sep 12 13:40:41 <AeroNotix>	mase-tech: seriously, jesus christ, I mentioned like four or five times. Go learn about Ansible/Terraform/Fabric and do it that way
Sep 12 13:40:56 <AeroNotix>	some schmuck using crappy shell scripts ssh'ing into boxes is a pleb
Sep 12 13:43:02 <mase-tech>	xD
Sep 12 13:43:40 <ananke>	dfrantzen: you don't 'locate' it. you can change it, but you certainly don't 'locate it'
Sep 12 13:47:36 <triceratux>	anyone able to get the Fedora 30 lxqt iso to boot into vesa mode with a proper bootloader commandline ?
Sep 12 13:49:20 <triceratux>	it reminds me of running solydx when i was a n00b. it had the loginmanager wheezy didnt so its iso would boot on my r128 when the debian iso couldnt
Sep 12 13:50:17 <triceratux>	when you have no control over the way xorg loads modules certain hardware literally cant boot without the favours done by modern displaymanagers
Sep 12 13:50:31 <aaii>	Hi guys,I want a good book for start pentesting?
Sep 12 13:50:41 <aaii>	or video course
Sep 12 13:51:13 <triceratux>	apparently they do all sorts of stupphs. probe hardware, tentatively load & unload drivers, try video modes, turn on various framebuffers
Sep 12 13:51:21 <triceratux>	*32 bit solydx
Sep 12 13:52:47 <jim>	aaii, isn't that a googly thing?
Sep 12 13:52:47 <triceratux>	but none of them do it the way sddm does rofl
Sep 12 13:53:13 <aaii>	jim, maybe
Sep 12 13:55:10 <jim>	aaii, see what you can find out
Sep 12 13:55:32 <aaii>	jim, :/
Sep 12 13:55:35 <jim>	maybe also search on amazon... and, consider taking a course at a uni
Sep 12 13:56:43 <jim>	aaii, when you're actually pentesting, do you expect to ask questions at each step? you're going to have to figure some things out on your own
Sep 12 13:56:46 <aaii>	i know,thanks
Sep 12 13:59:10 <mase-tech>	AeroNotix, seems to be right. bash users are schmuckplebs
Sep 12 13:59:40 <jim>	aaii, https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&sxsrf=ACYBGNRBm8yG1CMKY6K-DKhLJ5PGMbpBRw:1568289437974&q=pentesting+tutorials&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB0eu2ncvkAhUBnq0KHTR5BO0Q1QIoAHoECA8QAQ&biw=623&bih=404
Sep 12 14:00:24 <aaii>	jim, :DD I searched thanks anyway

Sep 12 14:01:42 <jim>	both pages has some fairly interesting links
Sep 12 14:03:35 <jim>	aaii, https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/category/certifications-training/pentesting-certifications/top-pentesting-books/
Sep 12 14:05:13 <aaii>	jim, nice
Sep 12 14:06:51 <triceratux>	in fact, last time i had issues like this i bought a half height vesa card that plugged into a pci slot. all better. its really incredible that to this day the linux graphics stack doesnt have a keyword that means "i said vesa & i mean vesa" & you get vesa
Sep 12 14:07:14 <TheWild>	hello
Sep 12 14:07:35 <triceratux>	& i really dislike looking into the lives of the developers but theres really only one question remaining: "what can they possibly be thinking" ?
Sep 12 14:08:26 <TheWild>	files-saved is a symlink
Sep 12 14:08:26 <TheWild>	thewild@latitude-e6540:/tmp/ramfs/mdl/files-saved$ l ../files.sha512sums
Sep 12 14:08:26 <TheWild>	ls: cannot access '../files.sha512sums': No such file or directory
Sep 12 14:08:26 <TheWild>	but /tmp/ramfs/mdl/files.sha512sums exists! Is this an intended behavior?
Sep 12 14:09:55 <TheWild>	(hmmm... considering '..' points to inode and isn't simply an 'one directory level back'...)
Sep 12 14:11:00 <jim>	these were very simple searches, one or two words... I'm thinking you'd also need to have your linux skills up to the task of assisting you in your pentesting... in particular, you might need to automate arbitrary things that just come up... you might look into perl, python, lua for those, I don't know how the libs/modules of lua are, but perl and python both have extensive libs and modules that add functionality
Sep 12 14:11:12 <rascul>	triceratux a "vesa card" in my mind is one that used the vesa local bus, and those cards haven't been a thing for many years
Sep 12 14:12:08 <rascul>	i did have a 486 with a vesa card though ;)
Sep 12 14:12:21 <jim>	TheWild, ls -l /tmp/ramfs/mdl/files.sha512sums
Sep 12 14:12:30 <TheWild>	yup, I just did this
Sep 12 14:12:45 <jim>	did you get more than one or two lines?
Sep 12 14:13:14 <rascul>	triceratux the usage of vesa confuses me because it's never clear what exactly is being referred to... the company, or something the company created, or something that uses something the company created?
Sep 12 14:13:23 <triceratux>	rascul: ah yes. it is still in my memory banks. vesa is also a bus so you know you can rely on it if the software is engineered in such a way you can select it
Sep 12 14:14:32 <rascul>	it's not a bus in use for decades, though
Sep 12 14:15:32 <triceratux>	rascul: me too. but my confusion ended when i became an X11 partisan /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   31784 Mar  8  2019 vesa_drv.so
Sep 12 14:15:51 <rascul>	what is that driver for, though?
Sep 12 14:16:04 <triceratux>	im really not running gnu or linux. im running the x11 vesa driver & a bootloader
Sep 12 14:16:24 <rascul>	is the vesa driver for displayport? it's very unclear
Sep 12 14:16:49 <rascul>	(vesa helped to standardize displayport)
Sep 12 14:17:23 <triceratux>	its the driver that isnt a driver. its finally been superceded by xorg modesetting tho
Sep 12 14:17:34 <rascul>	vesa is associated with many things https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Electronics_Standards_Association
Sep 12 14:17:46 *	triceratux always gets this to work but each time looks into it more deeply
Sep 12 14:18:23 <triceratux>	so a sane driver, whether generic, free, or proprietary, generally makes use of modesetting & yer done. nomodeset is a whole nother universe
Sep 12 14:18:51 <triceratux>	& nvidia drivers are nomodeset ? is that right ?
Sep 12 14:19:04 <rascul>	they're trash, dunno about the rest
Sep 12 14:19:52 <triceratux>	in fact kms may have been added to the kernel so sane vendors could write sane drivers for the linux video stack ? is that what happened ?
Sep 12 14:20:10 <triceratux>	& then nvidia refused to play along
Sep 12 14:20:20 *	triceratux thinks hes starting to get this
Sep 12 14:20:42 <aaii>	jim, thanks for your answering :)
Sep 12 14:22:42 <BluesKaj>	Howdy all
Sep 12 14:23:05 <rueedi>	hey
Sep 12 14:23:52 <triceratux>	nope thats still not it. everybody uses modesetting https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_mode_setting
Sep 12 14:25:16 <triceratux>	its not modesetting btw. modesetting is an x11 module. its kms
Sep 12 14:32:01 <mase-tech>	Thanks for help people
Sep 12 14:32:26 <praxis>	hey is SFTP just ftp used in conjunction with ssh? or is it a whole separate service
Sep 12 14:32:29 <mase-tech>	AeroNotix, Blondie101010 jim
Sep 12 14:32:36 <ayecee>	whole separate service
Sep 12 14:32:54 <mase-tech>	I forgot ayecee
Sep 12 14:45:06 <triceratux>	but yeah, the more i learn about Plasma 5.16 & Xfce 4.14 the more i am compelled to get the LXQt sessions optimised. they all run fine with x11 modesetting. then some of them can drop right into vesa & the rest cant :)
Sep 12 14:46:20 <bullgard4>	dist-upgrade hat mir das Paket python-talloc installiert. https://packages.debian.org/en/sid/python-talloc What does the letter »t« stand for in "talloc"?
Sep 12 14:53:20 <bullgard4>	[Debian unstable] dist-upgrade installed with me the package python-talloc. https://packages.debian.org/en/sid/python-talloc What does the letter »t« stand for in "talloc"?
Sep 12 14:53:59 <ayecee>	i'm going to guess that the t is for Tridgell, the author. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tridgell
Sep 12 14:54:15 <bullgard4>	hm
Sep 12 15:42:12 <Merc>	well well well
Sep 12 15:43:51 <Thuryn>	so it seems!
Sep 12 15:44:23 <hodapp>	quite.
Sep 12 15:57:32 <triceratux>	indeed
Sep 12 15:59:09 <rueedi>	absolutely
Sep 12 16:09:40 <Henry151>	ok folks, i have a real tough one. Like, probably impossible.
Sep 12 16:10:23 <Henry151>	Soooo... I've got this home server running, itsa Dell Poweredge 2900. It's got 8 2TB drives
Sep 12 16:11:07 <ananke>	ouch, talk about a door stop
Sep 12 16:11:25 <ayecee>	that's easy to fix. put it on the curb.
Sep 12 16:11:48 <Henry151>	I set it up with RAID 6, so it's only like 6TB in the "storage" volume. Separate volumes for /var /home and /etc
Sep 12 16:11:55 <Henry151>	lmao, i love the thing actually
Sep 12 16:11:59 <Henry151>	it's made me very very happy
Sep 12 16:12:12 <Henry151>	so  i've got a bunch of crap running on it
Sep 12 16:12:17 <swarfega>	image
Sep 12 16:12:50 <ayecee>	so hey if you could get to the problem and save the background for after that would be _great_
Sep 12 16:12:53 <Henry151>	it's serving ampache, jellyfin, plex, airsonic, all through apache , and running a bitcoin node, a monero node, and an icecast server
Sep 12 16:12:57 <Henry151>	lmao ok
Sep 12 16:13:10 <Henry151>	i want to go from raid 6 to no raid
Sep 12 16:13:26 <Henry151>	or from "what i have now" to "having 16TB like I should have to begin with"
Sep 12 16:13:30 <ananke>	and you want our blessing?
Sep 12 16:13:50 <BluesKaj>	hehe
Sep 12 16:13:51 <Henry151>	no i want to not have to buy anymore hard-drives because i already have thrown way too much money at this stupid home fun project
Sep 12 16:14:05 <ayecee>	ok so what is the problem with that
Sep 12 16:14:23 <Henry151>	i don't have any volumes large enough to make an image of what i have now, put it on some other drive, and then change my raid stuff
Sep 12 16:14:28 <Henry151>	it's hardware raid
Sep 12 16:14:30 <ayecee>	if you're asking, can i do this without reformating, the answer is no
Sep 12 16:14:50 <Henry151>	ok so it's impossible
Sep 12 16:14:59 <ananke>	Henry151: that's not a linux issue. and no, you can't change from raid6 to <anything else> on those PERCs
Sep 12 16:15:17 <ananke>	i mean, you can, but it will involve data destruction
Sep 12 16:15:23 <Henry151>	dammit
Sep 12 16:15:32 <Henry151>	that was my question, you have confirmed what i figured already.
Sep 12 16:15:36 <binarym>	Henry151: open an account on AWS, push your data to the cloud, reformat, pull your data from the cloud, close the AWS account. That's it.
Sep 12 16:15:40 <ayecee>	that was easy
Sep 12 16:15:57 <Henry151>	binarym: hmm, that's a thought
Sep 12 16:16:01 <ananke>	pushing 6TB to AWS may cost him more than a new server & storage :)
Sep 12 16:16:21 <Henry151>	yeah well i have another *two* more poweredge 2900s
Sep 12 16:16:32 <binarym>	Henry151: protips to save money: do not run that kind of server at home: too powerfull, too much energy drained. The same server hosted on a datacenter would probably cost you less than your electricity bill ;-)
Sep 12 16:16:37 <Henry151>	so i could just buy 8 more 2TB drives and stick them into another one of those poweredges
Sep 12 16:16:46 <ananke>	that 2900 is an old clunker, nehelem era or earlier. heat generators
Sep 12 16:17:26 <Henry151>	yeah electricity isn't cheap around here either, $0.17 / kwh
Sep 12 16:17:46 *	Henry151 googles nehelem era
Sep 12 16:17:46 <binarym>	ananke: really ? Also if it's only for few days ?
Sep 12 16:17:53 <binarym>	i actually don't know well AWS prices.
Sep 12 16:18:08 <ananke>	binarym: you pay for traffic a pretty penny
Sep 12 16:18:20 <binarym>	ok
Sep 12 16:18:31 <G3nka1>	How can I keep track of size of folder? as it grows? while true; do ls -sh; sleep 5; done ?
Sep 12 16:18:34 <G3nka1>	Any better way?
Sep 12 16:18:48 <ananke>	Henry151: hah, those are actually most likely clovertown
Sep 12 16:19:02 <ananke>	G3nka1: what's the actual goal?
Sep 12 16:19:19 <Henry151>	well, i have been renting two Vultr VPS and one from Gandi.net and had hoped to migrate everything from those three servers onto these three servers just because i wanted them to be in my house and not far away and not rely on external service providers but instead do everything myself
Sep 12 16:19:20 <ananke>	and rather than ls -sh, use du -hs /dir
Sep 12 16:19:27 <binarym>	damn ... poweredge 2900 power supply can deliver up to 960W !
Sep 12 16:19:33 <cha18>	G3nka1: watch n -1 -t 'du -ch /dir'
Sep 12 16:19:41 *	Henry151 sets up a bicycle-powered generator
Sep 12 16:19:45 <binarym>	hahaha
Sep 12 16:19:57 <G3nka1>	ananke, I am running a benchmark and I want to see how much data the prgram generates during the benchmark
Sep 12 16:20:40 *	Henry151 writes his own kernel, and designs a new wheel, and forges his own cylinder blocks and pistons for his engine for his generator to provide electricity for his home servers
Sep 12 16:20:42 <ayecee>	oof, data transfer out from amazon is around $0.09/GB, so $90/terabyte
Sep 12 16:21:36 <ayecee>	free transfer in though.

Sep 12 16:22:42 <jkwki>	does anyone know why whatsapp web avatars arent shown allthough everything is set to green in umatrix?
Sep 12 16:23:00 <Henry151>	so, i have the trays like these: https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/400-aegg ... anybody help me find the cheapest source for 2TB drives that can slide into these trays?
Sep 12 16:23:13 <G3nka1>	cha18, sh: 1: n: not found
Sep 12 16:23:17 <Henry151>	or should i go bother ##hardware because this is not a linux problem
Sep 12 16:23:17 <jkwki>	when i disable umatrix completly for whatsapp web the avatars are shown again
Sep 12 16:23:23 <Henry151>	you people are just more fun to talk to.
Sep 12 16:23:41 <thevishy>	Does all XServer implementations have a compositor?
Sep 12 16:23:45 <cha18>	G3nka1: sorry, it needs a - prefixed to it. watch -n 1 ...
Sep 12 16:23:52 <ayecee>	Henry151: url doesn't work, redirects me to homepage.
Sep 12 16:23:59 <thevishy>	For example if I install plain XOrg, does it have a compositor too (inbuilt one)?
Sep 12 16:24:09 <G3nka1>	Ah right thanks cha18
Sep 12 16:24:57 <ayecee>	Henry151: oh, this just takes regular sata drives. you don't need anything special.
Sep 12 16:25:01 <thevishy>	I am trying to understand this sentence ... "As can be seen, the X Server doesn't have the info to decide which window should receive the event, nor can it transform the screen coordinates to window-local coordinates. And even though X has handed responsibility for the final painting of the screen to the compositing manager, X still controls the
Sep 12 16:25:02 <thevishy>	front buffer and modesetting. "
Sep 12 16:25:07 <thevishy>	From https://www.secjuice.com/wayland-vs-xorg/
Sep 12 16:25:09 <Henry151>	ayecee: oops... Dell part 400-AEGG
Sep 12 16:25:15 <binarym>	Henry151: you don't need try. Just pick External USB drive. It will be long to copy, but you have time, right ? ;-)
Sep 12 16:25:41 <Henry151>	well, i'd rather get a second space-heater running
Sep 12 16:25:48 <Henry151>	with 16TB
Sep 12 16:26:08 <ayecee>	i don't really understand where the 2TB limit comes from
Sep 12 16:26:16 <Henry151>	set everything up on that one, migrate it all over, minimal/near-zero downtime for my webservices
Sep 12 16:26:20 <binarym>	is it SATA drives ? or SAS ?
Sep 12 16:26:28 <thevishy>	Can XOrg work without a "compositor"
Sep 12 16:26:29 <binarym>	cause SAS are really expensive
Sep 12 16:26:29 <ayecee>	link says sata
Sep 12 16:26:33 <Henry151>	ayecee: i don't think there is a 2TB limit, is there? I thought i saw bigger ones on dell.com
Sep 12 16:26:48 <ayecee>	oh, it's just this 400-aegg part that's 2TB
Sep 12 16:27:54 <Henry151>	Dell part 400-AHID is 8TB
Sep 12 16:28:13 <ayecee>	you can put any sata drive you want that carrier, if you have spare carriers.
Sep 12 16:28:43 <Henry151>	i have 8 spare carriers, and two spare poweredges, and plenty of ram to set up one of them to be decent
Sep 12 16:29:03 <Tom^>	thevishy: yes, plenty of people. distros and WM that doesnt have or use a compositor
Sep 12 16:29:04 <Henry151>	but the 8 spare carriers each have like a 32GB drive in them rn
Sep 12 16:29:27 <ayecee>	well that's easy enough to fix
Sep 12 16:29:28 <thevishy>	Tom^, so if there is no compositor, who does the part of painting?
Sep 12 16:29:47 <Henry151>	yeah
Sep 12 16:29:54 <Tom^>	thevishy: uhm i guess it depends on what you mean by compositor
Sep 12 16:30:10 <Henry151>	but i got all of the above mentioned stuff for less than $300 total... so I don't want to go spend $300ea on 8 new drives
Sep 12 16:30:27 <thevishy>	Tom^, true, I was thinking about that too. Compositor seems to be used in different context at different places.
Sep 12 16:30:49 <Henry151>	I wish i could find like, an ebay listing for 8 2TB drives, used, for like $200 total
Sep 12 16:30:55 <thevishy>	My understand is that a compositor in the sense of a software that paints the windows, exists for an XOrg implementation.
Sep 12 16:31:20 <thevishy>	However a compositor that does fancy effects like window decoration etc is an optional attachment?
Sep 12 16:32:13 <thevishy>	window effects would be a better term
Sep 12 16:32:51 <G3nka1>	When I do tasksetp -cp 0-3 <PID> does that mean the process will be pinned to core 1,2,3,4 only?
Sep 12 16:33:58 <Tom^>	thevishy: well X has this "Composite" extension, and in Xorg world and what most people call compositor is something that uses that extension make X render the windows in a backbuffer, apply its various effects and then brings them back.
Sep 12 16:34:20 <G3nka1>	??
Sep 12 16:34:43 <ayecee>	G3nka1: probably?
Sep 12 16:34:51 <Tom^>	thevishy: so yeah, most compositors is pretty much a "window effects, with various degrees of opengl usage for shadowing, vsync and blur." :P
Sep 12 16:35:20 <thevishy>	Tom^, and Wayland says that "this piece of software" actually belongs to the display server itself.
Sep 12 16:35:42 <thevishy>	instead of it being an extension?
Sep 12 16:36:01 <Tom^>	not that well read into what wayland does or not, so no idea about that
Sep 12 16:36:02 <G3nka1>	why probably? ayecee I know taskset -cp 0 PID will make sure process will be pinned to proc 1, but will hyphen work as an argument for taskset is really the question
Sep 12 16:36:12 <thevishy>	okay Tom^
Sep 12 16:36:16 <Tom^>	and i dont see wayland replacing X anytime soon either for one very good reason.
Sep 12 16:36:17 <ayecee>	G3nka1: probably because i don't have the manpage open in front of me
Sep 12 16:36:18 <thevishy>	I was reading https://www.secjuice.com/wayland-vs-xorg/
Sep 12 16:36:25 <thevishy>	Network stuff?
Sep 12 16:36:43 <Tom^>	it doesnt solve anything the end user needs fixing. and at current state all it does is introduce more issues
Sep 12 16:37:23 <thevishy>	I wanted to write an wm for my own use ... I was thinking if I should learn the good old X programming.
Sep 12 16:37:51 <thevishy>	Some people say go for "Wayland" but I don't quite get what that means
Sep 12 16:37:53 <Tom^>	the idea or logic or implentation of it might be sound and sane, but it still wont fix anything besides create a new heap of issues for most, we dont interact with the display server much, we use the window managers, and the "desktop apps".
Sep 12 16:38:02 <EdwardIII>	hey, anyone know that tool foreman? i've been reading about procfiles, i don't get why foreman needs to use ports?
Sep 12 16:38:09 <thevishy>	right Tom^
Sep 12 16:38:41 <thevishy>	if I learn a wm written for X, I would still learn the fundamentals of writing something for Wayland too right? I mean the skills are portable?
Sep 12 16:38:43 <dminuoso>	EdwardIII: Presumably because it uses TCP?
Sep 12 16:38:47 <thevishy>	(Ofcourse API's might be different)
Sep 12 16:38:55 <dminuoso>	thevishy: Not quite.
Sep 12 16:38:59 <EdwardIII>	dminuoso: but why would it benefit from using TCP?
Sep 12 16:39:01 <dminuoso>	thevishy: X is vastly different.
Sep 12 16:39:02 <Tom^>	thevishy: that would require me knowing what wayland does or not, so no idea. :P
Sep 12 16:39:11 <dminuoso>	EdwardIII: What do you propose instead?
Sep 12 16:39:11 <G3nka1>	I tested it, it works ayecee
Sep 12 16:39:20 <thevishy>	ah okay ... dminuoso, but the fundamentals should still be same no :)
Sep 12 16:39:28 <dminuoso>	thevishy: Depends on what you mean by fundamentals, honestly.
Sep 12 16:39:32 <thevishy>	right Tom^
Sep 12 16:39:56 <thevishy>	ok by that I mean, an event loop that listens to various events and dispatches it to clients etc
Sep 12 16:40:03 <Tom^>	thevishy: i would still go with X anyhow, wayland isnt that much used besides the true neckbeards who practice in the GNU freedom RMS cult.
Sep 12 16:40:15 <thevishy>	Tom^ :-)
Sep 12 16:40:39 <BCMM_>	Tom^: uh, what?
Sep 12 16:40:59 <BCMM_>	are you suggesting that the problem people have with Xorg is the *licence*?
Sep 12 16:41:38 <EdwardIII>	dminuoso: well from bash when i manage processes i use ps, kill, etc and monitor the output on stdout and stderr and these tools aren't using tcp are they?
Sep 12 16:41:41 <Henry151>	so one more flailing desparate attempt at maybe solving my problems in an easier way..
Sep 12 16:41:44 <thevishy>	dminuoso, my goals are simple - write a simple wm that has a panel + title bars ... now the question is, if I do this ... would I learn enough to do something similar for Wayland too as long as I get the correct protocol
Sep 12 16:42:03 <Henry151>	with my current raid-6 setup, two of my 8 2TB drives are designated as "hot spares"
Sep 12 16:42:22 <thevishy>	or would I be wasting my time because wayland is totally different beast
Sep 12 16:42:28 <Henry151>	can I de-designate one of them without reformatting everything? and replace it with some huge 8TB drive or something, to expand my storage abilities?
Sep 12 16:43:12 <ayecee>	probably no
Sep 12 16:43:21 <ayecee>	i mean, you can definitely replace them
Sep 12 16:43:32 <ayecee>	but the extra storage wouldn't be used without reformatting
Sep 12 16:44:17 <thevishy>	wlroots does the part of writing to video memory in the wayland world?
Sep 12 16:44:19 <Henry151>	hm. i can't like change their designation in the raid array, to make them no longer hot-spares but instead whole separate volumes, without reformatting the other 6 drives, is what you're telling me, yeah?
Sep 12 16:44:43 <Tom^>	thevishy: well do X and if you get it really good, and people use it. make it run on wayland too. the multi display server WM perfected. :P
Sep 12 16:45:00 <ayecee>	i'm no PERC expert, but you probably can't change the raid geometry like that on the fly.
Sep 12 16:45:02 <thevishy>	right Tom^, I will take that approach :-)
Sep 12 16:45:56 <thevishy>	I will not worry about wayland vs x for now!
Sep 12 16:46:14 <ayecee>	even though i guess it's not the geometry that's changed there, just the number of spares
Sep 12 16:48:53 <Dagmar>	you can take the hot spares off the array
Sep 12 16:49:09 <ayecee>	ah
Sep 12 16:49:28 <Henry151>	this is a possible way to do what i wanna do isn't it?
Sep 12 16:49:34 *	Henry151 starts bubbling with excitement
Sep 12 16:49:43 <Dagmar>	....that is, you can do it if theyre reaaly spares
Sep 12 16:50:04 <thevishy>	Thanks Tom^ for your inputs!
Sep 12 16:50:07 <Henry151>	i have one "global hot spare" and one regular "hot spare" designated
Sep 12 16:50:13 <Tom^>	thevishy: sure
Sep 12 16:50:26 <Henry151>	if I can take them off the array, or even just *one* of them off the array, without damaging my data
Sep 12 16:50:31 <Henry151>	i would be so happy
Sep 12 16:50:58 <Henry151>	and then i could buy something like
Sep 12 16:50:58 <Henry151>	https://www.amazon.com/HP-Enterprise-Capacity-ST8000NM0055-Internal/dp/B07XFH2WCD/ref=sr_1_10_sspa?keywords=8TB+3.5%22+sata&qid=1568299386&sr=8-10-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyNjFXWkc1ODJOWFgwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjM2NDQzMTZWR1lRWUlCSE1YWCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDAzNjUyM1UxRFFNSEI3N1FJWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU= this 8TB drive and stick
Sep 12 16:51:04 <Henry151>	it in the freed-up slot
Sep 12 16:51:05 <ayecee>	urlgore
Sep 12 16:51:05 <Henry151>	oh god.
Sep 12 16:51:08 <Henry151>	i'm sorry.
Sep 12 16:51:10 <jim>	disks off a raid array you mean?
Sep 12 16:51:32 <Henry151>	jim: i have two disks designated as "hot spares"
Sep 12 16:51:32 <Dagmar>	if theyre really spares they donot contain.reqyured data,so removing them.does not affect the volume
Sep 12 16:51:33 <jan6>	cool thing about amazon and ebay urls, is that they can be shortened a TON ;P
Sep 12 16:51:41 <Henry151>	i am hoping i can take them off without messing with the volume
Sep 12 16:51:45 <jan6>	(without shortening services)
Sep 12 16:51:59 <Henry151>	i would need to also be able to tell the hardware raid controller to consider those slots as new volumes, or something
Sep 12 16:52:29 <Henry151>	or whatever would need to be done, to be able to stick an 8tb drive in one of those slots and have it as a whole new volume, separate from my raid array
Sep 12 16:52:47 <jim>	can you backup onto storage that's not in an array?
Sep 12 16:52:50 <Dagmar>	%hats something youd do through the management utility
Sep 12 16:53:04 <Henry151>	jim: i could, but, that's what i'm mostly looking to avoid having to do.
Sep 12 16:53:32 <Henry151>	i mean i would, back it up, but i would hope to not have to restore from that backup unless things went horribly wrong
Sep 12 16:54:01 <Henry151>	because it took me months of effort to get all these various services working correctly and i would never re-do it all if i destroy it
Sep 12 16:55:29 <Henry151>	so my roadmap right now is -- shut down the server, boot it up, open the raid controller bios-ish thing, and try to remove one or both of the "hot spares" from it there
Sep 12 16:55:57 <Henry151>	then actually remove one or both of the physical drives, and stick in the new 8TB drive in its place
Sep 12 16:56:13 <Henry151>	and hope that when i boot it up, everything still works just fine and dandy, and that I can see my new 8TB drive.
Sep 12 16:56:14 <Dagmar>	so long as you dont do anything that could be called "stupid" like ignoring warning messages from the management tool, youll be fine
Sep 12 16:56:45 <Dagmar>	like,if you drtry to drpp a volume from a striped array, itsgoing to yell at you
Sep 12 16:57:36 <jim>	what's 'drtry to drpp'?
Sep 12 16:57:43 <ayecee>	try to drop
Sep 12 16:58:03 <ayecee>	with a stroke
Sep 12 16:58:04 <Dagmar>	do you have stickynotes?  if you cant see the driver serial number without pulling it out, use stickynotes to fix that
Sep 12 16:58:34 <Dagmar>	im using connectbot right now
Sep 12 16:58:47 <ayecee>	challenging
Sep 12 17:00:06 *	Henry151 remembers typing "Yes, do as I say" at some prompt one time and then spending three days trying to fix his wrecked debian installation
Sep 12 17:00:18 <Henry151>	Dagmar: thanks for the warning :)
Sep 12 17:00:46 <makr8100>	Henry151: alias sudo 'b!tch i said'
Sep 12 17:00:52 <makr8100>	no need to thank me
Sep 12 17:01:02 <Henry151>	lmao
Sep 12 17:02:09 <Henry151>	i had some mess with being half-upgraded from 9 to 10 and trying to revert to 9, and then I tried to sudo apt install apt-transport-https , and it said "you're about to do something potentially horrible, type "Yes, do as i say"... and i didn't even hesitate
Sep 12 17:02:27 <Henry151>	and then my debian was broken and had no apt
Sep 12 17:02:39 <makr8100>	:/
Sep 12 17:02:45 <Dagmar>	once you understand RAID your biggest problem is going to be resolving what you see from the "inside" with thematchingphysical device.  hence,ensuring serial numbers are easily visible
Sep 12 17:03:05 <Henry151>	the folks in #debian really mobilized to help me fix that mess
Sep 12 17:03:18 <Henry151>	Dagmar: what do you mean?
Sep 12 17:03:59 <makr8100>	I don't wanna talk about raid right now lol
Sep 12 17:04:30 <makr8100>	I got a 2-drive raid1 replaced with 2 new drives, all was good except I forgot the bootloader
Sep 12 17:04:57 <makr8100>	no worries I'll just reinstall grub, except it's grub v0.97 and stage1 is corrupt so I can't actually get it to take
Sep 12 17:05:09 <Henry151>	stupid me was like "what will I ever need 16TB for! I can barely even fill up 1TB! I'll make it RAID6 and it'll be more than 6TB in the storage-volume alone! I'll never fill it up!"
Sep 12 17:05:10 <makr8100>	of course google isn't much help because it's all outdated crap
Sep 12 17:05:42 <Henry151>	then I decide to host a media server with 128,000 lossless songs and every movie and TV show I've ever wanted to watch...
Sep 12 17:05:53 <makr8100>	well there's your problem lol
Sep 12 17:05:59 <Dagmar>	i mean,lets sayyou have araid 5 array, and one of the disks is failing.
Sep 12 17:06:23 <Henry151>	three months later, my 6TB is almost full, and my friend says "hey, I've got about 200 movies in my collection already in .mkv format, let me add them to your server!"
Sep 12 17:06:24 <Dagmar>	raid5  providesfor one drives worth of redundancy.
Sep 12 17:06:54 <Dagmar>	so long as 4 of the 5 disks are fine, you are operating normally
Sep 12 17:07:03 <hodapp>	"I'm low on space, better buy more drives!" "I have all this free space, I better download more stuff!"
Sep 12 17:07:18 <kodah>	That's a lot of movies
Sep 12 17:07:38 <Henry151>	what I'm going to do for redundancy and to protect my collection, is I'm going to set up a second poweredge 2900, with equal or more space than this one... and I'm going to use something cool like Borg Backup or whatever, and make the second server be just a backup of the first server
Sep 12 17:07:42 <Dagmar>	you have to remove "LUN 2"
Sep 12 17:08:06 <kodah>	hmm
Sep 12 17:08:07 <Dagmar>	OH MY GOD WHICH DOSK IS THAT
Sep 12 17:08:08 <hodapp>	then next thing you know you are organizing Romanian fansubs of unremastered film scans of bootleg Simpson's prints
Sep 12 17:08:10 <Henry151>	kodah: it's pretty huge
Sep 12 17:08:14 <hodapp>	and they're 20 GB per episode
Sep 12 17:08:24 <kodah>	Are you wanting to play with a solution or are you wanting something battle tested Henry151?
Sep 12 17:08:34 <Henry151>	battle tested of course
Sep 12 17:08:36 <Dagmar>	If you remove the wrong one, you are f**ked
Sep 12 17:08:47 <kodah>	Gluster might be a nice option
Sep 12 17:08:56 <ananke>	Henry151: uhmm, if you had sufficient space to provide full backup, why all the fuss?
Sep 12 17:09:04 <Henry151>	you mean as an alternative to the "borg backup"
Sep 12 17:09:10 <Henry151>	ananke: well, i don't yet
Sep 12 17:09:12 <Henry151>	i'm going to someday
Sep 12 17:09:25 <Henry151>	i don't have the money to buy that much space yet :/ maybe a christmas gift to myself
Sep 12 17:09:34 <kodah>	ah
Sep 12 17:09:43 <kodah>	Gluster does have a big footprint
Sep 12 17:09:51 <Dagmar>	If, on the other hand you can look using the commandline tool to find out that "LUN 2" has serial numbert 987654, and you can see that on a sticker, you know which one to pull.
Sep 12 17:10:16 <Henry151>	i love tarsnap and use it as my backup for everything except my media, because, I don't want to pay that kind of money to back up a bunch of media
Sep 12 17:10:44 <Dagmar>	backups are probably more useful than.clustering at that level
Sep 12 17:10:54 <ananke>	I'm sure all said media was acquired legally...
Sep 12 17:11:00 <Henry151>	so i really wanted to basically make my second server a "tarsnap server" or similar or equivalent, and set up like an automatic nightly backup to the second server
Sep 12 17:11:13 <kodah>	ananke: of course ALL the proper channels were followed
Sep 12 17:11:16 <Dagmar>	If the filesystem iscorrupted, you can restorea backup
Sep 12 17:11:17 <Henry151>	ananke: of course!
Sep 12 17:11:19 <kodah>	Safe assumption
Sep 12 17:11:37 <Henry151>	at first, I was serving it all through ampache
Sep 12 17:11:43 <Dagmar>	if acluster is corrupted, you now have two machines worth of s**t
Sep 12 17:11:54 <Henry151>	ampache has this cool little feature, for arguing with people about copyright problems
Sep 12 17:12:06 <Henry151>	it has a setting you can flip on, where only one person can play any one file at a time
Sep 12 17:12:21 <Henry151>	that way, you can claim that it's like "having a stack of CD's and DVD's in the office, that everybody shares!"
Sep 12 17:12:44 <Henry151>	then, also, when you're listening to one of the CD's, you can broadcast it! and that's just like, putting it on the stereo in the office for everybody to listen to.
Sep 12 17:13:18 <Henry151>	I think it's a pretty bulletproof legal argument, as long as you leave that switch in the "on" position, and you don't pirate anything but actually buy CD's and DVD's
Sep 12 17:13:36 <kodah>	Probably not, but that's off-topic
Sep 12 17:13:40 <ananke>	hah. bulletproof. good luck with that
Sep 12 17:13:48 <diemos>	Henry151: You're still here! I expected you to be knee deep in LDAP by now
Sep 12 17:14:08 <Henry151>	diemos: i never even got started!
Sep 12 17:14:10 <kodah>	On second thought, Gluster is probably not the right solution especially if it's your first time touching gluster
Sep 12 17:14:35 <ananke>	with only two systems it's a bit pointless
Sep 12 17:14:53 <Merc>	i promised you guys i wouldnt poop again
Sep 12 17:14:59 <Henry151>	diemos: i got sidetracked and now have tabs open about FreeIPA and RADIUS
Sep 12 17:15:12 <Merc>	but ive let you down
Sep 12 17:15:15 <Henry151>	kodah: I'll probably just make a script in cron using rsync or something
Sep 12 17:15:23 <Merc>	ive let my family down
Sep 12 17:15:29 <Merc>	and most of all ive let myself down
Sep 12 17:15:37 <ananke>	Merc: take it elsewhere
Sep 12 17:16:25 <Henry151>	then i also got sidetracked trying to install nodejs, forever, statsd, and graphite, and hook them all up to my bitcoin node, to server something like this https://statoshi.info/ through my apache
Sep 12 17:16:58 <Henry151>	kodah: or borg, i really liked the look of borg
Sep 12 17:16:58 <ananke>	talk about a waste of electricity, running bitcoin miner on clovertown
Sep 12 17:17:06 <Henry151>	ananke: it's not a miner
Sep 12 17:17:08 <Henry151>	it's just a node.
Sep 12 17:17:18 <wozencroft>	A distro running gnome, how much RAM does it take after boot?
Sep 12 17:17:35 <diemos>	That's such an open question...
Sep 12 17:17:40 <Henry151>	https://www.borgbackup.org/ kodah
Sep 12 17:17:46 <wozencroft>	Approxymately
Sep 12 17:18:08 <Henry151>	that is the closest thing to an opensource version of tarsnap that i can run the server-half-of myself that i've found so far
Sep 12 17:19:36 <Henry151>	i really need to spend a few thousand on solar panels and put 'em on my roof so that i can justify having these servers in the home instead of renting a VPS
Sep 12 17:20:04 <ananke>	or you could replace said 'servers' with something from this century
Sep 12 17:20:19 <AlpacaFace>	Hello. If I wanted to customize a system chime for random notifications, where would I start?
Sep 12 17:20:33 <Henry151>	y'all keep telling me they're antiques, but man, they work great so far
Sep 12 17:21:15 <Henry151>	this thing has been able to serve crisp clear video, transcoding it to stream it, to as many as six different viewers watching different movies at once, with no hiccups
Sep 12 17:21:27 <Henry151>	using jellyfin
Sep 12 17:21:31 <ananke>	Henry151: while being reliable, they do not warrant the investment in expensive solar gear to offset the cost of electricity they consume
Sep 12 17:22:10 <ananke>	Henry151: they're ~13 years old
Sep 12 17:22:27 <Henry151>	meanwhile, it's also running a monero and bitcoin node, and serving ampache, airsonic, and plex, and icecast.. i mean, considering i have never had anything more than a bunch of crummy laptops, for me these things are friggin sweet
Sep 12 17:22:51 <Henry151>	i have never owned a high-end desktop of any sort
Sep 12 17:22:56 <Henry151>	or any server hardware before these
Sep 12 17:23:01 <ananke>	the intel processors of that era were huge energy trashcans
Sep 12 17:23:50 <ananke>	a semi-modern core i5 would run circles around them, and use 1/4th of the power
Sep 12 17:23:56 <Henry151>	i also was using a Panasonic Toughbook CF-30 as my "daily driver" main computer for like five years, until i got this lenovo p51 two years ago
Sep 12 17:24:14 <Henry151>	can you imagine, trying to run a bitcoin node on a panasonic toughbook cf-30
Sep 12 17:25:02 <Henry151>	core 2 Duo 1.6GHz
Sep 12 17:25:10 <Henry151>	ok? i'm in heaven now.
Sep 12 17:25:56 <Henry151>	i also was on a 6mbps dsl connection that cut in and out all the time and had deathly slow upload speeds for all my life, until the same time that i got these poweredges, i got near-gigabit-speed cable internet
Sep 12 17:26:01 <Henry151>	so i'm really happy.
Sep 12 17:26:48 <t4nk-freenode>	so will the electricity company be with you
Sep 12 17:27:26 <Henry151>	well at least i unplugged my 8-GPU monero mining rig, when I determined that it was losing about $0.26/day
Sep 12 17:27:37 <t4nk-freenode>	ghehehe
Sep 12 17:27:46 <Henry151>	i ran that at a loss for six months :/
Sep 12 17:28:00 <Henry151>	thankfully it was free, i would never have paid for all that hardware
Sep 12 17:28:04 <ananke>	we could have told you that 6 months ago...
Sep 12 17:28:24 <t4nk-freenode>	there's never anything the masses can do except fill up the pockets of the few, it's almost a law of nature
Sep 12 17:28:27 <Henry151>	but now I also wonder if I could stick one of those 8 GPUs into one of these poweredges ... XD
Sep 12 17:28:51 <ananke>	Henry151: no such luck, those 2900's are PCI-X era
Sep 12 17:28:56 <Henry151>	they're GTX1080i cards
Sep 12 17:29:08 <Henry151>	ananke: bummer.
Sep 12 17:29:22 <Henry151>	i could probably sell 'em, but they're not mine, so instead, they sit in my closet doing nothing
Sep 12 17:29:39 <Henry151>	i'm babysitting the mining rig, was told to keep any profits i could make and just keep it safe
Sep 12 17:29:46 <t4nk-freenode>	others could have bought them... for a reasonable price
Sep 12 17:30:00 <EdwardIII>	Henry151: which country are you in? USA?
Sep 12 17:30:04 <Henry151>	yea
Sep 12 17:30:12 <Henry151>	Vermont, the northeast kingdom
Sep 12 17:31:00 <EdwardIII>	i wonder if your electrity company assume you're growing the weed :D
Sep 12 17:31:13 <Henry151>	hah! maybe
Sep 12 17:31:22 <Henry151>	it has become slightly less illegal recently around here
Sep 12 17:31:32 <Henry151>	people are allowed to have up to six plants in their home
Sep 12 17:31:52 <t4nk-freenode>	last thing I heard was home growers lose $1.59 an hour on electricity
Sep 12 17:31:55 <EdwardIII>	crazy liberal
Sep 12 17:31:58 <Henry151>	my electric bill is about $200/month right now
Sep 12 17:32:20 <Henry151>	i know a grower who has like 10 plants? and they say it's about $800/month
Sep 12 17:32:41 <Henry151>	so even if they think i'm growing weed, it would look like i'm well within the legal limits in the state of VT
Sep 12 17:32:45 <t4nk-freenode>	6 plants in their home.. but not allowed to have grow lights, do they?
Sep 12 17:32:54 <Henry151>	oh yeah, you can have grow lights
Sep 12 17:32:55 <EdwardIII>	more expensive than an m5.medium instance then
Sep 12 17:33:00 <Henry151>	vermont is real liberal
Sep 12 17:33:01 <t4nk-freenode>	not in holland
Sep 12 17:33:14 <Henry151>	interesting.. and surprising
Sep 12 17:33:22 <t4nk-freenode>	yeh, for me too
Sep 12 17:33:25 <Henry151>	i would think holland would be totally relaxed and let you do whatever
Sep 12 17:33:30 <t4nk-freenode>	yeh
Sep 12 17:33:47 <t4nk-freenode>	I guess it only applies to mushrooms and heroin ;)
Sep 12 17:35:14 <Henry151>	here is my workstation for y'all to enjoy: https://imgur.com/IS2smP8
Sep 12 17:35:32 <Henry151>	that's the currently-running poweredge, you can see the 8 little green lights for the 8 2TB drives :)
Sep 12 17:35:58 <EdwardIII>	i keep getting these ads to go work for reaktor amsterdam
Sep 12 17:36:19 <EdwardIII>	nice workstation
Sep 12 17:36:52 <e^1>	is their any performance difference if i am using sway over i3wm ?
Sep 12 17:38:34 <BCMM_>	Henry151: the approach taken in the netherlands is "decriminalisation", not "legalisation"
Sep 12 17:44:47 <hodapp>	reaktor is a pretty cool synthesis engine
Sep 12 17:45:03 <hodapp>	someone who had actual music talent (i.e. not me) could probably use it to great effect
Sep 12 17:45:31 <hodapp>	also at this point even my freaking mom and her friends are like "LEGALIZE POT"
Sep 12 17:46:21 <hodapp>	it's basically Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham digging in and refusing regardless of support
Sep 12 17:47:58 <akik>	hodapp: native instruments reaktor?
Sep 12 17:48:22 <hodapp>	yes!
Sep 12 17:48:43 <akik>	is it for linux now?
Sep 12 17:49:09 *	hodapp shrugs
Sep 12 17:49:13 <hodapp>	I used it 10+ years ago
Sep 12 17:49:37 <akik>	i was happy to get synth1 working through airwave manager
Sep 12 17:51:04 <binarym>	17:31:58 < Henry151> my electric bill is about $200/month right now
Sep 12 17:51:04 <rueedi>	hodapp you think NI Machine will work as well?
Sep 12 17:51:22 <binarym>	Henry151: let's say that there's 100$ just for your server/heater
Sep 12 17:51:35 <binarym>	Henry151: https://www.online.net/fr/serveurs-dedies/store-2-m
Sep 12 17:51:42 <Dagmar>	now, now
Sep 12 17:52:02 <binarym>	79€ (i let  you convert), and you have an up-to-date Xeon with 3 * 6TiB storage
Sep 12 17:52:14 <Dagmar>	Server equipment is just as efficient as anichrome-driven space heater
Sep 12 17:52:30 <binarym>	with the 21€ left, you can buy some cool heater :)
Sep 12 17:53:01 <Dagmar>	"pop tart warmer"
Sep 12 17:56:17 <hodapp>	it's "toaster pastry". don't say "Pop Tart"(TM)(C)(R)(patent pending) without the proper qualifications
Sep 12 17:56:22 <TuxBlackEdo>	has anyone messed with a "PowerEdge C5220" server? I am trying to set up the BMC and I was wondering how one would go about setting up the main chassis bmc port?
Sep 12 17:59:02 <Dagmar>	TL;DR: On a dedicated VLAN "or else"
Sep 12 18:00:30 <Dagmar>	Youre basically talking aboit providing remote access to something that has a -lot- of stuff uding it that assumes privileged a(i.e. physical presence)  access
Sep 12 18:01:11 <TuxBlackEdo>	that's not what i am asking
Sep 12 18:01:23 <Dagmar>	Any access to that or iDRAC should involve very tight restrictions
Sep 12 18:01:42 <TuxBlackEdo>	I was wondering how i would go about setting up the chassis's BMC port... like how do I set up the IPs
Sep 12 18:01:57 <ananke>	the C series traditionally had some very crummy BMCs
Sep 12 18:02:43 <TuxBlackEdo>	"Each server can be configured to use the dedicated port. That port has a network-like switch in the
Sep 12 18:02:44 <TuxBlackEdo>	"
Sep 12 18:02:58 <TuxBlackEdo>	from dell's support manual
Sep 12 18:03:34 <TuxBlackEdo>	so that means I would need to go to each sled and set up the ip, and then i can use the main chassis port to connect to each of the servers to their corresponding ip that i set?
Sep 12 18:04:27 <ananke>	TuxBlackEdo: no. you manage each sled individually via its own dedicated/shared nic
Sep 12 18:04:40 <TuxBlackEdo>	then what is the main chassis bmc port for?
Sep 12 18:04:52 <ananke>	it's to manage the main chassis
Sep 12 18:05:42 <Henry151>	binarym: thanks for the links, i got a call (i do telephone support for a living) and i'm still on it now, that's why i went silent
Sep 12 18:06:06 <TuxBlackEdo>	ananke from the manual: "Dedicated BMC management is provided with the RJ45 port on the PowerEdge C5000 chassis.
Sep 12 18:06:36 <Dagmar>	"to let random teenagers power down your stuff"
Sep 12 18:06:54 <ananke>	TuxBlackEdo: yes, for said chassis
Sep 12 18:08:33 <TuxBlackEdo>	ananke basically my main goal is to be able to reboot these servers if they need to be rebooted, and so the question is, can I reboot each sled individually through the chassis BMC port, or do I need to use the BMC port on each servers to be able to do that
Sep 12 18:09:29 <Henry151>	the sunk cost fallacy prevents me from moving to a VPS or dedicated remote server
Sep 12 18:09:40 <illuminated>	what does the setuid bit on a directory mean?
Sep 12 18:09:47 <ananke>	TuxBlackEdo: you'd have to check the documentation and/or contact dell. like I said, C series uses fairly primitive BMCs, because it's meant to be an inexpensive platform
Sep 12 18:10:02 <Henry151>	i have already spent the $300 on these three servers, now I have to find some way to use them XD if I rented a server, I'd want to then *also* do something with these three
Sep 12 18:10:27 <Henry151>	then, even worse, I've already spent three months setting this one up, i want to keep it running until it shows 15 years of uptime
Sep 12 18:11:22 <ananke>	yeah, good luck with that on such antique gear
Sep 12 18:11:48 <TuxBlackEdo>	ananke how does one set up the main chassis's BMC port... if I take out all the sleds, the only connectors there are the two power connectors and the bmc port at the front
Sep 12 18:12:07 <TuxBlackEdo>	i am reading the manual and its not apparent to me
Sep 12 18:13:56 <ananke>	TuxBlackEdo: you may not have the full manual. it's typically done by having a pre-set IP, on dell systems it's often 192.168.1.120, root/calvin
Sep 12 18:17:15 *	Henry151 photoshops a screenshot to make it look like he's had 15 years of uptime
Sep 12 18:19:19 <Dagmar>	You dont ewant anything with 15 years of uptime on a network.
Sep 12 18:20:02 <kepler>	uptime most important thing on a box
Sep 12 18:20:43 <Dagmar>	At minimum it willbe unpatched,and possibly under the sway of some foreign actor who is faking reported data to evade closer scrutiny.
Sep 12 18:20:52 <kepler>	uptime > coffee > service > patching > children > *
Sep 12 18:21:08 <Dagmar>	No, keeping up to date is more importsnt
Sep 12 18:21:14 <kepler>	lies
Sep 12 18:21:51 <Dagmar>	 _Service availability_ is the most important thing on.anetwork.
Sep 12 18:21:55 <Henry151>	my uptime is 25 days, 15:53:35 so far
Sep 12 18:22:07 <Dagmar>	ifWorrying about uptime is bush league
Sep 12 18:22:29 <kepler>	idc if service is up. need that uptime brooooooooooooo
Sep 12 18:22:52 <Dagmar>	whether or mot the box was upand running100% of the time it was supposed to be up iswhat matters
Sep 12 18:23:24 <Henry151>	mine has been serving my services for those 25 days, I am very happy with myself
Sep 12 18:23:24 <kepler>	only thing you need is whatever allows you to see uptime
Sep 12 18:23:37 <Henry151>	i'm lookin at it in glances, personally
Sep 12 18:24:09 <Dagmar>	So set up Cacto & Nagios
Sep 12 18:24:23 <Dagmar>	er... Cacti
Sep 12 18:24:43 <Dagmar>	Theyreugly but involve the least amount of crap
Sep 12 18:25:06 <MrElendig>	or netdata
Sep 12 18:25:18 <Dagmar>	...although its possible yo make MRTG graphs not cause spontaneous ocular hemmorhaging
Sep 12 18:31:33 <cmj>	also munin

Sep 12 18:57:31 <veek>	is there a way to feed a dns mapping to unbound in real time?
Sep 12 18:57:39 <veek>	ad-filtering
Sep 12 19:02:07 <Aminder>	Im installing Gentoo atm and after I was done with the installation of the bootloader (grub2), it wont start. parted says that the partition has the boot and esp flags. What should I try to make it work?
Sep 12 19:04:19 <dgurney>	Aminder: are there any errors displayed when starting fails?
Sep 12 19:04:53 <Aminder>	it tries to boot on the hdd but then goes into pxe
Sep 12 19:05:40 <brownMessiah>	Hey guys, I want to increase the number of concurrent TCP connections I can have on a port in ubuntu 16.04
Sep 12 19:07:03 <dgurney>	Aminder: and you're on an UEFI system?
Sep 12 19:07:09 <Aminder>	yes sir
Sep 12 19:07:29 <dgurney>	good, just had to make sure, esp flag can be set on anything
Sep 12 19:08:09 <dgurney>	Aminder: do you see a gentoo entry on your computer's boot menu?
Sep 12 19:09:05 <Aminder>	It doesnt get to the boot menu
Sep 12 19:09:37 <dgurney>	Aminder: I mean the boot menu of the firmware
Sep 12 19:09:55 <dgurney>	if there isn't an entry there pointing to your installed grub, of course it cannot start
Sep 12 19:11:05 <Aminder>	I see SATA0 which has my hdd where all the partitions are, the other choice is SATA1 which is the dvd reader and the last option is network1 for pxe
Sep 12 19:12:41 <dgurney>	Aminder: try reinstalling grub using "grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=[efi directory] --removable"
Sep 12 19:13:11 <Aminder>	alright ill try this and let you know the result
Sep 12 19:18:30 <RoseBus>	hello, i'm on rhe7 and i'm doing "sudo su influxdb" but it's not switching me
Sep 12 19:18:37 <RoseBus>	and it's not giving error/anything
Sep 12 19:18:58 <RoseBus>	but if i do "sudo su dashboard" i can switch to dashboard no problem
Sep 12 19:19:36 <akik>	RoseBus: sudo su - influxdb ? or if the user's shell is false, sudo su -s /bin/bash - influxdb
Sep 12 19:21:43 <RoseBus>	akik, shell must be false
Sep 12 19:22:00 <RoseBus>	if i need to run a service with this user, i should probably set shell to true?
Sep 12 19:22:37 <RoseBus>	doing the sudo su -s /bin/bash - influxdb worked
Sep 12 19:22:54 <akik>	RoseBus: let it be the one the installation set it to
Sep 12 19:23:35 <Aminder>	dgurney: I reinstalled, it says "no error reported". should i reconfigure?
Sep 12 19:24:40 <RoseBus>	akik, well the "helpdesk" installed influxdb for me and if i try to run influxd i get permission errors for the data dir
Sep 12 19:25:04 <RoseBus>	but that's if i run the daemon with my account
Sep 12 19:25:23 <dgurney>	Aminder: that means the install succeeded. it should be able to pick up your previously-generated configuration, but you can re-run grub-mkconfig if you want to be extra sure
Sep 12 19:25:57 <akik>	RoseBus: they didn't set it to start automatically?
Sep 12 19:26:46 <RoseBus>	akik, nope
Sep 12 19:27:07 <RoseBus>	akik, they also said they installed a lot of other stuff for me like python3, django, psql etc
Sep 12 19:27:12 <RoseBus>	but none of that stuff was there
Sep 12 19:27:26 <RoseBus>	influxdb is here but it's not running as a service
Sep 12 19:27:35 <akik>	RoseBus: ok maybe you should follow the procedures your company has
Sep 12 19:28:06 <RoseBus>	ahah
Sep 12 19:28:20 <RoseBus>	he gave me sudo privelages so...
Sep 12 19:28:30 <RoseBus>	i dont have time to wait around for him to configure this i'll just go through the docs
Sep 12 19:29:00 <akik>	systemctl --now enable influxdb ?
Sep 12 19:29:38 <Aminder>	dgurney: I just reconfigured to be sure, just a reboot should work now?
Sep 12 19:30:07 <RoseBus>	oo akik i do see a influxdb.service file here
Sep 12 19:30:12 <RoseBus>	so maybe i just have to start it
Sep 12 19:30:36 <dgurney>	Aminder: it should
Sep 12 19:31:30 <RoseBus>	akik, yes i just had to systemctl start, enable
Sep 12 19:31:34 <RoseBus>	silly me
Sep 12 19:32:19 <akik>	9th wonder of the world
Sep 12 19:32:21 <dgurney>	RoseBus, protip: systemctl enable --now [unit name] enables AND starts it
Sep 12 19:32:32 <dgurney>	--now also works for --disable
Sep 12 19:32:41 <dgurney>	*disable
Sep 12 19:32:41 <RoseBus>	ahh okay thx
Sep 12 19:33:20 <Aminder>	dgurney: Alright, a new error appeared! We are making progress ahah. It says "Error 1962: No operating system found. Press anykey to repeat boot sequence"
Sep 12 19:33:49 <RoseBus>	Aminder, gotta catch 'em all
Sep 12 19:34:26 <Aminder>	RoseBus: Pokemon Gentoo Edition
Sep 12 19:34:36 <Thuryn>	i wonder why that's error 1962.
Sep 12 19:34:43 <Thuryn>	why isn't that, like, Error 1?
Sep 12 19:34:46 <dgurney>	Aminder: hmm, --removable should solve issues with many less-than-stellar UEFI implementations. what if you try to manually pick your hdd boot entry from the boot menu?
Sep 12 19:34:59 <dgurney>	I don't imagine it'd make a difference, but worth a try
Sep 12 19:36:40 <jim>	backj in a sec
Sep 12 19:40:09 <Dagmar>	what madness is this?  someone reading dics?!?!
Sep 12 19:40:39 <Aminder>	dgurney: Selecting the disk to boot doesnt solve it
Sep 12 19:40:44 <Dagmar>	RoseBus:  Seriously tho',mad props to you!
Sep 12 19:41:02 <RoseBus>	lol thx :D
Sep 12 19:41:51 <Dagmar>	Aminder: So youre *sure* that machine is booting.via UEFI?
Sep 12 19:42:35 <mossylane>	people are stupid... *sigh* i can't even
Sep 12 19:43:22 <prussian>	oh ok
Sep 12 19:43:25 <prussian>	then don't even
Sep 12 19:43:33 <rascul>	can't even what?
Sep 12 19:43:46 <Dagmar>	 that really looks more like a BIOS posting code. UEFI doesnt usually stuggle to find the ESP
Sep 12 19:44:02 <Aminder>	Dagmar: Yep, I can choose Auto, UEFI or LEGACY and UEFI is selecting
Sep 12 19:46:53 <dgurney>	Aminder: hm, might be worth jumping over to #gentoo and ask there then
Sep 12 19:48:10 <Aminder>	dgurney: alright, thanks for your time
Sep 12 19:49:24 <Dagmar>	Aminder: So then isthe "first" disk using GPT and does it have a dos-formatted partition flassed as EFI type?
Sep 12 19:50:50 <Dagmar>	Note that for most distros, you habe to boot the install media avia UEFI or it wont set up the UEFI boot environment properly
Sep 12 19:52:48 <Dagmar>	it seems liked based on.the error that the disk isnt partitioned right
Sep 12 20:02:08 <Sleaker>	anyone familiar with getting .desktop files to not pop the execute dialog with pcmanfm?
Sep 12 20:02:19 <Sleaker>	for some reason they're popping everytime.
Sep 12 20:02:42 <Sleaker>	I know you can set pcmanfm globally to just run executables without the warning, but I thought .desktop files were supposed to do that by default.
Sep 12 20:05:02 <OursBlanc>	Hi everyone :)
Sep 12 20:05:57 <chrisawi>	Sleaker: desktop files aren't used as launchers much anymore, and it's a security issue since a desktop file could masquerade as a document
Sep 12 20:06:08 <OursBlanc>	I'm the admin, how the user can hide somes file from me ?
Sep 12 20:06:20 <Sleaker>	chrisawi: uh ok, but the dialog doesn't happen when I do something like create a desktop file from a menu option
Sep 12 20:06:48 <Sleaker>	chrisawi: these are desktop files I'm installing into the system for all users so I need them to not pop security dialogs like they are normally installed apps.
Sep 12 20:10:08 <chrisawi>	Sleaker: is this the gtk or qt version?
Sep 12 20:14:27 <Henry151>	OursBlanc: in a pgp encrypted archive?
Sep 12 20:16:05 <Dagmar>	its amatter of the user could be clicking on.something that shpuld be afile that opens in gedit, but it could really be aself-extracting malware that invokes sudo
Sep 12 20:16:49 <Dagmar>	thisis bery much a possibilty if aomeone downloadsfiles straight ti their desktop
Sep 12 20:19:34 <ananke>	OursBlanc: we need more context
Sep 12 20:24:12 <C0nundrum>	Hello anyone know how to expand a relative path without readlink
Sep 12 20:24:37 <ayecee>	why not use readlink
Sep 12 20:24:59 <C0nundrum>	because i want it to work on linux and mac
Sep 12 20:25:06 <ayecee>	does mac not have readlink
Sep 12 20:25:11 <C0nundrum>	nope gnu
Sep 12 20:25:36 <ayecee>	how about realpath
Sep 12 20:26:04 <rcf>	It better have realpath.
Sep 12 20:26:43 <chrisawi>	Sleaker: in any case, the qt version has support for using gio metadata to trust desktop files: https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/issues/737
Sep 12 20:26:44 <C0nundrum>	also not there
Sep 12 20:26:48 <ayecee>	how about stat
Sep 12 20:27:00 <C0nundrum>	it does have stat
Sep 12 20:27:52 <ayecee>	eh, i guess that doesn't help so much
Sep 12 20:28:51 <C0nundrum>	i mean the path is the last column prob way to select the last column
Sep 12 20:28:56 <rcf>	realpath is in FreeBSD, readlink is in OpenBSD. A bit sad they're using what must be an absolutely ancient userland....
Sep 12 20:29:25 <ayecee>	this has a few different options. nothing trivial though. https://serverfault.com/questions/40144/how-can-i-retrieve-the-absolute-filename-in-a-shell-script-on-mac-os-x/40151
Sep 12 20:30:35 <ayecee>	a perl script, a shell script, and a bash function.
Sep 12 20:30:44 <ayecee>	also a suggestion to brew install coreutils
Sep 12 20:30:55 <C0nundrum>	it crazy that this is that hard.
Sep 12 20:31:01 <ayecee>	ikr
Sep 12 20:31:32 <rcf>	C0nundrum: you can always cheat and use a trivial C program to give you access to realpath(3) (which is POSIX)
Sep 12 20:32:09 <ayecee>	osx does seem to have readlink, from the sources i see - but it acts differently than the gnu one.
Sep 12 20:32:43 <Bey0ndB1nary>	hi
Sep 12 20:33:04 <Bey0ndB1nary>	I am not able to seed any torrent from qbittorrent
Sep 12 20:33:10 <Bey0ndB1nary>	Would anybody help me ?
Sep 12 20:33:19 <ayecee>	what happens when you try
Sep 12 20:34:15 <C0nundrum>	muwhaha
Sep 12 20:34:20 <C0nundrum>	p="~/.docker"; echo $(bash -c "echo got $1" $p)
Sep 12 20:34:34 <C0nundrum>	geeze that took an hour +
Sep 12 20:34:43 <MrElendig>	needs "" around $p
Sep 12 20:34:46 <Bey0ndB1nary>	@ayecee
Sep 12 20:34:48 <MrElendig>	always quite vars
Sep 12 20:34:53 <Bey0ndB1nary>	please check the below images ..

Sep 12 20:35:05 <Bey0ndB1nary>	https://ibb.co/fGKCZcH
Sep 12 20:35:12 <Bey0ndB1nary>	https://ibb.co/4tsb5PD
Sep 12 20:35:16 <MrElendig>	also printf is a thing
Sep 12 20:35:19 <Bey0ndB1nary>	https://ibb.co/4V0JKS2
Sep 12 20:35:30 <MrElendig>	use printf, not echo
Sep 12 20:36:03 <Bey0ndB1nary>	@ayecee, please check the images ....
Sep 12 20:36:10 <ayecee>	Bey0ndB1nary: what do these show?
Sep 12 20:36:40 <Bey0ndB1nary>	the status of the torrent i am trying to upload and it is not seeding.
Sep 12 20:36:47 <ayecee>	it says it's seeding
Sep 12 20:36:50 <Bey0ndB1nary>	i am not sure, why this is not happening.
Sep 12 20:36:54 <ayecee>	what shows that it's not seeding?
Sep 12 20:36:56 <msiism>	C0nundrum: Why do you do `echo $(bash -c "echo got $1" $p)'? I mean, why are you using a command substitution at all?
Sep 12 20:37:02 <MrElendig>	printf "got %s\n" "$p"
Sep 12 20:37:03 <akik>	what's the printf fanboi stuff coming from?
Sep 12 20:37:16 <Bey0ndB1nary>	But, if you see peers who are connected are not able to download it.
Sep 12 20:37:19 <rcf>	akik: echo is stupid, like much in the shell.
Sep 12 20:37:23 <MrElendig>	akik: printf avoids that subshell, and is portable, unlike echo
Sep 12 20:37:31 <ayecee>	Bey0ndB1nary: what shows that?
Sep 12 20:37:58 <akik>	echo is just fine. carry on
Sep 12 20:37:59 <Bey0ndB1nary>	this is the torrent i am trying to see, Could you try to download it and see ?
Sep 12 20:38:00 <Bey0ndB1nary>	https://www.dnoid.to/files/details/12794/041002295/
Sep 12 20:38:01 <msiism>	MrElendig: shouldn't it be printf '%s\n' "got $p" ?
Sep 12 20:38:04 <ayecee>	no
Sep 12 20:38:10 <Bey0ndB1nary>	OK
Sep 12 20:38:25 <Bey0ndB1nary>	my upload speed is ZERO.
Sep 12 20:38:43 <Bey0ndB1nary>	many people are trying to access the torrent and it is not uploading.
Sep 12 20:38:43 <ayecee>	so?
Sep 12 20:38:43 <MrElendig>	Bey0ndB1nary: have you forwarded and unfiltered the port(s)?
Sep 12 20:39:02 <Bey0ndB1nary>	i did
Sep 12 20:39:04 <rcf>	Bey0ndB1nary: this is not unusual, even if your ports are accessible. Your bandwidth might just not be enough to bother with.
Sep 12 20:39:07 <MrElendig>	msiism: no
Sep 12 20:39:23 <ayecee>	the clients may not be requesting data
Sep 12 20:39:42 <ayecee>	these may be bots monitoring the addresses participating in torrents.
Sep 12 20:39:55 <msiism>	MrElendig: oh, ok. why not?
Sep 12 20:39:57 <Bey0ndB1nary>	i have an legacy  router given by ISP which is  HUAWEI      HG630 V2 Home Gateway.
Sep 12 20:40:18 <Bey0ndB1nary>	i've 25 Mbps speed.
Sep 12 20:40:32 <ayecee>	Bey0ndB1nary: this doesn't appear to be a free download.
Sep 12 20:40:38 <Bey0ndB1nary>	when i download, i get the speeds of upto 3 Mbps p/s.
Sep 12 20:40:39 <ayecee>	Bey0ndB1nary: i don't think you're permitted to seed this.
Sep 12 20:40:52 <MrElendig>	msiism: whole point is to have all the fixed text in the format string and just pass in the rest
Sep 12 20:40:57 <Henry151>	I just made and ate this sandwich: https://i.imgur.com/cgvUGG5.png
Sep 12 20:41:09 <msiism>	MrElendig: ok, that makes sense, right.

Sep 13 07:52:38 <moaker>	okay I uninstalled my other distro it was giving me too much trouble
Sep 13 07:52:55 <moaker>	now im on ubuntu, touch screen works great out of the box, so does the stylus
Sep 13 07:53:27 <moaker>	so no point in "deepin" another debian derivitive boasting about "touch support"
Sep 13 07:53:47 <moaker>	so much bloatware on that OS
Sep 13 07:55:01 <moaker>	ubuntu is quite a bit faster
Sep 13 07:55:55 <_ev>	Could someone remind me of the gimp-plugin I am seeking. It's been years since I've used it. It was a Python-Fu or Script-Fu module which replicated a photoshop effect.   The module can delete fields and intuit what the background was, and replace it. So the background is saved and the foreground is removed, although they are on the same layer.
Sep 13 07:56:52 <Ruzzy>	_ev, I don't know it but I really want the answer too
Sep 13 07:57:07 <Mathisen>	_ev, search for content aware plugins
Sep 13 07:57:47 <_ev>	Thank you Mathisen - Just the breadcrumb I needed. Appreciate it!
Sep 13 07:58:09 <Mathisen>	moaker, any dist can be setup really to look 100% like any other dist it is just a mather of configuration. the idea of diffrent dist as diffrent DE is a joke. you can use all of them on any
Sep 13 07:58:25 <pantato>	anyone here use a tiling window manager and switched to a higher resolution display? like 1080p to 1440p or 2160p? I'm wondering if i'd find the tiling window experience a significantly better if i had more pixels
Sep 13 07:58:34 <Ruzzy>	_ev, are you seeing the gimp resynthesizer article I'm seeing?
Sep 13 07:58:39 <moaker>	Mathisen, yep, that is true,
Sep 13 07:58:53 <_ev>	Ruzzy:  http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/resynthesizer
Sep 13 07:58:56 <moaker>	the thing is, I was trying to install things, and had no idea why they wouldnt work,
Sep 13 07:59:15 <moaker>	then I found out that distro used their own WM which wasn't gnome, or kde
Sep 13 07:59:48 <_ev>	Scratch that Ruzzy: "The registry is dead". I'll find it.
Sep 13 07:59:48 <moaker>	im gonna try to attempt to launch compiz on ubuntu
Sep 13 08:00:00 <moaker>	because it sure messed things up on deepin
Sep 13 08:01:48 <moaker>	yeah doesnt work
Sep 13 08:02:20 <moaker>	it did get alot futher though than on deepin
Sep 13 08:02:37 <moaker>	also it auto-restored the old WM which deepin did not do,
Sep 13 08:02:50 <moaker>	and I hard to basically hard reboot, lol
Sep 13 08:03:46 <Mathisen>	does not ubuntu use wayland these days ? im not a ubuntu user myself but if that is the case you might want to look into Wayfire instead of compiz
Sep 13 08:04:15 <moaker>	also ubuntu recognized the error, compiled a report, and gives me a send option, thats rather nice of them, heh
Sep 13 08:04:27 <moaker>	i will try that, thank you
Sep 13 08:04:53 <Ruzzy>	_ev, this resynthesizer looks amazing
Sep 13 08:05:43 <_ev>	I used it years ago, it was perfect.
Sep 13 08:05:51 <_ev>	was/is*
Sep 13 08:08:01 <moaker>	ohhh hell yeah
Sep 13 08:09:09 <moaker>	auto rotate works with my tablet without the curser  being off or the pen stylus bugging out
Sep 13 08:09:33 <moaker>	deepin had a mode where you "rotate" it manually, and it never worked
Sep 13 08:11:06 <moaker>	noice... full touch operation and stylus support out of the box
Sep 13 08:11:58 <moaker>	the keyboard even pops up automaticaly heeh
Sep 13 08:14:06 <moaker>	power management is on point too
Sep 13 08:15:25 <moaker>	pretty sweet...mmission accomplished
Sep 13 08:15:48 <BCMM>	Mathisen: ubuntu uses Gnome, which is wayland by default, but falls back to x11 under certain circumstances (bad or missing graphics drivers)
Sep 13 08:19:42 <Mathisen>	ok
Sep 13 08:20:05 <pi0>	is it possible to use android phone as vr device in linux
Sep 13 08:24:23 <aGaTHoS>	why if im using a whole disk for a filesystem without partitions, it does not show on /dev/disks/by-uuid and i cannot mount by uuid in fstab even if tune2fs -l /dev/... gives me a uuid?
Sep 13 08:25:27 <pi0>	anyone here use vr on linux

Sep 15 22:46:32 <Gustavo6046>	Cinnamon is once again in software rendering mode...
Sep 15 22:49:42 <digital-_-mystik>	hello.. does anyone know the best way to execute a custom xrandr command at startup? I would like to enable dynamic resolution resizing in QEMU/KVM in a debian-based guest, and have spice drivers installed. The command in question is `xrandr --output Virtual-0 --auto` .. I have tried adding it to `crontab -e`, making an executable script with just the command and putting it in `~/.profile`, and also just using KDE's
Sep 15 22:49:43 <digital-_-mystik>	autostart with the script.. nothing has worked so far
Sep 15 22:49:47 <Gustavo6046>	For some reason my video card isn't being detected by lspci... :/
Sep 15 22:49:50 <Gustavo6046>	I'll restart.
Sep 15 22:50:49 <billings>	digital-_-mystik: crontab won't work because it doesn't have access to the display
Sep 15 22:50:57 <billings>	neither will .profile
Sep 15 22:51:16 <billings>	unless you set DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY but you probably don't want to do that
Sep 15 22:51:39 <digital-_-mystik>	billings: ahh for sure.. any suggestions?
Sep 15 22:51:52 <digital-_-mystik>	I haven't really been able to find anything
Sep 15 22:51:52 <billings>	kde's autostart has the best luck -- do you want it part of the the login session, or should it run in kde's login manager?
Sep 15 22:52:36 <digital-_-mystik>	login session is fine.. I created an `autostart.sh` file with just the command.. am I missing any parameters or can I just have the command in there?
Sep 15 22:52:41 <akik>	digital-_-mystik: i put those in xinitrc.d
Sep 15 22:53:14 <billings>	in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d?
Sep 15 22:53:54 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: normally xinitrc is where that kind of thing goes
Sep 15 22:54:01 <phogg>	or .xsessionrc if your X supports it
Sep 15 22:54:07 <digital-_-mystik>	sounds good.. I'll try it out
Sep 15 22:54:15 <phogg>	you need X to be up and the client to be authorized
Sep 15 22:54:31 <akik>	billings: yes
Sep 15 22:55:00 <billings>	yeah, I agree, if your distro has an /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ those shell scripts are evaluated with your X11 session starting
Sep 15 22:55:03 <Ckat>	why not ~/.xinitrc
Sep 15 22:55:20 <billings>	login managers like gdm or lightdm don't read ~/.xinitrc
Sep 15 22:55:30 <Ckat>	pft
Sep 15 22:55:56 <digital-_-mystik>	what about SDDM?
Sep 15 22:56:03 <billings>	probably not
Sep 15 22:56:06 <phogg>	billings: this is why on Debian there's an .xsessionrc
Sep 15 22:56:32 <billings>	would make sense to put in a global location, though
Sep 15 22:56:58 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: each *dm has its own startup script mechanism, which would also work for this. But, after login the resolution could be different.
Sep 15 22:57:58 <digital-_-mystik>	when adding it to xinitrc.d, am I just putting the command in there or a path to a script?
Sep 15 22:57:59 <phogg>	billings: /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ on Debian.
Sep 15 22:58:36 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: full path is safer as it does not depend on PATH being set as you expect
Sep 15 22:58:54 <Gustavo6046>	Bumblebee doesn't want to run glxgears, and Cinnamon is in software rendering mode. I've found three lines in journalctl which are of utmost interest.
Sep 15 22:58:56 <Gustavo6046>	https://termbin.com/8nfn
Sep 15 22:58:56 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: that said, xrandr is probably in PATH anyway
Sep 15 22:59:37 <digital-_-mystik>	does the executable script need to be in root or is home fine?
Sep 15 22:59:42 <Gustavo6046>	There are more interesting lines, actually
Sep 15 22:59:55 <Gustavo6046>	https://termbin.com/i00w
Sep 15 23:00:09 <digital-_-mystik>	I have an Xsession.d directory btw since it's a debian-based guest
Sep 15 23:00:13 <lostfile>	hello there
Sep 15 23:00:16 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: it doesn't matter where it is. Also, you don't need a script if you don't want one.
Sep 15 23:00:46 <billings>	yeah, my raspi has an /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ and they don't have to be executable, just bash shell scripts
Sep 15 23:01:09 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: then drop a file in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ with a prefix number less than 99.
Sep 15 23:01:40 <jim>	hi
Sep 15 23:02:17 <phogg>	billings: each file in the dir is sourced by /etc/X11/Xsession (which is a #!/bin/sh script), so they must be sh scripts.
Sep 15 23:02:24 <lostfile>	hows it going jim
Sep 15 23:02:41 <jim>	lostfile, good :) yourself?
Sep 15 23:03:10 <lostfile>	just installed ubuntu on my laptop after fighting with it for so long
Sep 15 23:04:17 <lostfile>	i downgraded the bios and enabled legacy boot and some how that made it work
Sep 15 23:04:48 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to eir
Sep 15 23:04:48 *	eir removes ban on $a:eightball
Sep 15 23:04:48 *	eir removes channel operator status from eir
Sep 15 23:05:29 <lostfile>	eh yeah im still iching my head on that one
Sep 15 23:06:12 <Gustavo6046>	So, what do I do to further troubleshoot the Nvidia support?
Sep 15 23:06:39 <Gustavo6046>	Oh, nevermind.
Sep 15 23:06:42 <Gustavo6046>	It's working again.
Sep 15 23:07:23 <Gustavo6046>	You have new mail.
Sep 15 23:07:58 <jim>	damn, I've been waiting for my mail armor!
Sep 15 23:08:08 <digital-_-mystik>	phogg: sorry for the noobishness.. does it matter what the prefix is for the startup script? I added startup.sh to Xsession.d and made it executable with chmod.. all that's in it is `xrandr --output Virtual-0 --auto` .. I'm guessing that I'd doing something wrong since the other files in there aren't .sh
Sep 15 23:09:58 <billings>	digital-_-mystik: they're evaluated in lexical order so naming it 99whatever will make it run last
Sep 15 23:10:59 <digital-_-mystik>	ok.. so if x11-common_start is already 99, should I make it a lower number like 98?
Sep 15 23:11:02 <billings>	and the .sh suffix isn't needed (or appropriate, since these aren't executables, just bash shell scripts that are sourced by another bash script)
Sep 15 23:11:44 <billings>	yeah, probably need to put it before that, it has an exec in it
Sep 15 23:11:58 <billings>	if it sorts after that one, it'll never run. :)
Sep 15 23:12:46 <digital-_-mystik>	ok.. so I can just make a txt file like `98-xrandr` in there and paste the command or a path to a .sh file?
Sep 15 23:14:31 <billings>	you can do either, but it'd be simpler if you just put the command in the file
Sep 15 23:14:42 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: it does not need to be +x, but it needs to be sh compatible. It will be sourced. The prefix on the name determines the order. Your WM starts in a file prefixed with 99, so you need to have your own file come before that
Sep 15 23:14:55 <phogg>	digital-_-mystik: since all letters come after all numbers that means a numeric prefix
Sep 15 23:15:32 <phogg>	billings: to be very clear: these are not bash scripts, these are sh scripts. #!/bin/sh will interpret them, which is dash (a POSIX sh).
Sep 15 23:18:14 <dognosewhiskers>	Seriously: Is there really no "dating API"? I want to be able to do requests like: GET https://api.datingdb.com/find.php?min_age=18&max_age=35&min_attractiveness_point=3&max_attractiveness_point=8&gender=female&include_trans=false&is_verified=true&has_face_photo=true&livs_within_meters=5000&GPS_long=12.34567&GPS_lat=12.34567&personality_type=bossy&has_ever_used_irc=false&sexuality=straight&interest_keywords=walks,nature,painting... and then get
Sep 15 23:18:14 <dognosewhiskers>	a JSON blob returned: { 'e-mail adress', 'name', 'photo URL', 'ICQ', 'Kik', etc... } But even if you pay money, it doesn't seem to exist? You are stuck with these horrible scam websites which only exist to extract as much money as possible from desperate loners such as myself who haven't been able to even find a female to talk to online in the last 20 years... At least, this way I could in some meaningful way automate this and not actively have
Sep 15 23:18:14 <dognosewhiskers>	to hunt down every new possible match. (Frankly, I have no way of doing that at all these days. Everything is behind some massive privacy-pay-wall.) And please don't tell me that I should make such a thing, because I'd love to, but I'd just be wasting my time and energy since nothing I create ever gets popular and it never does for 99.99% of us... This would definitely have to be done by some entity with real marketing muscles. Nothing worse
Sep 15 23:18:19 <dognosewhiskers>	than endless fake profiles.
Sep 15 23:18:30 <akik>	damn you're a fast writer
Sep 15 23:18:36 <dognosewhiskers>	akik: How so?
Sep 15 23:18:43 <dognosewhiskers>	I typed out a long message and pressed Enter.
Sep 15 23:18:51 <dognosewhiskers>	It was sent as several separate messages.
Sep 15 23:20:59 <Blondie101010>	this guy is driving me crazy
Sep 15 23:22:11 <digital-_-mystik>	lol
Sep 15 23:25:07 <jim>	dognosewhiskers, so you're getting free service, but it's not doing everything you want?
Sep 15 23:25:48 <Blondie101010>	that's not what he's complaining about :)
Sep 15 23:26:01 <Henry151>	hi folks
Sep 15 23:26:10 <jim>	hi
Sep 15 23:26:28 <Blondie101010>	he would like a service where he can pay the site to get a reliable list of available females fitting his criteria including their email address and other contact information
Sep 15 23:26:39 <Blondie101010>	rather creepy!!!
Sep 15 23:26:53 <digital-_-mystik>	yikes

Sep 15 23:31:24 <panosdev>	akk: stalker.io
Sep 15 23:49:11 <dognosewhiskers>	jim: Huh?
Sep 15 23:53:59 <Dagmar>	dognosewhiskers: Just use Tinder already
Sep 15 23:54:55 <Dagmar>	It only takes a few minutes to flip through the list and then you can say you at least tried for the day
Sep 15 23:55:11 <Dagmar>	If you get lucky, hey maybe you get lucky
Sep 15 23:55:39 <Dagmar>	If you don't, you're only out a minute or two of your time

Sep 16 00:37:39 <dognosewhiskers>	Dagmar: "Tinder" doesn't even have a website, so that was worthless "advice".
Sep 16 00:37:46 <dognosewhiskers>	"Tinder" is the *exact opposite* of what I asked for.
Sep 16 00:41:26 <dognosewhiskers>	IRC never exactly contained the most pleasant people in society, but in recent years, it's got so bad that the only reason I endure this crap day after day is that it's the only place left where I can ask a question or two. I really wish I could find some means of communicating with people in a manner similar to that of early Usenet, where I use some kind of local client to send out a message to a given "category", and then people are able to
Sep 16 00:41:26 <dognosewhiskers>	respond to it, and do it not to pick fights and waste your time, but to actually help and in return know that the others will reply helpfully to them the next time they wonder something. That whole mentality has long since disappeared.
Sep 16 00:42:32 <dognosewhiskers>	These decentralized P2P web projects seem to somewhat steer things in that direction, but they are already full of toxic people and on top of that never seem to go anywhere.
Sep 16 00:42:44 <tonyt>	dognosewhiskers there are plenty of forums you join and post on
Sep 16 00:42:53 <tonyt>	*you can
Sep 16 00:43:21 <jan6>	usenet is also *technically* still a thing, ho probably even worse than irc
Sep 16 00:43:22 <dognosewhiskers>	No, there aren't, and you missed the whole point.
Sep 16 00:43:30 <dognosewhiskers>	Usenet hasn't existed for decades...
Sep 16 00:44:04 <jan6>	have you seen it's corpse? ;P
Sep 16 00:44:34 <jan6>	people stil SOMEHOW make money off of it, https://www.usenet.com/
Sep 16 00:44:56 <dognosewhiskers>	There are endless fake websites full of fake bullshit.
Sep 16 00:45:04 <aruns>	I think Usenet is used with Kodi.
Sep 16 00:45:07 <dognosewhiskers>	Just because they claim to be big and make money doesn't mean they actually do.
Sep 16 00:45:15 <jan6>	https://lifehacker.com/how-to-get-started-with-usenet-in-three-simple-steps-5601586
Sep 16 00:45:21 <aruns>	But not sure what usage is like.
Sep 16 00:45:27 <aruns>	Anyway.
Sep 16 00:45:32 <dognosewhiskers>	jan6: Why post that? What do you mean by it?
Sep 16 00:45:46 <jan6>	that it's not dead, exactly
Sep 16 00:46:09 <aruns>	I am looking to list the locations in which each command displayed as part of the output of the history command was executed. Is there an auditing tool I can use to achieve this?
Sep 16 00:46:22 <dognosewhiskers>	jan6: Except it is?
Sep 16 00:46:25 <aruns>	Ubuntu 16.04 is what I tend to use.
Sep 16 00:46:37 <dognosewhiskers>	And that shitty retarded web "article" by some clueless moron doesn't change that fact.
Sep 16 00:46:37 <jan6>	in that case irc is also dead
Sep 16 00:46:51 <dognosewhiskers>	99.99% of all "articles" these days are paid for and completely fake/uninformed.
Sep 16 00:47:00 <dognosewhiskers>	IRC *is* dead, as was also part of the point.
Sep 16 00:47:09 <jan6>	it's 2010, before they were paid for ;P
Sep 16 00:47:12 <dognosewhiskers>	Besides, you clearly didn't even read that "article".
Sep 16 00:47:16 <dognosewhiskers>	It talks about warez and crap.
Sep 16 00:47:27 <jan6>	pff
Sep 16 00:47:49 <jan6>	first paragraph explains it a bit, it focuses on the binary groups
Sep 16 00:48:25 <turtlebasket>	hi
Sep 16 00:50:41 <dognosewhiskers>	...
Sep 16 00:50:46 <dognosewhiskers>	Like talking to robots...
Sep 16 00:51:07 <aruns>	Oh I see
Sep 16 00:51:09 <aruns>	So with Usenet
Sep 16 00:51:16 <TomTheDragon>	Anyone know what would cause issues like this? Video core, Mesa, X11, my desktop environment? https://imgur.com/a/2ePrSc0
Sep 16 00:51:20 <aruns>	You downloaded certain files from certain user groups
Sep 16 00:51:25 <aruns>	Depending on your interests.
Sep 16 00:51:51 <jan6>	and nowdays people use it almost exclusively for files, not bulletin boards, yes
Sep 16 00:52:06 <aruns>	Right.

Sep 16 09:06:18 <annadane>	burn the witch
Sep 16 09:06:20 <svendre>	I don't believe everyone is the same
Sep 16 09:06:27 <deniska>	I hear higher pitches than many people, hearing that my phone finished charging is the lamest super power ever :)
Sep 16 09:07:00 <akoana>	annadane: I'd really recommend using the repo, it should solve  setup + dependencies
Sep 16 09:07:05 <deniska>	also I can hear when excel with a particular zoom level is opened on that screen ._.
Sep 16 09:07:29 <inahd>	hey guys, anyone know an easy way to de/activate a second monitor?
Sep 16 09:07:41 <svendre>	pull the plug
Sep 16 09:07:54 <annadane>	hit it with a hammer
Sep 16 09:08:00 <akoana>	svendre: people older than 20 years tend to not be able to hear anything above 12 kHz
Sep 16 09:08:14 <inahd>	not decommision
Sep 16 09:08:19 <svendre>	uh seriously, if it's plasma just go to system settings displays or whatever and there's a disable toggle
Sep 16 09:08:33 <svendre>	if it's gnome.. well... i don't know, I can't remember what gnome is like anymore
Sep 16 09:08:43 <inahd>	im using kde...
Sep 16 09:09:01 <svendre>	system settings _> display and monitor
Sep 16 09:09:03 <akik>	inahd: it's in the systemsettings program
Sep 16 09:09:03 <inahd>	but i would like to assign some kind of hotkey or widget
Sep 16 09:09:10 <svendre>	click the monitor and then uncheck enabled
Sep 16 09:09:42 <svendre>	ehn I don't know about that, but I'm sure there's a way it could be scripted and bound to a hotkey
Sep 16 09:10:00 <inahd>	i would like to figure that out
Sep 16 09:10:44 <akoana>	inahd: try  arandr
Sep 16 09:11:07 <svendre>	yeah I use that for dimming from command line
Sep 16 09:11:33 <akoana>	xrandr is commandline / arandr a GUI interface for it
Sep 16 09:12:18 <svendre>	a simple search reveals a solution: https://store.kde.org/p/1081194/
Sep 16 09:12:40 <inahd>	why do i suck at searching for things
Sep 16 09:12:56 <svendre>	try looking that up
Sep 16 09:14:30 <akik>	svendre: can you help me find an app to change "safely remove" to "umount" ? :)
Sep 16 09:14:38 <akik>	plasma 5
Sep 16 09:15:09 <svendre>	akik: yeah I've got a nice on in lxqt but I'm not in that OS at the moment...
Sep 16 09:15:18 <svendre>	I think you could just use dolphin
Sep 16 09:15:28 <akik>	it has safely remove too
Sep 16 09:15:38 <inahd>	haha well that turns both monitors off
Sep 16 09:15:51 <unholycrab>	im using some minimalist distros within docker images for obvious reasons, and i like to be able to shell in and telnet to different hosts for debugging purposes. many of these distros don't have telnet. is there a more primitive way to test a TCP connection?
Sep 16 09:15:54 <svendre>	I think it's safe to remove once it's unmounted
Sep 16 09:16:04 <inahd>	says the command is "xset dpms force off"
Sep 16 09:16:07 <svendre>	PCManFM-Qt File Manager is also nice
Sep 16 09:16:26 <inahd>	wonder if that could be modified, to turn off only the secondary?
Sep 16 09:16:38 <svendre>	wait I got it, Kwikdisk
Sep 16 09:16:39 <akoana>	unholycrab: netcat (also known as mc)
Sep 16 09:16:44 <Foxboron>	unholycrab: bash or sh?
Sep 16 09:16:58 <unholycrab>	bash, but i haven't tried sh
Sep 16 09:16:59 <akoana>	unholycrab: errm nc
Sep 16 09:17:01 <annadane>	nc. :P
Sep 16 09:17:16 <Foxboron>	unholycrab: echo "hello" > /dev/tcp/<insert domain/ip here>
Sep 16 09:17:32 <unholycrab>	bash: nc: command not found
Sep 16 09:17:38 <unholycrab>	Foxboron: whoa. cool
Sep 16 09:17:51 <Foxboron>	I think it was
Sep 16 09:18:16 <svendre>	usage:  xset [-display host:dpy] option, looks like ye with -display switch
Sep 16 09:18:27 <akik>	svendre: i tried configuring it with udev so that it would set the variable UDISKS_CAN_POWER_OFF but i couldn't make it work
Sep 16 09:19:01 <akik>	maybe i had the wrong action in the rule
Sep 16 09:19:50 <svendre>	akik: you're talking about what like usb memory sticks?
Sep 16 09:19:56 <akik>	svendre: yes
Sep 16 09:20:14 <akik>	95% of the time, umount would be the better choice for me
Sep 16 09:21:56 <svendre>	they're different things actually
Sep 16 09:22:10 <svendre>	so from the command line you have umount but then there's also another command called eject
Sep 16 09:22:21 <svendre>	the difference has to do with the power-down
Sep 16 09:22:44 <akoana>	:
Sep 16 09:22:59 <svendre>	as for the GUI, I'd have to reboot to tell you the one I like, I'm not sure offhand if dolphin does that automatically when you click the icon next to it (eject as well as unmount),
Sep 16 09:23:01 <akik>	i'll try with the udev rule again when i'm home
Sep 16 09:23:12 <unholycrab>	Foxboron: i guess its a one way pipe, though. so it just hangs if it can't connect?
Sep 16 09:23:31 <unholycrab>	and returns immediately if the host was reached
Sep 16 09:23:32 <akik>	SUBSYSTEM=="block", ACTION=="remove", ENV{ID_TYPE}=="disk", ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", ENV{UDISKS_CAN_POWER_OFF}="0"
Sep 16 09:23:56 <akik>	svendre: you have umount in dolphin?
Sep 16 09:24:05 <Foxfir3>	whats the issus with GPL? Ada is GPL. so what are the limitations?
Sep 16 09:24:14 <Foxboron>	unholycrab: I'm a little bit unsure about the details. Important to remember that it's an compile-time option
Sep 16 09:24:24 <svendre>	akik: yes, there's a little icon you can click
Sep 16 09:24:47 <svendre>	akik: on the lower left area of the program, looks like an arrow kind of thing
Sep 16 09:24:53 <inahd>	xset  --output $HDMI-A-0 dpms force off aint working
Sep 16 09:24:56 <svendre>	right next to the name of the volume
Sep 16 09:25:08 <akoana>	unholycrab: try      exec 3<>/dev/tcp/host/port; cat >&3; cat <&3; exec 3<&-
Sep 16 09:25:45 <unholycrab>	ah you can look at the return code that you get. crazy
Sep 16 09:26:08 <unholycrab>	that's pretty cool too akoana
Sep 16 09:26:51 <akoana>	unholycrab: using it like    echo "some thing" |  exec 3<> ........
Sep 16 09:26:58 <svendre>	akik: actually maybe I take that back, that may just be a feature in PCManFM
Sep 16 09:27:41 <svendre>	akik: ahhh OK so in dolphin lower left, where you see "Removable Devices" right click on the USB device name, and choose safely remove
Sep 16 09:28:40 <akik>	svendre: i don't want safely remove :)
Sep 16 09:29:38 <akik>	if i use safely remove, it removes the device from the system
Sep 16 09:29:50 <svendre>	akik: just unmount? well get kwikdisk then
Sep 16 09:29:54 <inahd>	xrandr worked!
Sep 16 09:29:55 <akoana>	unholycrab: correction:     echo "some thing" | (exec 3<>/dev/tcp/host/port; cat >&3; cat <&3; exec 3<&-)
Sep 16 09:30:23 <inahd>	the main monitor blanks when the secondary switches off... but it works...
Sep 16 09:30:40 <unholycrab>	akoana: that works. my life is completely different now than you
Sep 16 09:30:42 <akoana>	unholycrab: it will also read and write  from/to  the port
Sep 16 09:30:47 <svendre>	inahd: congrats
Sep 16 09:30:52 <inahd>	oh, but this doesn't turn it back on :P
Sep 16 09:31:00 <ruben23>	hi guys i plan to resize my windows guest OS on a linux host virtualbox saw the command -VBoxManage modifyhd- but how do i execute exactly.? anyone have idea
Sep 16 09:32:26 <inahd>	need some kind of if/then script that can execute the correct command, depending on the state of the secondary moniter
Sep 16 09:33:02 <two_dogs>	ruben23: looks like something ran from terminal pointing at 'vdi' file maybe?
Sep 16 09:33:07 <inahd>	e and o are next to eachother, on a dvorak layout ok?
Sep 16 09:34:38 <akoana>	ruben23: it is explained in the help of vbox (search for resize)
Sep 16 09:38:17 <inahd>	anyone clever interested in crafting such a script that could function in this capacity?
Sep 16 09:38:39 <inahd>	maybe i could bug my older brother...
Sep 16 09:39:04 <ruben23>	akoana: most of the how to help are windows basing not linux :(
Sep 16 09:39:15 <svendre>	inahd a basic bash script should do it, you just need something like: if ! <condition> ; then do this exit1 fi
Sep 16 09:39:54 <inahd>	haha yup
Sep 16 09:40:15 <svendre>	inahd: I'd try it for you but I'm currently on a laptop with one monitor and so screwups might be annoying :)
Sep 16 09:40:47 <inahd>	well, even just framing the structure of such a thing would be immensely helpful
Sep 16 09:40:48 <akoana>	ruben23: there is also a Virtual Media Manage in the Global Tools Menu...
Sep 16 09:40:56 <svendre>	what's the command you've figured out so far?
Sep 16 09:40:57 <akoana>	Manager*
Sep 16 09:41:19 <inahd>	xrandr  --output HDMI-A-0 --off
Sep 16 09:41:45 <svendre>	ok so we need a command that queries the state of HDMI-A-0
Sep 16 09:41:53 <svendre>	that tells you if it's on or off
Sep 16 09:42:37 <inahd>	i'm looking...
Sep 16 09:45:03 <svendre>	xrandr --listactivemonitors | grep <BBB> >/dev/null && xrandr --output <BBB> --off || xrandr --output <BBB> --right-of <AAA> --mode 1920x1080
Sep 16 09:45:17 <inahd>	whoah
Sep 16 09:45:39 <svendre>	just looked at a reference, so --listactivemonitors shows them all so you have to narrow it down
Sep 16 09:46:49 <svendre>	try looking here, there's a script: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/315726/how-to-create-xrandr-output-toggle-script
Sep 16 09:48:02 <inahd>	hmm, so BBB and AAA are to be replaced, in this script?
Sep 16 09:48:35 <inahd>	with secondary, and primary monitor name i guess
Sep 16 09:49:26 <svendre>	yeah they're placeholders, check out the script in the link, it's got like "VGA-1" and "LVDS-1", you can adapt this script (or maybe it'll work as is) just replace the names with your display names
Sep 16 09:49:53 <inahd>	this shall be done. i guess i need to rotate it clockwise as well
Sep 16 09:51:05 <akoana>	inahd: be careful "One limitation of this answer is that both outputs need to be connected.", so read the 1st response to the second answer (additional check)
Sep 16 09:51:30 <ruben23>	akoana: thats in the commandline coz the host is linux server
Sep 16 09:52:40 <inahd>	seems like i have to add "xrandr -o left" or some such, somewhere in that command
Sep 16 09:53:56 <svendre>	inahd: at a glace, I much prefer the script farther down in that link, did you see that? that's what I think you should use as your frame to adapt
Sep 16 09:56:01 <akoana>	ruben23: the I fear you have to consult the documentation: something like   vboxmanage modifymedium file --resize 100GB  ...
Sep 16 09:56:16 <inahd>	well, the script looks classy, but i might have to study it a bit to figure it out
Sep 16 09:56:40 <akoana>	ruben23: vboxmanage --help
Sep 16 09:58:18 <inahd>	this is a desktop computer, so yeah things will be connected ;)
Sep 16 10:03:59 <PlasmaHH>	Hi, there are certain conditions (like interface restart) where linux loses the registered multicast groups for a socket. on the application level, is there an easy way to detect that this happened (in order to resubscribe)?
Sep 16 10:05:33 <inahd>	attempted to modify and run script. errors.
Sep 16 10:05:43 <svendre>	inahd: yes, but it's a good reference, just study the logic and you can do it.  Here's a reference on bash to draw ideas and syntax from: https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/Bash-Beginners-Guide.html
Sep 16 10:06:09 <inahd>	gotta start... somewhere O.o
Sep 16 10:06:14 <svendre>	yep
Sep 16 10:06:26 <svendre>	even linus had to start somewhere... Minix manuals I believe
Sep 16 10:06:34 <svendre>	*minix
Sep 16 10:08:21 <Tech_8>	hi
Sep 16 10:08:27 <svendre>	inahd: python is also a good language for basic tasks like this
Sep 16 10:09:43 <svendre>	Tech_8: hi
Sep 16 10:10:15 <justsomeguy>	Python has less pitfalls, and is more predictable.
Sep 16 10:10:19 <inahd>	as much as i would like to get a grasp of the technology at this level, it's quite a commitment.
Sep 16 10:11:00 <soxfoxrox>	Hello. I am trying to add a cron job but I get an error I simply can't grasp, because the line works fine in terminal. Any help would be much appreciated: https://paste.linux.community/view/32722793
Sep 16 10:11:57 <svendre>	inahd: it's not that bad, try writing some very simple scripts first then, just do something like a simple if then with echo <text>, copy from the tutorial and try running them yourself, once you get a very simple working script, slowly change it and test it with each change, that way it's not biting it all off at once
Sep 16 10:13:02 <soxfoxrox>	oh, maybe I found a solution on stackoverflow
Sep 16 10:14:55 <sauvin>	Save successive versions so when you make a change and it goes BOOM, you can ditch the latest version and go back to the last one that DID work and try something else.
Sep 16 10:17:06 <justsomeguy>	soxfoxrox: The '%' sign is translated into a newline symbol within crontab files. Try putting your command into a script file somewhere, chmod u+x it, and then add the path to that script where your command currently is in the crontab.
Sep 16 10:17:41 <akoana>	soxfoxrox: ^^   and set the PATH in your script explicitly
Sep 16 10:17:47 <soxfoxrox>	justsomeguy, thanks!
Sep 16 10:17:50 <soxfoxrox>	akoana, thanks!
Sep 16 10:20:08 <justsomeguy>	akoana, soxfoxrox: Right, also don't forget to put a "#!/usr/bin/env bash" or (whatever other shell) at the top of your script. :^)
Sep 16 10:21:12 <akoana>	inahd: could you put the xrandr outputs (for the two cases you want) to a pastebin, like    xrandr | nc termbin.com 9999    and  tell us the url you get back ?
Sep 16 10:24:55 <inahd>	akoana: https://termbin.com/u0md
Sep 16 10:25:02 <inahd>	so crafty
Sep 16 10:25:15 <akoana>	inahd: let me see...
Sep 16 10:26:59 <flughafen>	iks there no way to delete inodes on ext4?
Sep 16 10:27:09 <akoana>	inahd: so the names for <AAA> and <BBB> would be "DisplayPort-0" and "HDMI-A-0"
Sep 16 10:28:26 <svendre>	I'm off to go play around with lxc, good luck inahd, I'm sure you're in good hands
Sep 16 10:28:34 <inahd>	tanks :)
Sep 16 10:29:03 <soxfoxrox>	justsomeguy, akoana, got it working, thank you so much for your help
Sep 16 10:30:58 <inahd>	i'm sensing that this little applet can't run a multi-part command such as this
Sep 16 10:32:52 <akoana>	inahd: tip, use arandr, adjust and save each setting to a separate file , it will create little scripts with the correct xrandr syntax
Sep 16 10:33:14 <inahd>	hmm compelling
Sep 16 10:33:51 <akoana>	inahd: later you can combine these scripts into one toggle script
Sep 16 10:36:41 <inahd>	ok, well here is the error i get:
Sep 16 10:36:47 <inahd>	/bin/sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `>'
Sep 16 10:36:49 <inahd>	/bin/sh: -c: line 0: `xrandr --listactivemonitors | grep <HDMI-A-0> >/dev/null && xrandr --output <HDMI-A-0> --off || xrandr --output <HDMI-A-0> --right-of <DisplayPort-0-0> --mode 1920x1080 --rotate left '
Sep 16 10:37:05 <inahd>	i think i see it now
Sep 16 10:37:09 <akoana>	inahd: remove the <>
Sep 16 10:37:39 <akoana>	inahd: HDMI-A-0  instead of <HDMI-A-0>
Sep 16 10:38:13 <akoana>	inahd: same for DisplayPort-0-0
Sep 16 10:39:48 <akoana>	inahd: it should be   DisplayPort-0   right?
Sep 16 10:44:09 <inahd>	hehehehehe
Sep 16 10:44:26 <inahd>	it's upside down, but it works
Sep 16 10:45:57 <inahd>	hmm... seems cloned, not a new area
Sep 16 10:46:56 <inahd>	xrandr --listactivemonitors | grep HDMI-A-0 >/dev/null && xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --off || xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --right-of DVI-D-0 --mode 1680x1050 --rotate right
Sep 16 10:47:54 <akoana>	inahd:  really, use arandr   try out with apply and save it to files, except you're are a masochist :)
Sep 16 10:49:46 <inahd>	it's really that i am just barely making this work
Sep 16 10:50:26 <inahd>	that sounds like a level above what i'm doing with this
Sep 16 10:50:37 <TheWild>	hello
Sep 16 10:50:42 <inahd>	(and i'm so close)
Sep 16 10:51:05 <TheWild>	raw data. How to interpret is as a sound? It's easy, we have pacat and Audacity.
Sep 16 10:51:05 <TheWild>	But how to interpret it as image?
Sep 16 10:51:47 <djph>	TheWild: easy, we gave imagemagic ?
Sep 16 10:51:51 <djph>	*have
Sep 16 10:52:12 <TheWild>	can it interpret raw data. Hmm... I'm going to check.
Sep 16 10:52:21 <milivoj>	pretty sure it can
Sep 16 10:52:27 <milivoj>	it's magic
Sep 16 10:52:30 <TheWild>	from my experience ImageMagick (convert) isn't so easy to use.
Sep 16 10:52:57 <sauvin>	You want to make a jpeg out of an avi!?
Sep 16 10:57:22 <TheWild>	ok, I used GIMP
Sep 16 11:00:37 <BCMM>	TheWild: Define "raw data".
Sep 16 11:01:10 <BCMM>	there are a lot of different ways to represent image data...
Sep 16 11:01:27 <BCMM>	are you talking about native .RAW files produced by digital cameras?
Sep 16 11:02:47 <TheWild>	RAW as a... interpret this bunch of bytes as an image, but I'll decide about the width, height and the whether it is RGB or grayscale.
Sep 16 11:03:17 <BCMM>	that still leaves a lot of parameters open
Sep 16 11:04:18 <jan6>	pixel density, color encoding (possibly color space or palette too) etc
Sep 16 11:05:11 <annadane>	there isn't a way to open an image with increased brightness in feh is there
Sep 16 11:05:36 <annadane>	i've used imagemagick to brighten images but i don't really want to install that
Sep 16 11:05:41 <annadane>	i guess i have to
Sep 16 11:06:21 <jan6>	any image editor will do, but yeah...
Sep 16 11:07:03 <BCMM>	annadane: honestly i'd be kind of surprised if imagemagick wasn't already installed as a dependency of something or other
Sep 16 11:07:12 <annadane>	yeah, i get that
Sep 16 11:07:17 <annadane>	happens a lot
Sep 16 11:08:07 <annadane>	ah christ how do i call this agan
Sep 16 11:08:09 <annadane>	again
Sep 16 11:08:48 <BCMM>	the most common way to invoke imagemagick on the command line is `convert`
Sep 16 11:09:19 <TheWild>	I wanted to look at it whatever pixel density and whatever color space just to know whether it looks like actual image or something else.
Sep 16 11:09:19 <TheWild>	And it looks like blurry zeros and ones, like it was recorded from something.
Sep 16 11:09:19 <TheWild>	(X-files theme)
Sep 16 11:09:19 <TheWild>	What is this? C64 cassette dump? GSM capture?
Sep 16 11:09:19 <TheWild>	Going to write something as a practice in DSP, then maybe I'll know.
Sep 16 11:09:34 <annadane>	they couldn't have, you know. called it 'imagemagick'? =/
Sep 16 11:09:46 <BCMM>	annadane: it has other tools too
Sep 16 11:10:05 <BCMM>	annadane: also, "imagemagick" is the name of the library
Sep 16 11:10:20 <BCMM>	which is used by "convert", but also used by a *lot* of other projects that aren't part of imagemagick
Sep 16 11:11:44 <akoana>	TheWild: try:    dd if=/dev/urandom bs=10000 count=300 | display -size 100x100 RGB:-
Sep 16 11:12:39 <TheWild>	wow
Sep 16 11:12:45 <TheWild>	that one was great. Thanks.
Sep 16 11:12:50 <akoana>	TheWild: for an insight into randomness  :)
Sep 16 11:31:14 <snooky>	moin
Sep 16 11:36:37 <itt788>	it is not possible to use rename when the 'expression' starts with a dash?
Sep 16 11:37:33 <Triffid_Hunter>	itt788: use -- to separate options from filenames, eg mv -- -filewithdash somewhere/
Sep 16 11:49:49 <cornel>	hello
Sep 16 11:50:13 <cornel>	when passing the option ip=dhcp to kernel, it waits for two minutes for the link to be up
Sep 16 11:50:41 <cornel>	can we also pass an option to wait only 10 seconds?
Sep 16 11:51:05 <cornel>	is there something like ip.timeout?
Sep 16 11:53:23 <Triffid_Hunter>	cornel: kernel-managed dhcp is supposd to be used in situations where the link is permanently connected, like data centres.. it's not really designed for casual home use, or situations where the link being down isn't a grave error
Sep 16 11:54:39 <sauvin>	itt788, you'll need to figure out which version of rename you're using before that question can be answered. There are at least two.
Sep 16 11:54:46 <TJ->	cornel: also be aware sometimes the initramfs 'borrows' those kernel command-line options and does things itself based on them
Sep 16 11:57:27 <TJ->	cornel: e.g. in Debian/Ubuntu /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions::configure_networking() case dhcp|bootp|rarp|both
Sep 16 12:18:57 <TheWild>	oh gosh
Sep 16 12:19:10 <TheWild>	sudo umount /tmp/ramfs/remote
Sep 16 12:19:10 <TheWild>	remote is gone. How long it will take to unmount it?
Sep 16 12:19:21 <TheWild>	NFS is a broken protocol
Sep 16 12:20:43 <koollman>	TheWild: it works nicely for many purposes
Sep 16 12:21:31 <TheWild>	yeah... except when the server goes away
Sep 16 12:21:31 <TheWild>	I wish the monkey making NFS set the timeout to a *reasonable* value.
Sep 16 12:21:31 <TheWild>	My OS is confused for over a minute now.
Sep 16 12:21:41 <koollman>	it has a reasonable value
Sep 16 12:21:46 <TheWild>	no, it has not
Sep 16 12:21:47 <koollman>	just not for your uses :)
Sep 16 12:21:50 <koollman>	if you know the remote is gone you probably want umount -f -l
Sep 16 12:21:53 <TheWild>	doesn't work
Sep 16 12:22:11 <TheWild>	btw, remote was read-only so unmounting it should be at instant
Sep 16 12:22:38 <koollman>	it can't be instant without a remote server, since it cannot notify the remote
Sep 16 12:22:56 <TheWild>	why remote had to be notified in this case?
Sep 16 12:23:08 <TheWild>	Locking a remote file?
Sep 16 12:23:21 <koollman>	because the server maintain a list of client and file handles
Sep 16 12:23:30 <ananke>	uhmm, even tcp timeouts are much longer than 'instant'
Sep 16 12:23:35 <TheWild>	okay, 1 minute and it should be considered gone. 60 seconds is a reasonable value.
Sep 16 12:23:49 <koollman>	TheWild: reasonable for you. not for nfs designers and other users
Sep 16 12:23:57 <TheWild>	eh, "designers"
Sep 16 12:23:59 <koollman>	maybe I don't want my infrastructure to die after 1 min
Sep 16 12:24:21 <koollman>	(like, maybe my nfs server takes more than 1 minute to reboot or repair :) )
Sep 16 12:24:22 <ananke>	next time use soft mount
Sep 16 12:24:59 <koollman>	umount -l should work, though
Sep 16 12:25:04 <TheWild>	if there was a reboot then I suspect server lost all the information about locks
Sep 16 12:25:25 <koollman>	TheWild: it's not just lock (and, no, the state is, or can be, persistent)
Sep 16 12:26:06 <ananke>	lazy umount is a crutch, and it's only cosmetic
Sep 16 12:26:32 <TheWild>	never mind. My fault. I should simply use "python3 -m http.server"
Sep 16 12:26:32 <TheWild>	or SMB.
Sep 16 12:26:32 <TheWild>	I'm not sure, Samba could be broken as well.
Sep 16 12:26:32 <TheWild>	Windows somewhat can recognize that s**t is gone pretty quickly.
Sep 16 12:26:35 <koollman>	ananke: a bit more than cosmetic, it frees up the mountpoint quickly at least
Sep 16 12:27:01 <koollman>	TheWild: different protocol and goals. And indeed you could use smb
Sep 16 12:27:09 <TheWild>	I need to write additional FUSE layer, so I can break rogue mountpoints immediately.
Sep 16 12:27:23 <koollman>	how would that be different from umount -l ?
Sep 16 12:28:05 <ananke>	TheWild: why not use nfs soft mount, as designed?
Sep 16 12:28:36 <TheWild>	NFS soft mount?
Sep 16 12:28:36 <TheWild>	Where I should set it? At the server? At the client?
Sep 16 12:28:51 <ananke>	TheWild: type that in google
Sep 16 12:28:53 <TheWild>	I did "sudo mount 192.168.1.6:/media/sda4 remote"
Sep 16 12:30:41 <TheWild>	ah, "mount -o soft", okay
Sep 16 12:30:54 <TwistedFate>	what's a soft mount? lol
Sep 16 12:30:54 <TheWild>	I'll check it next time.
Sep 16 12:31:17 <TheWild>	TwistedFate: dunno, but guys convinced me this might work better than default solution.
Sep 16 12:31:44 <TheWild>	damn man, this happens when hobbyists design communication protocols
Sep 16 12:32:05 <TwistedFate>	what are you using as a smb/nfs server?
Sep 16 12:33:11 <ananke>	TheWild: this happens when hobbyists attempt to use technology without sufficient research
Sep 16 12:33:27 <TheWild>	Launch a netbook and share the stuff it has on a HDD.
Sep 16 12:33:27 <TheWild>	(the SATA adapter I bought recently was already used with another disk)
Sep 16 12:45:35 <uio>	Hello. There is printer I use sometimes that can print from flash drive. Would it possible to print directly from a laptop with some kind of usb cord? I'd like to avoid anything network related and it is pretty spotty. I want to avoid using a flash drive because it means that I have lots of files that are unprotected.
Sep 16 12:45:40 <TheWild>	ok, let's zero-fill that bad HDD. Maybe it's so slow because the platter is badly magnetized and rewriting is going to fix it?
Sep 16 12:45:40 <TheWild>	sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb status=progress        # 502 KB/s
Sep 16 12:45:40 <TheWild>	sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb status=progress bs=1M  #  60 MB/s
Sep 16 12:45:40 <TheWild>	that tremendous result makes me wonder
Sep 16 12:48:01 <uio>	Hello. There is printer I use sometimes that can print from flash drive. Would it possible to print directly from a laptop with some kind of usb cord?

Sep 16 12:55:39 <lakitu>	i'm trying to remove e.g "&lt; fladsjfldsk &gt;" instances in a file, where "fladsjfldsk" varies -- sed can't do it apparently, or not without workarounds. what's the best / a good enough way to do this in linux? some awk script?
Sep 16 12:59:17 <TJ->	lakitu: why can't sed do it? I've used sed for those situations ... maybe give more real examples and any restrictions on replacements you have
Sep 16 12:59:44 <lakitu>	ok
Sep 16 12:59:53 <zeroes>	simply question: What are common executable files, which can be found in all *nix?
Sep 16 13:00:08 <TheWild>	dmesg -w
Sep 16 13:00:08 <TheWild>	SysRq-F
Sep 16 13:00:08 <TheWild>	it's not GPU, it's again that fat ba..ard Firefox! Gotta kill a child of him.
Sep 16 13:00:09 <TheWild>	SysRq-F
Sep 16 13:00:14 <TJ->	zeroes: anything in coreutils
Sep 16 13:00:22 <lakitu>	well i need it to match just within the inner & outer parts, not the first inner part & the last (of the file, that is, 's) outer parts
Sep 16 13:00:29 <lakitu>	but sed can't do that, i read
Sep 16 13:00:44 <TJ->	lakitu:  you mean you do not want to replace the < > parts
Sep 16 13:00:45 <BCMM>	zeroes: do you mean file formats, or specific files?
Sep 16 13:00:46 <lakitu>	otherwise i'm removing almost my whole file as the match text
Sep 16 13:00:55 <lakitu>	i do want to:
Sep 16 13:01:21 <lakitu>	i want to replace "&lt; blahb alh blah &gt;" wherever they occur, where "blah blah blha" varies
Sep 16 13:01:25 <BCMM>	zeroes: many common binaries are not always in the paths that Linux users consider standard
Sep 16 13:01:26 <ananke>	TheWild: the speed difference in those dd commands is very normal
Sep 16 13:01:57 <lakitu>	but if i use sed, it will get "&lt; blah blah blah &gt; balh balhb lahb lahbh (...)" all the way to the last "&gt;"
Sep 16 13:02:01 <ananke>	zeroes: if you provide context, you can get better answers
Sep 16 13:02:10 <lakitu>	for the first match it deletes
Sep 16 13:02:20 <zeroes>	BCMM: nope, not file formats.
Sep 16 13:02:39 <TheWild>	but... such a big difference?
Sep 16 13:02:40 <TheWild>	It was never below 50 MB/s for a default bs (=512)
Sep 16 13:02:57 <TJ->	lakitu: something like this? $ echo "&lt; fladsjfldsk &gt;" | sed 's/\(&lt; \)[^&]*\( &gt;\)/\1test\2/'
Sep 16 13:03:14 <lakitu>	what if 'blah blah blah' has an &?
Sep 16 13:03:16 <ananke>	TheWild: below 32k you'll get abysmal performance
Sep 16 13:03:18 <lakitu>	'&'?
Sep 16 13:03:35 <lakitu>	i guess i can use some crazy character
Sep 16 13:03:43 <lakitu>	some unused character
Sep 16 13:03:44 <TheWild>	maybe internal disk cache got disabled or something
Sep 16 13:03:53 <lakitu>	but that requires some extra work
Sep 16 13:03:59 <ananke>	TheWild: maybe you remember it wrong
Sep 16 13:04:27 <lakitu>	it's this joke lampooning of html i'm working on, that uses all these crazy things between the <'s & >'s
Sep 16 13:04:41 <lakitu>	but i need to process it
Sep 16 13:04:45 <lakitu>	=D
Sep 16 13:06:29 <alwyn>	Hola! How common are problems with bluetooth mice in Linux? I've thried three now, and only one of them works properly. I tried fixing it manually by changing the polling rate, but no juice so far :(
Sep 16 13:06:38 <zeroes>	ananke: yeah. I have a linux in docker. I want to see what is architecture of that docker. Tried uname -m and lscpu, all gave me 64-bits. However, file /bin/bash gives 32-bits which is correct :)
Sep 16 13:07:16 <alwyn>	On different laptops as well :) (Both Dell though, so maybe it's Dell's builtin bluetooth adapter?)
Sep 16 13:07:23 <zeroes>	That is why I want to know executable files which are in all Linux, preferable in same path as well :D
Sep 16 13:07:25 <ananke>	zeroes: /bin/bash may not be present on all distros, especially small ones. /bin/sh would be a safer bet, even if it's symlinked
Sep 16 13:07:46 <lakitu>	 does anyone know how to remove all "&lt; .*? &gt;" mentions using awk from a file?
Sep 16 13:07:56 <mgolisch>	if it is a container filesystem there might be nothing in it expect for the binarie it runs
Sep 16 13:07:59 <ananke>	lakitu: #awk
Sep 16 13:08:04 <lakitu>	arg
Sep 16 13:08:24 <mgolisch>	but if it based on some distro baseimage it probably contains a shell
Sep 16 13:08:45 <alpha-carinae>	hi, my fonts are not properly anti-aliased (KDE). i connected my system to my TV thru hdmi port earlier and this started to happen. i tried toggling anti-aliasing in the fonts manager and restarting, but nothing happens.
Sep 16 13:10:03 <zeroes>	ananke: Okay. Thanks for the better answer ;)
Sep 16 13:15:28 <lakitu>	actually that doesn't even work, because it still deletes from the first first-part to the last-last part, ("&lt;" and "&gt;" being the parts) rather than from the first "&lt;" to the first "&gt;"
Sep 16 13:15:41 <lakitu>	so its basically removing my whole file's content when i do that, instead
Sep 16 13:16:18 <lakitu>	it's not mission critical
Sep 16 13:16:38 <lakitu>	hard to explain - not just some forwarded email joke either
Sep 16 13:17:05 <lakitu>	somewhere between Love & Art & comedy -- the priority of this endeavor =)
Sep 16 13:17:37 <lakitu>	((endeavour))
Sep 16 13:21:32 <alpha-carinae>	is this some kind of a bug in KDE?
Sep 16 13:21:58 <alpha-carinae>	haven't tried logging into other desktop environments though
Sep 16 13:23:48 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Sep 16 13:24:12 <alpha-carinae>	anyone have any idea why this is happening? googling didn't help so far :(
Sep 16 13:24:46 <lakitu>	kate did it ok
Sep 16 13:27:11 <triceratux>	alpha-carinae: you dont need to check against other DEs right away. try booting a liveiso of the kde to see if the issue is persistent in the hardware or persistent in the plasma install
Sep 16 13:28:19 <alpha-carinae>	im sure everything would be fine when i boot into a live medium triceratux
Sep 16 13:29:33 <triceratux>	something is stuck then. plasma did it to themselves
Sep 16 13:29:52 <alpha-carinae>	yeah, there's no update too
Sep 16 13:30:13 <alpha-carinae>	it suddenly happened when i connected my laptop to the TV
Sep 16 13:30:28 <alpha-carinae>	didn't happen before either, wondering what the reason might be
Sep 16 13:30:42 <BCMM>	alpha-carinae: is it definitely just a font issue? if the TV was doing scaling, for example, it would produce aliasing artifacts that can look a lot like bad font AA.
Sep 16 13:31:32 <alpha-carinae>	BCMM, i disconnected from the TV, it happens on my laptop screen too
Sep 16 13:31:36 <BCMM>	ah, right
Sep 16 13:38:32 <itt788>	Triffid_Hunter: i said "rename"
Sep 16 13:39:15 <fling>	Should I use luks2?
Sep 16 13:39:36 <Triffid_Hunter>	itt788: that works with basically all terminal commands, and I use 'mv' for renaming things
Sep 16 13:40:41 <alpha-carinae>	update: everything looks ugly except websites that (probably) host their own fonts
Sep 16 13:41:14 <alpha-carinae>	so, fonts.google.com looks fine if i select a custom font and test it
Sep 16 13:41:24 <alpha-carinae>	but the other parts look horrible
Sep 16 15:45:11 *	Disconnected ()

Sep 16 15:46:14 <billings>	I don't really have the best advice, been using linux since the late 90s and never use windows, so I don't have a great perspective on what new users exerience
Sep 16 15:46:23 <triceratux>	ALowther: personally i prefer distros that go ahead & say: "this is the desktop we prefer" (as long as its not gnome of course) & then have gone out of their way to ensure its a seamless wellconfigured experience
Sep 16 15:46:23 <pwn>	kerframil: i dont have nanosecond support anyways
Sep 16 15:46:53 <Zireael07>	and we'd like the bell for twofold reason: one, audible bell annoys both her and others in the room, and two, I am hearing impaired so I can't hear the bell anyway, and I'm the go-to computer expert for Linux in the house since I'm the only one to have used it xD xD
Sep 16 15:47:08 <billings>	yeah, Fedora's main release uses GDM, but it has KDE, XFCE and MATE spins
Sep 16 15:47:37 <allizom>	billings: this is from ps: "/usr/libexec/Xorg -nolisten tcp -auth /var/run/sddm/{19631944-6423-4542-bd1c-4bd3092f5547} -background none -noreset -displayfd 18 -seat seat0 vt1"
Sep 16 15:47:39 <billings>	xset b 0
Sep 16 15:47:47 <billings>	allizom: there you go!
Sep 16 15:47:51 <Zireael07>	I don
Sep 16 15:47:52 <billings>	weird name for a file though
Sep 16 15:48:08 <ALowther>	triceratux: What do you dislike about Gnome?
Sep 16 15:48:14 <allizom>	it looks like it may be a temporary file though
Sep 16 15:48:23 <triceratux>	i say that because it eliminates that heartbreaking moment where you have to say Fedora ? Ubuntu ? surely they have an Xfce spin. what can they have been thinking ?
Sep 16 15:48:34 <alpha-carinae>	triceratux, i'm still stuck with the aliasing problem :(
Sep 16 15:48:36 <Zireael07>	oops, enter pressed - I don't know MATE (will be checking out on that lovely site), but I am currently rocking Cinnamon on Ubuntu and loving it
Sep 16 15:48:51 <akik>	i like fedora because they have both plasma and mate spins
Sep 16 15:48:54 <billings>	MATE is like GNOME 2 only against modern libraries
Sep 16 15:49:14 *	billings remembers when fvwm95 was cool
Sep 16 15:49:39 <billings>	and if you were really good at stuff, Enlightenment worked.  sometimes.
Sep 16 15:50:27 <Zireael07>	not a good thing to hear from someone who is looking at Bodhi Linux website xD
Sep 16 15:50:37 <Zireael07>	*for, not from
Sep 16 15:50:37 <triceratux>	ALowther: nothing wrong with gnome. in fact it keeps the gnome devs away from xfce & the qt desktops. except when theyre maintaining libpango of course
Sep 16 15:51:13 <akik>	heh
Sep 16 15:51:24 <Zireael07>	gnome, at least the customized version in Ubuntu, does can get sluggish (the reason why I moved to Cinnamon)
Sep 16 15:51:50 <alpha-carinae>	some screenshots: https://i.imgur.com/th5CBDL.png, https://i.imgur.com/GLwN3Bh.png
Sep 16 15:51:51 <triceratux>	alpha-carinae: the next thing id try is plug in an external non-hdmi monitor & see if the effect is confined to the laptop screen
Sep 16 15:52:15 <alpha-carinae>	sad i don't have one :(
Sep 16 15:52:31 <alpha-carinae>	i tried connecting and disconnecting again to the TV though
Sep 16 15:53:39 <akik>	ALowther: gnome project is well known for removing features
Sep 16 15:54:04 <billings>	wayland support is nice, though
Sep 16 15:55:28 <Sc0tty->	is there a way to enable xterm mouse reporting on mint?
Sep 16 15:56:02 <Lope>	dianni, I don't use any separate things. I only phrase the question that way because some people do.
Sep 16 15:56:26 <Lope>	dianni, I do exactly as you recommend already. All the usual stuff in root and then data separate.
Sep 16 15:58:03 <triceratux>	ALowther: fact is you have to look at the base. zorinos & trisquel are still shipping their original images. theyre Xenial 16.04 based with glibc 2.23. they look like ordinary ubuntu desktops but in 2019 they cant be used for much in the real world. centos is even older. youd use it only because you think as a server its more stable than a bsd
Sep 16 15:59:24 <triceratux>	centos really is still on a 3.10 kernel. thats older than jessie
Sep 16 15:59:49 <akik>	triceratux: ubuntu 16.04 support goes up to 2021
Sep 16 16:01:16 <branded>	what do you do if there's no sound after you wake up from a suspension? It usually randomly comes back after a minute, but not this time. Nothing in the log.
Sep 16 16:01:16 <triceratux>	yeah im being a bit harsh on trisquel. i booted it yesterday & it takes me back to the simpler times of 16.04 :)
Sep 16 16:07:17 <triceratux>	on the other hand, zorin went ahead & updated all the way to 16.04.5 which because of the hardware enablement stack makes it look like an 18.04 even tho it isnt. so you have to wonder about a project that cant get to the next lts
Sep 16 16:07:57 <drzacek>	hello there
Sep 16 16:08:10 <twainwek>	why hallo thar
Sep 16 16:08:16 <drzacek>	so a rsync is a cool thingy that lets me copy stuff from A to B
Sep 16 16:08:18 <triceratux>	it could be considered an adroit move as it gives the 16.04 users a 4.15.0 kernel
Sep 16 16:08:25 <ALowther>	triceratux: So CentOS is still using Linux kernel 3.10 even though the kernel is now up to 5.x?
Sep 16 16:08:54 <drzacek>	so here's a question - what's with symbolic links? Those thingies you make with ln -s? How are those retained?
Sep 16 16:09:06 <drzacek>	They do point to hardwired PATH, right?
Sep 16 16:09:13 <mgolisch>	that was probably semi current at the time this rhel release came out
Sep 16 16:09:31 <drzacek>	What I want to achieve - on my dev system create symlinks to various paths that might not exist there, but surely exist on the target system
Sep 16 16:09:54 <triceratux>	ALowther: yep theyre not in an active development cycle. theyre rebranding the last sound redhat for free software use. so no theyre not as adroit as an ubuntu or an arch if youre trying to get broadcomm working o.O
Sep 16 16:09:54 <drzacek>	will those be copied (the links, not the things the point to) with plain rsync -a or cp -r ?
Sep 16 16:11:40 <ALowther>	triceratux: There just seem to be SO MANY different linux distributions, I'm trying to better understand the purpose for each one and which would be best for me in different scenarios. i.e. desktop vs server vs toy-play-thing-server, etc.
Sep 16 16:13:45 <triceratux>	ALowther: yep. you just have to get on distrowatch & start comparing. they look the same from the outside, but their differences arise from their origins. a new distro or a new release never falls far from the tree https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg
Sep 16 16:15:32 <drzacek>	ALowther, just go with debian
Sep 16 16:15:41 <ALowther>	triceratux: I've used Fedora, CentOS on VPSes and others, like Kali, Ubuntu on desktop. I've never really noticed a difference other than different package managers or different tools that aren't shipped with the distro. Maybe I've not gone deep enough.
Sep 16 16:15:50 <drzacek>	we can all compare all dem distros month long, but we always end up with the one that just works
Sep 16 16:16:07 <ALowther>	drzacek: I was reading about Debian last night, which is what sparked this thought in my head.
Sep 16 16:16:34 <drzacek>	ALowther, the biggest difference is in number of available of packages (big distros are comparable in that matter I think), and community support
Sep 16 16:17:00 <drzacek>	if you find some indie distro, that appeals to you, it's cool, but those 3 dude on its irc channel won't help you as good as those with 500+ user channels
Sep 16 16:17:02 <drzacek>	or good forum
Sep 16 16:18:14 <ALowther>	drzacek: So the main things might be keeping up with the latest linux kernel - which likely gives better and newer hardware support and packages actually maintained by the distro team - which likely gives better support than a 3rd party package maintainer?
Sep 16 16:19:48 <drzacek>	well I compiled kernel on my own, cause the default 4.9 from debian was too old for me (+ I needed few extra features). So even if you won't find perfect distro out-of-the-box for you, there's a lot you can do to tailor it to you
Sep 16 16:21:18 <tds>	drzacek: backports kernel not new and shiny enough either?
Sep 16 16:21:59 <drzacek>	tds, their realtime kernels weren't working on my system
Sep 16 16:22:10 <drzacek>	had to tweak some stuff
Sep 16 16:23:07 <inad922>	Hello
Sep 16 16:23:18 <inad922>	Is there a way to print fields bigger than a certain number with awk?
Sep 16 16:23:36 <inad922>	I mean I want to print fields 6, 7, etc or omit the first 5
Sep 16 16:24:44 <ALowther>	drzacek: You can compile your own kernel and then take everything else the distro has to offer and piece it together?
Sep 16 16:25:01 <drzacek>	ALowther, of course
Sep 16 16:25:40 <jim>	inad922, I guess you could sort them, then print the first few numbers until it's less than certain number
Sep 16 16:26:59 <ALowther>	drzacek: I did not know that. That's good to know. The way I look at an OS - which is maybe a bit naive, it's just the best understanding I have at the moment - is that it consists of a kernel and the packages to interact with it(the kernel) and files/resources....So I can compile my own kernel and then choose, from whichever distribution I want, what I consider to be the best maintained packages and then piece those together?
Sep 16 16:27:43 <jim>	inad922, are the numbers arranged in some kind of tabular form?
Sep 16 16:27:48 <mgolisch>	sure but why even do that? the distro packaged kernels usualy work fine
Sep 16 16:28:41 <vai>	compile to make it work on ISA 486 box
Sep 16 16:31:42 <drzacek>	ALowther, other way around, you choose the distro that appeals to you/you think is the best, and if the provided kernel is not for you, you either compile yourself or look for other versions
Sep 16 16:32:17 <spomata>	hi all, I'm creating a script to run some EDA tools (electronic design) and I've noticed some process is turning off echo in the bash console, leaving it off at the exit. Is there a way to track which process is responsible for it / preventing it from happening altogether? The script is basically a python script kicking some subprocesses
Sep 16 16:33:25 <drzacek>	ALowther, in essence you are right - an OS IS a kernel with shell and programs, but compiling of the linux kernel is relatively easy, while managing the system as a whole is more complex, keeping track of installed software, if dependencies are met, etc etc.
Sep 16 16:36:19 <ALowther>	drzacek: But with a system always being limited by the kernel, the ability to easily compile whichever version of the kernel you want is incredible and then from there take advantage of whichever distro gives you the programs you want?
Sep 16 16:37:10 <drzacek>	depends on how you define "limited by". All the higher system functions are realized by other programs
Sep 16 16:37:42 <drzacek>	also, maybe important thing to consider when choosing (at least for some), do you want systemd or not
Sep 16 16:37:56 <darkxploit>	any time for linux sys admin interviews ?
Sep 16 16:38:01 <darkxploit>	tips*
Sep 16 16:38:26 <ALowther>	drzacek: Vs init?
Sep 16 16:39:09 <drzacek>	yeah
Sep 16 16:39:25 <drzacek>	though finding a systemd-less distro might be hard, especially among bigger ones
Sep 16 16:39:45 <akk>	There are lots of systemd-free distros.
Sep 16 16:39:57 <drzacek>	akk, any major ones that offer that out of the box?
Sep 16 16:40:32 <akk>	drzacek: No, as far as I know all the major distros use systemd, and then people make systemd-free forks of them
Sep 16 16:40:47 <akk>	or else you use a major distro and install a different init package, which I know you can do in debian
Sep 16 16:40:47 <drzacek>	akk, exactly
Sep 16 16:40:56 <akk>	I can only assume it's equally easy on the other majors.
Sep 16 16:41:00 <drzacek>	well I'm fine with systemd for now
Sep 16 16:41:10 *	akk hasn't actually done this, but is on LUG lists with lots of people who do
Sep 16 16:41:18 <drzacek>	but I know there was quite evangelical discussion about this some time ago
Sep 16 16:41:31 <akk>	I don't see the point of a linux newbie avoiding systemd, that's sort of an esoteric thing to do anyway.
Sep 16 16:41:42 <drzacek>	I agree
Sep 16 16:41:44 <ALowther>	drzacek: So, I see Buster ships with 4.19 - if you wanted, you could compile the latest kernel on your own, replace the provided 4.19 and leave all else the same?
Sep 16 16:41:56 <drzacek>	exactly
Sep 16 16:42:07 <drzacek>	but is there any reason for you to replace the 4.19?
Sep 16 16:42:17 <tds>	if you were happy with it, you could also grab 5.2 from buster-backports :)
Sep 16 16:42:21 <akk>	ALowther: You can even have lots of different kernels installed on the same system, and reboot into whichever one you're in the mood for.
Sep 16 16:42:27 <akk>	(I'm not sure why you'd do that, but you could)
Sep 16 16:42:58 <drzacek>	akk, well, if filesystem is not unmounted properly, that's usually the first thing that gets borked
Sep 16 16:43:03 <ALowther>	drzacek: Not that I know of - I'm more speaking from a perspective of what is possible rather than from what I am going to go do. I couldn't tell you the difference between what is included in 4.19 vs 5.x to make an educated decision to replace it. If I did, it would just be for a learning experience.
Sep 16 16:43:03 *	akk hasn't compiled a kernel in maybe 7 years, there's always some distro kernel that works well enough
Sep 16 16:43:08 <drzacek>	so booting to other kernel is a chance to boot into broken system
Sep 16 16:43:45 <drzacek>	well, there's some fun in compiling kernel, surely nice to learn stuff, and you get some nerd points
Sep 16 16:43:53 <drzacek>	but if you don't need it, stick with what distro provides
Sep 16 16:43:59 <drzacek>	it's usually the fool-proof solution
Sep 16 16:44:02 <akk>	Usually if you're compiling a kernel, it's because you have some special experimental driver or scheduler or something that you want to use.
Sep 16 16:44:03 <jim>	inad922, or do you mean fields whose number is larger than a certain number? and you wouldn't need to sort if it's that
Sep 16 16:44:07 <akik>	spomata: bpftrace can show you all processes executed on your system
Sep 16 16:44:24 <akk>	(or, of course, you just want to learn how to compile a kernel, which is certainly a valid reason too)
Sep 16 16:44:25 <drzacek>	also I think by sticking to the official kernel, you get security updates in casethey find some problems, while on custom kernel you're on your own
Sep 16 16:45:35 <drzacek>	well if you don't break your linux system at least few times in the beginning, to the point that only format helps, are you even trying?
Sep 16 16:45:49 <akk>	haha yeah
Sep 16 16:45:55 <drzacek>	I know my first experiences were just that - I wanted to learn linux the hard way, but rather being humble I went #yolo
Sep 16 16:46:03 <jim>	(there was a time when compiling your own kernel was required, possibly to get support for some device, or filesystem)
Sep 16 16:46:09 <drzacek>	"what do you mean I can't do that and need root rights?"
Sep 16 16:46:26 <drzacek>	sudo chown -R drzacek:drzacek /
Sep 16 16:46:31 <drzacek>	somehow it didn't worked
Sep 16 16:46:43 <akk>	"what do you mean I should be cautious in what I do as root?"
Sep 16 16:46:45 <jim>	drzacek, chown is a root-only operation
Sep 16 16:47:14 <drzacek>	I think I was 14yo then? I knew I was extremely annoyed by the fact I wasn't able to do anything
Sep 16 16:47:30 <jim>	drzacek, and, that particular invocation of chown will destroy your system
Sep 16 16:47:44 <drzacek>	and while I could switch to root in terminal, my file manager couldn't copy/move/remove things, so I wanted to make it easier for me :D
Sep 16 16:47:47 <akk>	I thought that was drzacek's point
Sep 16 16:47:55 <drzacek>	jim, that exactly what happened
Sep 16 16:48:20 <drzacek>	tbh it didn't even chowned the whole /, it stopped working mid through
Sep 16 16:48:22 <jim>	you'll probably need to reinstall your linux distribution
Sep 16 16:48:30 <drzacek>	jim, and that exactly what happened
Sep 16 16:48:34 <jim>	or restore from your backups
Sep 16 16:48:53 <jim>	oh ok
Sep 16 16:48:59 <drzacek>	and during that reinstall, I learned the hardway, that it didn't formatted the / partition before installing it new :D
Sep 16 16:49:18 <drzacek>	or was it /home and others?
Sep 16 16:49:31 <drzacek>	can't say, it was over 10 years ago
Sep 16 16:49:45 <jim>	well with some dists, you can tell it to format or to not format
Sep 16 16:49:45 <drzacek>	damn, closer to 20 than 10
Sep 16 16:49:55 <drzacek>	jim, I know
Sep 16 16:50:08 <drzacek>	but I didn't know that when I first started with linux
Sep 16 16:50:25 <drzacek>	I think after 5th format and reinstall I actually got it right
Sep 16 16:50:32 <jim>	oh, you're describing something that happened years ago?
Sep 16 16:50:39 <drzacek>	yep
Sep 16 16:51:01 <drzacek>	just wanted to say that it is perfectly healthy and normal to bork your system in the beginning
Sep 16 16:51:15 <drzacek>	and it also has a great learning value too
Sep 16 16:51:30 <jim>	about that particular chown command you posted... it's destructive, and I'd prefer if you didn't post those kinds of commands :)
Sep 16 16:51:35 <Electric_Sheep>	failure is a part of learning
Sep 16 16:51:49 <jim>	yep, glad you perservered
Sep 16 16:52:11 <drzacek>	jim, yeah I can see how this might be dangerous
Sep 16 16:52:23 <jim>	thanks
Sep 16 16:52:25 <drzacek>	but I clearly stated that this was harmfull, so I hope no one trie that at home
Sep 16 16:52:33 <drzacek>	*try
Sep 16 16:52:37 <jim>	heh :) me too
Sep 16 16:53:19 <drzacek>	nowadays it's not that hard, cause modern windowses also have user accounts, and restrictions, and normal user can't do everything
Sep 16 16:53:44 <drzacek>	but I was coming from windows 98 / early XP era, and the idea of not being able to do something was something abstract
Sep 16 16:54:02 <drzacek>	also was a kid with nothing to lose so I experimented
Sep 16 16:54:17 <drzacek>	tbh I thought I was really clever when I run that chown command
Sep 16 16:54:28 <drzacek>	boy was I wrong
Sep 16 16:55:02 <jim>	the good thing is you know now, and maybe it's good to tell that story
Sep 16 16:55:51 <drzacek>	glad I could share it
Sep 16 16:56:03 <ALowther>	drzacek: ʘ‿ʘ
Sep 16 16:56:04 *	drzacek takes his place back at LinuxUsersAnonymous
Sep 16 16:59:28 <drzacek>	what I don't understand
Sep 16 16:59:42 <drzacek>	back in early 2000s we had lots of micro distros
Sep 16 17:00:23 <drzacek>	lots of cool linuxes that could fit on USB drives (yeah, they were smaller back then), ~50mb, few more feature-packed <100mb
Sep 16 17:00:27 <drzacek>	but those are all gone
Sep 16 17:00:39 <drzacek>	no need for them anymore?
Sep 16 17:02:58 <Soo_Slow>	I wound be actually glad to have some extra-smol linux to use in virtualization (since Im that weirdo who run web browser in virtual machine)
Sep 16 17:03:01 <tuxick>	i'm sure they're around
Sep 16 17:03:11 <tuxick>	there's like 2 million linux dists out there now
Sep 16 17:03:28 <tuxick>	for some reason newbies go out of their way to find the most obscure ones
Sep 16 17:03:30 <akk>	There are still a few around.
Sep 16 17:03:32 <tuxick>	and then ask for help
Sep 16 17:03:38 <dianni>	Check out Alpine linux a container is like 8MB
Sep 16 17:05:20 <drzacek>	dianni, looks interesting, gonna look into that
Sep 16 17:05:29 <Soo_Slow>	dianni, thanks, will do

Sep 17 10:25:00 <iflema>	Styil ^
Sep 17 10:25:28 <Styil>	?
Sep 17 10:25:33 <Styil>	what?
Sep 17 10:25:40 <rouji>	having a stronk?
Sep 17 10:25:54 <iflema>	repairman? should have something bootable
Sep 17 10:26:21 <iflema>	drive oiut
Sep 17 10:26:43 *	iflema pulls handbrake
Sep 17 10:27:03 <rouji>	if the drive's encrypted, I'd not even bother wiping it
Sep 17 10:27:17 <rouji>	and on mobile devices, it really should be
Sep 17 10:27:31 <iflema>	is?
Sep 17 10:27:34 <Styil>	well aware, ill just reinstall windows or something on it to give them something to work withb
Sep 17 10:27:49 <Styil>	my home directory is encrypted anyways on my linux partition and windows has bootlocker
Sep 17 10:27:49 <rouji>	they really should have a bootable usb stick or something
Sep 17 10:27:52 <Styil>	bitlocker
Sep 17 10:27:56 <Styil>	I imagine they do
Sep 17 10:28:08 <rouji>	don't do their work for them
Sep 17 10:28:22 <Styil>	fair
Sep 17 10:28:25 <rouji>	dd backup should work fine
Sep 17 10:28:33 <rouji>	just in case they mess up
Sep 17 10:28:41 <geirha>	dd to make image of the drive, wipe with zeros, install Windows ME, send to repair
Sep 17 10:29:09 <Styil>	no need to wipe with zeros if the encryption keys are shot
Sep 17 10:30:00 <iflema>	mikeos
Sep 17 10:30:29 <iflema>	kali
Sep 17 10:30:30 <geirha>	or perhaps templeOS
Sep 17 10:30:36 <iflema>	get a sticker
Sep 17 10:30:52 <rouji>	I used to be a hacker but then I took an OS to the temple
Sep 17 10:31:33 <paulcarroty>	to be a hacker like in watch dogs?
Sep 17 10:31:59 <paulcarroty>	LOL
Sep 17 10:32:01 <rouji>	sure, why not
Sep 17 10:32:03 <dka>	I am trying to install windows 10 on VMware but I have vmware  windows setup installing windows status copying windows files (0%)
Sep 17 10:32:19 <paulcarroty>	#windows
Sep 17 10:35:07 <iflema>	wait
Sep 17 10:38:11 <Styil>	rouji: do you know how /dev/nvme* naming schemes work
Sep 17 10:38:21 <Styil>	nvme0 is clearly the first nvme drive
Sep 17 10:38:28 <Styil>	but why are there n and p values
Sep 17 10:38:36 <Styil>	nvme0n1p1 for instance
Sep 17 10:38:44 <knstn>	namespace and partition number
Sep 17 10:38:53 <Styil>	namespace?
Sep 17 10:39:28 <knstn>	a nvme could have multiple namespaces, and it's namespace multiple partition, theoritically
Sep 17 10:39:42 <knstn>	s/it's/each
Sep 17 10:39:43 <Styil>	but what is a namespace?
Sep 17 10:39:49 <Styil>	first I've heard of it
Sep 17 10:40:30 <knstn>	it's a common term in CS. google it. it can have "various" meanings under specific context
Sep 17 10:40:51 <Styil>	aware of it in say C++, first time I have heard of it in the context of drives
Sep 17 10:41:05 <knstn>	systemd has namespaces too
Sep 17 10:41:15 <Styil>	more importantly, if I wanted to do a full disk backup, which device file would I dd
Sep 17 10:41:19 <Styil>	nvme0?
Sep 17 10:41:25 <Styil>	or nvme0n0
Sep 17 10:41:34 <Styil>	I assume the former but just checking
Sep 17 10:41:37 <knstn>	depends what you want to backup
Sep 17 10:41:52 <knstn>	for full, "nvme0"
Sep 17 10:42:59 <Styil>	what would nvme0n0 not back up that nvme0 would?
Sep 17 10:45:01 <knstn>	it probably would, but it would cripple out data structure. If you want to "ghost" it go with nvme0
Sep 17 10:48:01 <Styil>	one last question knstn, what should I choose as my blocksize in this case?
Sep 17 11:16:44 <jkwki>	hi, does anyone know how to disable echoing input in zsh? i want to suppress printing ^E and ^Y when mouse scrolling.
Sep 17 11:17:32 <ryszard>	hey
Sep 17 11:18:22 <ryszard>	by: "readelf -p 25 <binaryelf>" I can read section header string table of the binaryelf
Sep 17 11:18:41 <ryszard>	and those are files like .bss .text and so on
Sep 17 11:18:45 <ryszard>	I mean sections
Sep 17 11:18:57 <ryszard>	but now how can I write those section to separate files ?
Sep 17 11:43:45 <chazapp>	hi ppl, anyone know how to download older versions of MongoDB Compass ?
Sep 17 11:44:13 <chazapp>	I got this bug that's driving me insane: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47456910/mongodb-compass-loading-forever

Sep 17 12:00:16 <ttmx>	Hey guys, very simply I'm trying to tunnel my minecraft connection through ssh since we only have a couple of whitelisted ports in our uni(one of them being ssh port)
Sep 17 12:01:03 <ttmx>	I've tried `ssh -L 25565:serverIP:25565 myHome'sIP` and then connecting to localhost on minecraft client
Sep 17 12:01:17 <ttmx>	That doesn't seem to work though...
Sep 17 12:05:22 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: it probably uses UDP, ssh only tunnels TCP
Sep 17 12:05:47 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: you'd need to set up some sort of vpn tunnel over your ssh link so you can stuff udp packets through it
Sep 17 12:06:11 <ttmx>	It supposedly only uses TCP?
Sep 17 12:06:44 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: most games use UDP for update frames, but might use either TCP or UDP for map downloads, lobby chat, etc
Sep 17 12:07:02 <nQk>	Hi, I'm looking for a command line banking software that supports new EU PSD 2 regulation
Sep 17 12:07:05 <Triffid_Hunter>	I don't know specifically what minecraft does, but online guides suggest it uses both
Sep 17 12:07:10 <qman__>	minecraft uses a single TCP port
Sep 17 12:07:18 <ttmx>	I'm aware since UDP has a lower overhead
Sep 17 12:07:34 <ttmx>	I remember port forwarding a long time ago and I only needed TCP
Sep 17 12:07:38 <qman__>	it also uses SRV records to locate servers, though
Sep 17 12:08:17 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: does the server bind to a single ip, or listen on 0.0.0.0? you might need to tweak the serverip if it only binds to one address
Sep 17 12:08:51 <ttmx>	I sadly have no idea what that means :(
Sep 17 12:08:58 <charolastra>	how to find the used DNS server; but not through /etc/resolv.conf?
Sep 17 12:09:15 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: lsof -i -n | grep LISTEN, find minecraft, see if it's listening on 192.168.something or 0.0.0.0
Sep 17 12:09:31 <Triffid_Hunter>	charolastra: ask whatever your /etc/resolv.conf points at
Sep 17 12:09:49 <charolastra>	there is no /etc/resolv.conf. this is android
Sep 17 12:10:00 <ttmx>	I don't have lsof xD
Sep 17 12:10:10 <qman__>	ttmx: you should have netstat or ss
Sep 17 12:10:35 <Triffid_Hunter>	charolastra: then go check your mobile data or wifi settings
Sep 17 12:10:46 <qman__>	ttmx: netstat -tpln | grep 25565
Sep 17 12:10:55 <ttmx>	thx
Sep 17 12:11:15 <qman__>	ss takes the same arguments, if that's what you have
Sep 17 12:11:35 <charolastra>	Triffid_Hunter: this is after creating a VPN tunnel device. afaik that doesn't show in the network settings
Sep 17 12:11:43 <ttmx>	tcp and tcp 6
Sep 17 12:12:34 <qman__>	it should show the listen address, which could be ::: for tcp6, meaning all addresses
Sep 17 12:12:59 <chazapp>	ttmx: why host your minecraft server on your uni's instances ? Sign up at Google Cloud Platform, you can have $300 credit, which amounts to about a year of hosting on a big machine
Sep 17 12:13:05 <chazapp>	I do that for my own minecraft server
Sep 17 12:13:11 <ttmx>	https://pastebin.com/raw/APvdeLkK
Sep 17 12:13:18 <ttmx>	Oh wait
Sep 17 12:13:30 <ttmx>	I'm trying to connect to a server that is outside university
Sep 17 12:13:44 <ttmx>	And I'm inside uni
Sep 17 12:13:55 <qman__>	so, that one's 26654, so make sure you're on the right port
Sep 17 12:14:03 <ttmx>	Thats on purpose yes
Sep 17 12:14:52 <ttmx>	"ssh -L 25564:hypixel.net:25565 name@homeip" is what I did
Sep 17 12:15:05 <qman__>	that's backwards
Sep 17 12:15:31 <qman__>	if the minecraft server is listening on 25564, it should be the right side port
Sep 17 12:15:38 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: why are you trying to connect to 'hypixel.net' from the remote end? shouldn't it be localhost?
Sep 17 12:17:24 <ttmx>	nonono
Sep 17 12:17:34 <ttmx>	I'm trying to connect to hp.net from inside uni
Sep 17 12:17:39 <ttmx>	Through my home server
Sep 17 12:18:01 <ttmx>	The connection should go:   Laptop(in uni) -> Home server -> hp.net
Sep 17 12:18:19 <ttmx>	The server is listening in 25565
Sep 17 12:18:30 <ttmx>	And I'm connecting to localhost:25564
Sep 17 12:19:03 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: I guess that should work then
Sep 17 12:19:42 <qman__>	ok, in that case, there's one other possible wrench here
Sep 17 12:19:42 <ttmx>	But it doesnt :(
Sep 17 12:19:47 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: you could always fire up some packet capture with wireshark or iptables or whatever to see if any packets are actually leaving your home machine for the gameserver
Sep 17 12:20:12 <qman__>	make sure that hypixel.net actually points at the minecraft server - minecraft uses SRV records, so a given name can direct you to a different server than the A record for minecraft
Sep 17 12:20:14 <ttmx>	I'm not sure what to do
Sep 17 12:20:19 <ttmx>	I think I've made it work before
Sep 17 12:20:49 <ttmx>	I've connected to hypixel.net when outside uni
Sep 17 12:20:53 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: ensure AllowTcpForwarding is enabled on your home sshd
Sep 17 12:20:58 <qwedfg>	try telnetting to the port to see if it listens on that localhost
Sep 17 12:21:07 <qwedfg>	and then if it listens on the other homeserver
Sep 17 12:21:20 <ttmx>	Its the ip I have in my normal server config xd
Sep 17 12:21:21 <ttmx>	To which port?
Sep 17 12:21:30 <qwedfg>	and then if not then maybe you got the tunnel wrong
Sep 17 12:21:40 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: try forwarding to google.com:80 then stuff a http request down there to see if it works
Sep 17 12:21:47 <ttmx>	How do I AllowTcoForwarding?
Sep 17 12:21:56 <ttmx>	lemme see
Sep 17 12:22:17 <qman__>	ttmx: I was right - the minecraft server is not at hypixel.net:
Sep 17 12:22:40 <ttmx>	Yupps, it goes to google
Sep 17 12:22:44 <qman__>	ttmx: dig srv _minecraft.tcp.hypixel.net
Sep 17 12:22:44 <qman__>	_minecraft.tcp.hypixel.net. 120	IN	CNAME	mc.hypixel.net.
Sep 17 12:22:50 <ttmx>	Wait
Sep 17 12:23:20 <ttmx>	So thats why the exact same thing worked with my other servers!
Sep 17 12:23:21 <ttmx>	Hypixel has a weird infrastructure cause of its size
Sep 17 12:23:29 <ttmx>	Man I feel like a kid again
Sep 17 12:23:40 <qman__>	it's not a weird infrastructure, this is how minecraft is meant to be set up
Sep 17 12:23:43 <ttmx>	How would I fwd that then?
Sep 17 12:23:48 <qman__>	it uses SRV records
Sep 17 12:24:06 <qman__>	the SRV record tells the game the actual server, which in this case is mc.hypixel.net
Sep 17 12:24:20 <qman__>	so connect to that, it should work
Sep 17 12:24:29 <ttmx>	Uhh
Sep 17 12:24:37 <ttmx>	But does ssh accept those kinds of subdomains?
Sep 17 12:24:53 <qman__>	SSH doesn't care, it doesn't use domains, it uses IPs
Sep 17 12:24:58 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: ssh doesn't care, it just hands it to glibc
Sep 17 12:25:11 <qman__>	when you specify a domain name, the remote server does a DNS lookup to determine the IP
Sep 17 12:25:18 <ttmx>	It workde lmao
Sep 17 12:25:29 <ttmx>	Wait, is mc.hp.net a different ip to hp.net?
Sep 17 12:25:36 <qman__>	yes
Sep 17 12:25:58 <qman__>	i.e., they are probably not hosting the actual minecraft server on the same IP as the web server
Sep 17 12:26:12 <knstn>	Oh snap, thunderbird 68 just got fast
Sep 17 12:26:27 <rascul>	and still no tray icon :(
Sep 17 12:26:46 <Triffid_Hunter>	ttmx: yeah, tld is 104.18 but mc (cname -> r53) is a long long list of 172.65 addresses
Sep 17 12:27:23 <BCMM>	rascul: there are quite a few third-party tools to make that happen, though
Sep 17 12:27:30 <rascul>	none of which work here
Sep 17 12:27:38 <BCMM>	is "here" gnome?
Sep 17 12:27:42 <rascul>	kde
Sep 17 12:28:02 <rascul>	i've tried kdocker, birdsomething, and another one i can't recall and none actually give me a tray icon...
Sep 17 12:28:14 <ttmx>	It works hahaha
Sep 17 12:28:21 <ttmx>	Thank you :)
Sep 17 12:28:39 <ttmx>	Here I am big boi using a r c h b t w but trying to play minecraft in uni and asking for help in linux irc
Sep 17 12:29:18 <BCMM>	rascul: huh, i thought kdocker ought to work with, like, anything that makes a window
Sep 17 12:31:33 <rascul>	BCMM maybe it's something on my system? i dunno, i didn't give much time to it, claws-mail works fine for me
Sep 17 12:31:39 <rascul>	gotta head out to work now
Sep 17 12:31:58 <natten>	Anyone got any suggestions why this request just sits there until it times out when running from google cloud function but not from local?
Sep 17 12:31:59 <natten>	Curl from cloud function -> https://hastebin.com/xijisizono.txt
Sep 17 12:32:54 <BCMM>	rascul: hmm, i might look in to claws. i'm getting bored of waiting for kmail to get good again.
Sep 17 12:42:25 <cluem1nati>	hello, i have a question regarding an issue im having with my hard drive. ive tried to repair it with fsck, it seemed to have done more damange than anything to my filesystem. smart status says passed. im in the process of running a ddrescue of the main partition to an img file before attempting to wipe it and start from scratch.  since smart status is passed, is it expected that i can just repartition and
Sep 17 12:42:26 <cluem1nati>	use the drive again?  thanks
Sep 17 12:43:19 <gry>	how do you know that it is your hard drive, then?
Sep 17 12:44:18 <Blondie101010>	good question...  saying that one would repair a drive with `fsck` supposes that they do not understand the difference between the hardware and software layers
Sep 17 12:44:23 <cluem1nati>	oops, got disconnected, still here
Sep 17 12:44:38 <gry>	cluem1nati: what leads you to believe it is a problem with your hardware?
Sep 17 12:45:00 <gry>	cluem1nati: what are the symptoms of damage?
Sep 17 12:45:08 <cluem1nati>	i had it in a nas, and the filesystem is marked as error, tries to run fsck on boot of the nas
Sep 17 12:45:37 <Blondie101010>	did that give errors?
Sep 17 12:45:57 <cluem1nati>	that fsck says you need to run fsck manually with -a or -p, i believe.  when attempting that, it basically brings my nas down, cannot ssh or view web interface
Sep 17 12:46:14 <Blondie101010>	ok, so did you do that?
Sep 17 12:46:30 <Blondie101010>	it confirms there are errors in the FS
Sep 17 12:46:49 <cluem1nati>	Blondie101010: yes, but nas becomes unreachable during the repair
Sep 17 12:47:07 <Blondie101010>	unreachable?
Sep 17 12:47:24 <cluem1nati>	yes, ssh and web interface no longer accept connections
Sep 17 12:47:31 <Blondie101010>	what?
Sep 17 12:47:39 <Blondie101010>	did you run fsck on a mounted drive?
Sep 17 12:47:45 <cluem1nati>	no, unmounted
Sep 17 12:48:13 <cluem1nati>	i currently pulled it from the nas and an trying to ddrescue it using a linux machine
Sep 17 12:48:45 <Blondie101010>	well be careful not to make your situation worse
Sep 17 12:49:32 <Blondie101010>	a defective unmounted hard drive or bad FS should NOT cause the machine to stop responding
Sep 17 12:49:53 <Blondie101010>	that PROBABLY indicates there is a problem that is NOT with the HDD
Sep 17 12:50:15 <cluem1nati>	it would be nice if i can get the data off of it, if i cant, so be it, but im just curious if the drive still can be re-partitioned and used
Sep 17 12:50:34 <Blondie101010>	is that the only HDD in the NAS?
Sep 17 12:50:38 <cluem1nati>	i was able to successfully run an fsck on the other drive in the nas (2-bay), but not with this particular drive
Sep 17 12:50:56 <BCMM>	cluem1nati: SMART overall health self-assessment doesn't mean a lot
Sep 17 12:51:01 <Blondie101010>	how are they set up?
Sep 17 12:51:09 <Blondie101010>	RAID 1?
Sep 17 12:51:11 <cluem1nati>	not raid
Sep 17 12:51:12 <BCMM>	cluem1nati: did you just check that, or did you actually run a self test?
Sep 17 12:51:14 <cluem1nati>	just 2 drives
Sep 17 12:51:37 <cluem1nati>	BCMM: I beleive I did smartclt -a on it, and a short test?
Sep 17 12:52:13 <BCMM>	the other thing to look for is any errors in dmesg when trying to read the drive
Sep 17 12:52:46 <cluem1nati>	BCMM: yes, i did look at that, there was a handful or error, i recall the last was an I/O error of somekind
Sep 17 12:53:08 <Blondie101010>	that could be an indicator of a HDD fault
Sep 17 12:53:11 <BCMM>	cluem1nati: that's a kind of vague description, but it kind of sounds like there is a hardware problem. can you pastebin the dmesg output?
Sep 17 12:53:29 <cluem1nati>	also, there were times the partitions would not show up in fdisk or lsblk
Sep 17 12:53:55 <BCMM>	(if it is a hardware problem, try a new SATA cable before deciding to just throw away the drive - it's surprising how often it's just a loose connection)
Sep 17 12:54:26 <cluem1nati>	upon reboot and re-plugging the drive in (unmounted), i am able to see the partitions at the moment, so then i kicked off a ddrescue
Sep 17 12:55:10 <cluem1nati>	BCMM: let me see if I have anything in dmesg at the moment, I may not since the partitions were visible
Sep 17 12:56:57 <cluem1nati>	https://pastebin.com/7rBvDNJC
Sep 17 12:58:27 <Blondie101010>	like he said, check the physical connection and if it doesn't make a difference, you do have a hardware issue
Sep 17 12:58:47 <Blondie101010>	cluem1nati:  have you had ANY errors with the other drive?
Sep 17 12:59:56 <cluem1nati>	yes, but they were able to take an fsck automatic repair without issue
Sep 17 13:00:00 <BCMM>	cluem1nati: yeah, those errors do not look good at all
Sep 17 13:00:19 <BCMM>	cluem1nati: fsck is not the answer to errors like that! wrong level!
Sep 17 13:00:22 <cluem1nati>	heres the current status of ddrescue: https://pastebin.com/N1HD01DK
Sep 17 13:00:33 <BCMM>	any attempt to write to the drive (including fsck) will make things worse
Sep 17 13:01:11 <BCMM>	if you have ATA errors, you should image as much of the drive as possible with ddrescue, and then consider running fsck on the image if necessary
Sep 17 13:01:19 <cluem1nati>	what alerted me to the issue was my nas would re-mount the main partition as ro
Sep 17 13:01:40 <BCMM>	... because the developers are aware that writing to a compromised medium is a bad idea
Sep 17 13:01:49 <cluem1nati>	BCMM: that's my plan
Sep 17 13:02:40 <Blondie101010>	ok well you now know that the drive is at fault
Sep 17 13:03:34 <cluem1nati>	so from my dmesg, does it look like bad filesystem or failing drive?
Sep 17 13:03:56 <Blondie101010>	you have read errors in your ddrescue that is run on another computer, right?
Sep 17 13:04:30 <cluem1nati>	yes, the drive was moved out of the nas to run ddrescue
Sep 17 13:05:01 <Blondie101010>	ddrescue doesn't even look at the FS, so it is hardware
Sep 17 13:06:50 <cluem1nati>	so i got myself a failing drive based on everything ive shared?
Sep 17 13:07:14 <gry>	what about your smart test?
Sep 17 13:07:23 <gry>	it should tell you that it is fail
Sep 17 13:08:01 <cluem1nati>	gry: am i safe to kick off a short test while ddrescue is running?
Sep 17 13:09:02 <Blondie101010>	cluem1nati:  it seems so, but I'm still annoyed by the freezes that you experienced while the drive was unmounted....  that is abnormal
Sep 17 13:09:30 <cluem1nati>	Blondie101010: my nas is kind of old and low-powered, its dns-321 with alt-f firmware
Sep 17 13:10:47 <cluem1nati>	when ever i run fsck, cpu gets maxed out, load avg is very high, and i think it's just too much for it... so thats why i moved it to a desktop machine to try and perform fsck/ddrescue on it
Sep 17 13:11:11 <Blondie101010>	ahhh
Sep 17 13:11:21 <Blondie101010>	yeah that makes sense
Sep 17 13:14:24 <cluem1nati>	here is output of smartctl -a, https://pastebin.com/Cx4tt6Nk
Sep 17 13:22:22 <Triffid_Hunter>	ionice -c 3 works wonders on tasks with high I/O.. I've no idea why that's necessary in this day and age though
Sep 17 13:23:12 <_ev>	[mysql] how can I drop a user by pattern match? I messed up the input of a username (overtired). I'd like to "drop user test*";
Sep 17 13:23:13 <_ev>	?
Sep 17 13:34:10 <kerframil>	you can't. you'll have to delete directly from mysql.user if you want that (carefully).
Sep 17 13:37:33 <cluem1nati>	Blondie101010, BCMM, gry: thanks for your time

Sep 17 13:38:58 <alpha-carinae>	do gtk programs break qt ones? or does something like installing gnome alongside kde breaks stuff?
Sep 17 13:39:17 <alpha-carinae>	i installed gnome and spectacle now looks like a gtk2 program :O
Sep 17 13:40:22 <BluesKaj>	Hi all
Sep 17 13:41:20 <BCMM>	alpha-carinae: are you logged in to a gnome session at the moment? it's probably just changed your Qt theme
Sep 17 13:41:29 <alpha-carinae>	nope am in kde
Sep 17 13:41:38 <alpha-carinae>	also i uninstalled gnome
Sep 17 13:41:49 <alpha-carinae>	something like this happened before too
Sep 17 13:41:51 <BCMM>	alpha-carinae: it is just spectacle? other Qt applications look the same?
Sep 17 13:42:10 <alpha-carinae>	so far i can only see spectacle being affected, though im mostly curious why this happens
Sep 17 13:42:12 <_ev>	Thank you kerframil
Sep 17 13:46:48 <evilscrew>	any takers
Sep 17 13:54:00 <triceratux>	well i got rosa r11 to go into vesa mode. i had to replace sddm with the lxdm from their repo. but its lxdm 0.4.1 which takes 100% processor because of a bug noticed in 2012 https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1097722-start-0.html
Sep 17 13:55:13 <triceratux>	so i had to patch it with the version from Fedora 30, leaving the Rosa R11 configs of course which are set up for pam. R11 was released 6mo ago & still has a 7 year old bug in the repo. standard linux
Sep 17 13:56:23 <mgolisch>	evilscrew: it complains about that cdrom repo
Sep 17 13:56:25 <mgolisch>	remove it

Sep 17 13:57:20 <julius_>	is there no way to have a command show up in crontab over multiple lines?
Sep 17 13:57:41 <evilscrew>	mgolisch strange. im not even running a cd rom
Sep 17 13:57:49 <evilscrew>	just running linux off a live usb stick
Sep 17 13:57:55 <evilscrew>	perhaps thats the issue?
Sep 17 13:58:03 <mgolisch>	oh maybe it has something to do with that
Sep 17 13:59:32 <evilscrew>	what a pain in the hmm
Sep 17 14:02:20 <_abc_>	Hello. Suggest a command line program which converts a graphical X11 clipboard selection (which I can see in Kclipboard) into a jpg or png file.
Sep 17 14:09:33 <xochilpili>	hello everyone
Sep 17 14:09:40 <xochilpili>	im trying to do something like this: cat my_sample | grep $(cat another | awk -F ":" '{print $2}') | awk -F ":" '{print $1}', directly from shell, but i cant ?
Sep 17 14:10:03 <xochilpili>	how can i grep (from a result of a cat | awk ) ?
Sep 17 14:11:18 <pantsu>	xochilpili: you can replace all that with just awk
Sep 17 14:12:07 <pantsu>	or better, don't use shellscript to begin with
Sep 17 14:12:14 <pantsu>	what are you actually trying to parse?
Sep 17 14:13:30 <xochilpili>	pantsu, i want to parse results from file_one file depending of cat file_two
Sep 17 14:16:17 <BCMM>	_abc_: hmm, imagemagick has a clipboard: special format, but for some reason it's windows-only...
Sep 17 14:21:02 <_abc_>	BCMM: I noticed. Also, this does not work in my distro https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145131/copy-image-from-clipboard-to-file
Sep 17 14:21:21 <_abc_>	xclip says -o -t TARGETS (!) is not available when the only selection is an image
Sep 17 14:22:10 <BCMM>	_abc_: oh, neat. that *is* pretty cryptic!
Sep 17 14:22:31 <_abc_>	BCMM: also I have the old non working version of xclip, trying to upgrade, not in my mainstream

Sep 17 14:32:09 <evilscrew>	is it a bad idea to create a live usb using rufus ?
Sep 17 14:32:53 <triceratux>	evilscrew: nope thats the preferred way. but you have to dig for the dd mode
Sep 17 14:32:53 <pantsu>	evilscrew: depends on how you use in and which version
Sep 17 14:33:01 <pantsu>	make sure to use dd mode

Sep 17 14:33:23 <kur1j>	I'm trying to debug an issue where writes to a kerberized NFS server stops and never returns on "larger" files. For example I've never seen a 10MB file not complete. A 5gb will almost always exhibit this issue.  I did an strace on the client, and on the files NFS locks up on it gets down to "close(1" and then just stops and never returns.
Sep 17 14:33:25 <evilscrew>	oh.... maybe thats what ive been doing wrong

Sep 17 14:38:04 <pantsu>	evilscrew: you have to download it

Sep 17 14:51:25 <evilscrew>	why is DD mode so important
Sep 17 14:52:13 <triceratux>	because isohybrid is an unconscionable kludge
Sep 17 14:54:55 <braindead_>	hey peeps
Sep 17 14:55:26 <braindead_>	i couldnt update my ubunt version because "update-manager-core" wasnt installed on the system
Sep 17 14:55:40 <braindead_>	no it is and i can do-release-upgrade
Sep 17 14:56:18 <braindead_>	my provider told me that "the kernel can not be modified" and i am not exactly sure what that means
Sep 17 14:57:40 <BCMM>	evilscrew: "dd mode" just means writing the image without modifying it
Sep 17 14:58:01 <BCMM>	evilscrew: by default, rufus will try to do some weird hackery to automatically convert CD images for USB boot
Sep 17 14:58:05 <g0tcha>	is dd better than rsync?
Sep 17 14:58:11 <TJ->	braindead_: presumably you're talking about a VPS. It sounds like one of 2 things 1) something based on virtuozzo/containers where there are multiple containers all sharing the same kernel, or a Xen or KVM hypervisor where the kernel is loaded by the host hypervisor, rather than 'booting' via boot-loader inside the VPS
Sep 17 14:58:12 <evilscrew>	gotchya
Sep 17 14:58:53 <mgolisch>	braindead_: its probably a container
Sep 17 14:58:53 <BCMM>	evilscrew: which a) often goes wrong and breaks everything and b) isn't even necessary any more because every major distro's ISOs support USB boot natively
Sep 17 14:59:18 <evilscrew>	BCMM: was having some grief before trying to boot up linux thats why
Sep 17 14:59:19 <evilscrew>	from my usb
Sep 17 14:59:26 <BCMM>	g0tcha: dd and rsync are for different jobs
Sep 17 14:59:28 <evilscrew>	I can send through the error message if it helps.
Sep 17 15:00:31 <BCMM>	evilscrew: on linux, i'd just use dd. on windows, i would recommend win32diskimager or etcher, because they will just copy the image without trying to be clever
Sep 17 15:00:46 <evilscrew>	lol
Sep 17 15:00:49 <evilscrew>	okay ill give this 1 more shot
Sep 17 15:01:06 <evilscrew>	if no working then i will try win32diskimager
Sep 17 15:01:34 <braindead_>	yes it is a vps TJ- and its virtualized via virtuozzo so you nailed it. thanks mgolisch as well
Sep 17 15:02:08 <g0tcha>	BCMM, to run daily backup to a remote server?
Sep 17 15:02:15 <g0tcha>	dd or rsync?
Sep 17 15:02:32 <BCMM>	g0tcha: how would you even use rsync for that? directly on the block device?
Sep 17 15:02:44 <jim>	evilscrew, did you ever try any of the nm interfaces?
Sep 17 15:02:48 <BCMM>	g0tcha: you don't want a block-level copy of a mounted filesystem. use rsync.
Sep 17 15:03:10 <TJ->	g0tcha: depends on what you're backing up... database? neither will help, use the db's own tools else you risk the backup being inconsistent
Sep 17 15:03:47 <TJ->	g0tcha: snapshots of a file-system are another option as long as you ensure any critical files are closed for the snapshot so they're consistent
Sep 17 15:05:07 <evilscrew>	BCMM yep - this error comes up when i try to boot https://imgur.com/A0Pixch
Sep 17 15:05:35 <BCMM>	evilscrew: is that a USB stick that was written by rufus in its default mode?
Sep 17 15:05:40 <evilscrew>	correct
Sep 17 15:05:44 <g0tcha>	TJ-, BCMM to run daily backup of a VM that runs LAMP
Sep 17 15:06:11 <TJ->	g0tcha: so you need to take special care of the database
Sep 17 15:06:26 <BCMM>	g0tcha: it's a VM? you can probably just use the snapshotting feature in whatever VM software you use.
Sep 17 15:06:37 <braindead_>	right now this vps is running on Linux 3.12.0-042stable140.1 .. as far as i can see this is quite old. is there any major disadvantage on not updating the kernel for a webserver
Sep 17 15:06:48 <sudomann>	Oh man, I am surprised to see people on r/programming defending Stallman. Are programmers really like this
Sep 17 15:07:04 <g0tcha>	TJ-, so i can run rsync for everything back run seperate backup for mysql?
Sep 17 15:07:11 <g0tcha>	BCMM, tried that once and it bit me in the ass
Sep 17 15:07:33 <BCMM>	braindead_: that does seem a bit questionable. the major disadvantage would be lack of security support!
Sep 17 15:07:34 <_d0t>	hey guys! I have this weird problem. I have a microsd card with a gpt partition table. The problem is linux doesn't create device nodes for partitions.
Sep 17 15:07:39 <TJ->	braindead_: one would hope the hosting co are updating that kernel for security issues, but there's no way to know unless they also publish the source repository they build from
Sep 17 15:07:54 <_d0t>	there is no error in dmesg, and cfdisk sees the partitions just fine
Sep 17 15:08:02 <_d0t>	i'm also able to access the partitions in windows
Sep 17 15:08:09 <TJ->	_d0t: udev rules preventing it?
Sep 17 15:08:11 <tds>	what kind of vps is this? keep in mind you may be seeing the host's kernel if it's eg openvz, and you won't be able to upgrade yourself
Sep 17 15:08:18 <BCMM>	braindead_: the only current longterm support branch for kernel 3.x is 3.16
Sep 17 15:08:18 <_d0t>	TJ-: how do I check that?
Sep 17 15:08:27 <TJ->	_d0t: what does the device present as? /dev/sd<something> ?
Sep 17 15:08:33 <_d0t>	 /dev/sdb
Sep 17 15:08:58 <BCMM>	braindead_: but it's possible that somebody other than upstream kernel devs is backporting security fixes for the kernel. do you know what distro it's running?
Sep 17 15:09:02 <tds>	if you're on a modern distro with systemd, the otuput of `systemd-detect-virt` may be interesting
Sep 17 15:09:05 <TJ->	_d0t: is the gpt module loaded?
Sep 17 15:09:07 <braindead_>	thanks BCMM and TJ- ..
Sep 17 15:09:08 <evilscrew>	actually win32 imager does not have a persistence partition option, i might try etcher then
Sep 17 15:09:26 <_d0t>	TJ-: i suppose it's compiled in. I have GPT on my main drive here and it works fine.
Sep 17 15:09:28 <braindead_>	BCMM its ubuntu 12.4 right now but i am in the process of updating to 14 or 16
Sep 17 15:09:45 <BCMM>	evilscrew: oh, if you specifically want a tool that's going to make modifications to the image, etcher won't do that either
Sep 17 15:09:53 <tds>	braindead_: 14 is also out of support, you want to go to at least 16
Sep 17 15:10:07 <TJ->	_d0t: hmmm, weird then... I'd have said 'udev rules' but the kernel should handle the partition detection internally
Sep 17 15:10:23 <TJ->	_d0t: can you show us the excerpt from the kernel log from when the device is plugged in?
Sep 17 15:10:31 <tds>	braindead_: but definitely worth checking what kind of virtualisation it's using, new versions of ubuntu may fail to boot under openvz/similar
Sep 17 15:10:51 <braindead_>	its using virtuozzo
Sep 17 15:10:51 <_d0t>	TJ-: https://bpaste.net/show/1EYf
Sep 17 15:10:57 <mgolisch>	maybe just switch to a provider with vm based vps?
Sep 17 15:11:08 <_d0t>	TJ-: it's a usb card reader / usb hub / everything
Sep 17 15:11:19 <braindead_>	right tds i was wrong. its on 14 and i want to update it to 16 or 18..
Sep 17 15:13:03 <TJ->	_d0t: weird ... try this whilst plugging it in again: "udevadm monitor -kpu"
Sep 17 15:13:42 <evilscrew>	nah fukit, ill use unebootin
Sep 17 15:13:58 <tds>	braindead_: 18.04 will definitely fail to work with some ovz kernels, unsure about yours in particular, but worth keeping in mind
Sep 17 15:14:30 <braindead_>	tds, i am running a backup right now since i have basically no idea what i am doing :)
Sep 17 15:14:38 <_d0t>	TJ-: there's quite a lot of stuff
Sep 17 15:14:42 <braindead_>	lets see what happens when i do-release-upgrade
Sep 17 15:14:44 <_d0t>	what am I looking for?
Sep 17 15:15:57 <_d0t>	TJ-: https://pastebin.com/9HnzDZ7k
Sep 17 15:17:27 <triceratux>	evilscrew: under no circumstances use unetbootin
Sep 17 15:25:33 <jim>	evilscrew, at least don't use unetbootin on anything debian derived... it's possible the problems unetbootin creates could affect other dists as well
Sep 17 15:28:31 <jim>	_d0t, I think he means, run the monitor, then plug in the device and unplug it several times to see what the monitor says
Sep 17 15:40:23 <_ev>	Am I correct that KVM shares memory by default? KVM utilizes RAM by request, and not not have dedicated RAM; correct?
Sep 17 15:48:28 <evilscrew>	jim 23:25:34
Sep 17 15:48:31 <evilscrew>	yeh didnt work
Sep 17 15:48:35 <evilscrew>	finally someone actually responds
Sep 17 15:48:54 <cxc99>	could i use a samba share for a linux home directory?
Sep 17 15:49:30 <kepler>	don't see why not
Sep 17 15:50:06 <kerframil>	_ev: memory is not necessarily shared. kernel samepage merging (KSM) can may be enabled for such. yes, host memory is allocated upon request rather than being pre-touched, so to speak.
Sep 17 15:50:27 <section1>	well nfs i think is better for that and more easy to setup.
Sep 17 15:50:35 <Thuryn>	cxc99, you CAN, sure.
Sep 17 15:51:06 <Thuryn>	there are several ways to do that, and as section1 says, NFS might be better (the biggest reason being proper unix permissions handling)
Sep 17 15:51:28 <jim>	evilscrew, ok, one sec, I need to take care of something
Sep 17 15:59:53 <surfaceflinger>	Should I be using numad on numa hardware?
Sep 17 16:02:34 <codeahol1c>	surfaceflinger: you don't have to use it but it may improve performance
Sep 17 16:04:03 <surfaceflinger>	ok
Sep 17 16:04:22 <surfaceflinger>	codeahol1c: what can I use in addition for better performance?
Sep 17 16:06:11 <codeahol1c>	surfaceflinger: i don't understand your question
Sep 17 16:07:07 <evilscrew>	jim forgot about me?

Sep 17 16:11:48 <krumelmonster>	laptop has no ping but (correctly?) tries to route "8.8.8.8 via 192.168.42.1 dev enp0s25 src 192.168.42.230 uid 1000"
Sep 17 16:11:48 <krumelmonster>	https://paste.linux.community/view/a8d496f2
Sep 17 16:12:53 <TJ->	krumelmonster: is the server configured to forward ?
Sep 17 16:13:21 <krumelmonster>	yes: sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
Sep 17 16:13:22 <krumelmonster>	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
Sep 17 16:15:33 <krumelmonster>	Laptop can ping server on 192.168.1.33 but cannot ping other hosts in 192.168.1.x
Sep 17 16:17:56 <section1>	krumelmonster,  can you provide the output of: iptables -L -v -n
Sep 17 16:19:08 <krumelmonster>	but also seem to be routed correctly: "192.168.1.2 via 192.168.42.1 dev enp0s25 src 192.168.42.230 uid 1000". section1: https://paste.linux.community/view/3beeb53b
Sep 17 16:19:31 <tds>	krumelmonster: does 192.168.1.2 have a route for the 192.168.42 network back via your router?
Sep 17 16:20:30 <krumelmonster>	I don't believe so, 192.168.42 didn't exist until now
Sep 17 16:21:12 <evilscrew>	my live linux usb with persistence simply wont boot
Sep 17 16:21:34 <krumelmonster>	tds: also, wouldn't that mean I'd have the same problem on the server itself? I do have perfect internet on the server
Sep 17 16:21:45 <krumelmonster>	evilscrew: how did you create it?
Sep 17 16:21:57 <tds>	I'd expect the server to make outbound connections from its 192.168.1.33 address
Sep 17 16:22:00 <evilscrew>	yumi but i also tried rufus
Sep 17 16:22:10 <tds>	in fact you can see that in the "src" bit of the output you pasted
Sep 17 16:22:12 <section1>	krumelmonster, your gw have to know how traffic packages to 192.168.42 network
Sep 17 16:22:48 <section1>	Kumool,
Sep 17 16:22:49 <section1>	ops
Sep 17 16:23:26 <section1>	krumelmonster, if you don't want to touch the gw ... you can masquerade all packages with src ip .1.33
Sep 17 16:23:53 <tds>	but please don't, there's no good reason to NAT between bits of rfc1918 space like that
Sep 17 16:23:57 <evilscrew>	my live linux usb with persistence simply wont boot
Sep 17 16:24:35 <section1>	i think its a temporal setup..just guessing
Sep 17 16:24:43 <krumelmonster>	evilscrew: Can you $ cat /sys/block/sdX/removable
Sep 17 16:24:43 <krumelmonster>	where sdX is your usb drive?
Sep 17 16:25:31 <evilscrew>	whats the windows equivalent of that command
Sep 17 16:26:13 <triceratux>	evilscrew: have you tried antix or puppy or one of the distros that specifically supports & documents a live persistence architecture for flashdrives ?
Sep 17 16:26:27 <evilscrew>	incorrect
Sep 17 16:26:32 <evilscrew>	im just trying ubuntu regular now
Sep 17 16:27:21 <krumelmonster>	section1, tds I'm kind of new to all this. Could you explain to me or show me some information on why I'd have to touch the gw (192.168.1.2) at all?
Sep 17 16:27:28 <TJ->	krumelmonster: if the hosts in 192.168.1.0/24 don't use 192.168.1.33 as their default gateway, but are using 192.168.1.2 on a different host, they'll try to route 192.168.42.0/24 out the default route when replying, not back "via 192.168.1.33" because they do not have a specific route for 192.168.42.0/24, so the gateway 192.168.1.2 would need to do it for them, as in "ip route add 192.168.42.0/24 via
Sep 17 16:27:30 <TJ->	192.168.1.33"
Sep 17 16:28:41 <triceratux>	ah ubuntu wont cooperate with any 3rd party persistence schemes like unetbootin. the iso has to be dd copied to bootable media so it can be run & the installer invoked. at that point you can do a conventional install with a 2nd flashdrive as target
Sep 17 16:28:43 <section1>	krumelmonster,  there is your answer
Sep 17 16:28:59 <krumelmonster>	Thanks alot, TJ-
Sep 17 16:30:23 <krumelmonster>	evilscrew: That command checks whether the drive registers itself as removable (as supposed to). Soe usb drives pretend to be permanent storage and I never got one of those to boot (although apparently it's posible to flip that bit, I'm not sure)
Sep 17 16:31:04 <krumelmonster>	evilscrew: If your usb drive isn't listed as "removable" in windows, I recommend you try a different one.
Sep 17 16:31:20 <__angelo>	is systemd-udevd service processing /etc/udev/rules.d stuff ?
Sep 17 16:31:32 <TJ->	Ubuntu live will work with persistence if it finds a file-system with the label "casper-rw" on the device
Sep 17 16:34:23 <marslander>	can i safely change the 'label' of my linux prtition in gparted?
Sep 17 16:34:42 <marslander>	i have dual booted mint 19 and win10
Sep 17 16:35:00 <peetaur2>	marslander: if your fstab or other things are using UUID or some other unaffected method, sure...and if it's using label, then update the label
Sep 17 16:35:01 <krumelmonster>	marslander: probably but why would you?
Sep 17 16:35:44 <marslander>	krumelmonster: because windows partition has a label by default but linux doesn't
Sep 17 16:35:56 <marslander>	linux is feeling legt out :(
Sep 17 16:36:00 <marslander>	*left
Sep 17 16:36:28 <marslander>	actually i'm just curious
Sep 17 16:36:54 <krumelmonster>	section1, tds, TJ- the problem is, I don't even know where the router is physically located, let alone have any password for it so I'd NAT. Any recommendation on what tools to use, what manpage to read what to google for that?
Sep 17 16:37:16 <tds>	iptables / nft
Sep 17 16:38:32 <tds>	something like `iptables -t NAT -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.42.0/24 -o enp0s25 -j MASQUERADE` probably
Sep 17 16:40:04 <krumelmonster>	I think I should buy a book on these kinds of things
Sep 17 16:40:31 <tds>	there's plenty of reading material linked in the topic of #Netfilter :)
Sep 17 16:46:53 <jim>	evilscrew, I'm not sure how to solve the problem. other than try to get as much info on it onto the channel where someone who CAN help might go, "oh, I know that one"
Sep 17 16:49:04 <triceratux>	evilscrew: have you looked on the web ? theres thousands of reports of folks getting linux to boot from flashdrives. its not supposed to be impossible. it only seems that way
Sep 17 16:50:07 <jim>	oh, I even had the problem wrong... I thought it had to do with his wireless
Sep 17 16:50:22 <Soo_Slow>	does anybody know how to check if your graphical tablet works on linux? I mean - cinnamon's settings menu recognize it, aswell as 'xsetwacom list devices' and gimp's input settings menu, but I cant draw a thing in gimp or krita. Should I perform extra steps via terminal to make it work properly? Or what?
Sep 17 16:51:08 <jim>	Soo_Slow, is it a wacom?
Sep 17 16:51:14 <Soo_Slow>	jim, yeah
Sep 17 16:51:33 <jim>	which one?
Sep 17 16:52:48 <Soo_Slow>	jim, wacom one m. I've updated my kernel to 4.19 to make it recognize it, since it didnt work on 4.4 and libwacom's github says that this model require at least 4.16
Sep 17 16:56:38 <palate>	How would I bring the `g_ether` module into my system? Should it be enough to enable CONFIG_USB_ETH from menuconfig and recompile the kernel?
Sep 17 16:58:36 <mgolisch>	no idea but that doesnt sound right
Sep 17 16:59:01 <TJ->	palate:  in source tree see drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/Kconfig
Sep 17 16:59:11 <mgolisch>	ah actualy thats realy the usb gadget ethernet thing
Sep 17 16:59:15 <mgolisch>	maybe thats it then
Sep 17 16:59:35 <Soo_Slow>	jim, like - on youtube, people connect their tablets and they "just work" out of box - you move cursor instead of mouse, all that. But in my case - nothing happens.Not in paining software, nor outside of it
Sep 17 17:00:22 <TJ->	palate:  in fact this is better: grep g_eth drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/Makefile
Sep 17 17:00:33 <palate>	TJ-: Kconfig?
Sep 17 17:01:03 <TJ->	palate: Kconfig files contain the kernel config options that control what the associated Makefile builds
Sep 17 17:01:28 <TJ->	palate: wqhen you use menuconfig it is presenting the combined contents of all Kconfig files
Sep 17 17:01:33 <palate>	TJ-: I have u_ether.c, u_gether.h, u_ether_configfs.h, u_ether.h, ether.c in drivers/usb/gadget
Sep 17 17:01:46 <palate>	TJ-: ether.c being the only one in "legacy"
Sep 17 17:02:01 <TJ->	palate: what kernel release is that?
Sep 17 17:02:08 <TJ->	palate: "head Makefile"
Sep 17 17:02:54 <palate>	TJ-: I'm in i586-poky-linux/linux-libc-headers/5.0-r0/linux-5.0
Sep 17 17:03:01 <palate>	TJ-: (yocto)
Sep 17 17:04:02 <TJ->	palate: so 5.0 ... I see g_ether mentioned in the files I gave you
Sep 17 17:04:39 <palate>	TJ-: checking again
Sep 17 17:06:39 <palate>	TJ-: oh... could it be that `ether.c` becomes `g_ether`? Inside of drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/ether.c, that says ".name = g_ether" somewhere.
Sep 17 17:07:10 <palate>	TJ-: also Kconfig says for `config USB_ETH`: "Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a dynamically linked module called "g_ether"."
Sep 17 17:08:03 <palate>	TJ-: and the Makefile says "obj-$(CONFIG_USB_ETH)       += g_ether.o". I guess that's it
Sep 17 17:09:52 <triceratux>	zomg https://lwn.net/Articles/799375/rss
Sep 17 17:09:53 <palate>	TJ-: oh, and the manifest shows kernel-module-g-ether-4.19.44 (I was looking for "g_ether", but here it's g-ether -_-)
Sep 17 17:11:26 <TJ->	palate: that is because the Makefile aliases g_ether-y := ether.o so it'll move  ether.o to g_ether.o
Sep 17 17:12:00 <palate>	TJ-: got it. So reading the makefile is sometimes better than reading the Kconfig :)
Sep 17 17:12:12 <TJ->	palate: read both in conjunction :)
Sep 17 17:12:20 <TJ->	Kconfig controls what the Makefile does
Sep 17 17:14:25 <jim>	conjunction junction, what's that function?
Sep 17 17:14:42 <palate>	TJ-: right. And what about dependencies between options? I used menuconfig to go check CONFIG_USB_ETH, and then when building, I got warning about other options that could not be set. I assumed for now that this means that even though I enabled the gadget mode, some options are somehow not available on my platform
Sep 17 17:15:06 <fromBeyond>	hi. I am getting an error, when attempting to compile something, that "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXt.so" is missing a rule to make target
Sep 17 17:15:09 <palate>	TJ-: my point is: as long as I configure with menuconfig, I should be fine, right? Unless I check something that is not compatible with my board
Sep 17 17:15:28 <fromBeyond>	if i try to install libxt, it says i have it already
Sep 17 17:16:20 <oo_miguel>	what filesystem should I choose for my NAS? and what is the recommended way to provision the space to other machines (I suppose something like mounting via sshfs will produce a lot of overhead) ?
Sep 17 17:16:49 <oo_miguel>	... I also wonder how it will deal with synchronizing in case I mount it on two machines?
Sep 17 17:20:06 <Wulf>	oo_miguel: How about LVM and let other machines use block devices e.g. through nbd?
Sep 17 17:20:56 <oo_miguel>	Wulf: willthis result in the least overhead but I won't be able to mount it on 2 devices right?
Sep 17 17:21:16 <Wulf>	oo_miguel: yeah, can mount it only once
Sep 17 17:21:25 <Wulf>	oo_miguel: perhaps drbd instead of nbd. But same thing.
Sep 17 17:21:46 <oo_miguel>	I will think about this. thanks for the suggestion
Sep 17 17:21:56 <Wulf>	oo_miguel: if you want shared storage, I'd go for an object storage like aws s3.
Sep 17 17:22:04 <Wulf>	(I dislike NFS)
Sep 17 17:22:58 <oo_miguel>	you mean like running my own ceph or something?
Sep 17 17:23:20 <Wulf>	don't know what ceph is, but yes.
Sep 17 17:23:35 <triceratux>	http://techrights.org/2019/09/17/rms-witch-hunt/ "I do not think Stallman stepped down for a good reason this week."
Sep 17 17:23:38 <hans_>	what is ssh?
Sep 17 17:23:49 <Soo_Slow>	jim, everything works now - I've just had to unplug my mouse (so tablet was the first connected device) and restart laptop :D
Sep 17 17:23:53 <oo_miguel>	Wulf: ok thanks
Sep 17 17:24:08 <fromBeyond>	Just to report back. I simply linked the libXt.so.6 to the libXt.so, which was missing
Sep 17 17:24:10 <fromBeyond>	and now it works
Sep 17 17:24:20 <jasondockers>	Does anyone know how to install / modify OpenSSL to include the "AES-256-GCM" cipher? I need it to connect to a VPN
Sep 17 17:24:22 <Soo_Slow>	hans_, secure shell. Its to connect other computers via internet or lan
Sep 17 17:24:44 <Soo_Slow>	*other computer's terminal
Sep 17 17:24:48 <triceratux>	just too much http://hckrnews.com/
Sep 17 17:25:40 <TJ->	palate: Yes, use menuconfig and it'll deal with dependencies. My point was to use Kconfig/Makefile to identify *which* option controls build of a module, in your case g_ether
Sep 17 17:25:40 <Wulf>	jasondockers: install a reasonably recent OS.
Sep 17 17:26:15 <TJ->	jasondockers: is that in openssl 1.1.1c ?
Sep 17 17:26:42 <Wulf>	I used that cipher recently on one of my machines
Sep 17 17:26:43 <Soo_Slow>	well, Im on arch and 'openssl help' doesnt list aes-256-gcm either. Is it THAT new or something?
Sep 17 17:27:23 <palate>	TJ-: sure, thanks!
Sep 17 17:28:05 <Wulf>	Soo_Slow: openssl ciphers
Sep 17 17:28:58 <Soo_Slow>	Wulf, oh, I see. Thanks
Sep 17 17:31:20 <jasondockers>	@TJ-, it's openssl 1.0.2g
Sep 17 17:32:07 <jasondockers>	TJ, I could try finding the appropriate package for 1.1.x, but by default apt is installing 1.0.2g
Sep 17 17:32:20 <hans_>	jasondockers, git clone -b 'OpenSSL_1_1_1c' --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/openssl/openssl; cd openssl; ./config no-shared enable-ssl2 enable-ssl3 enable-ssl3-method ; make -j $(nproc);
Sep 17 17:34:01 <hans_>	jasondockers, not sure exactly which one of them does it, but when doing `./openssl ciphers -v | grep -i aes | grep -i 256 | grep -i gcm | pastebinit` afterwards, i get https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/sxBMTNdETgzAAHlHvkGRwA/raw?password=DZbpXVlSLMBYvpJEvlws
Sep 17 17:35:19 <akk>	Anyone gotten adb (as in talking to an android device) working recently? I had it working on older debian machines but can't seem to get it on current ubuntu.
Sep 17 17:35:20 <TJ->	jasondockers: See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man1/openssl-enc.html and the sentence "The enc program does not support authenticated encryption modes like CCM and GCM. The utility does not store or retrieve the authentication tag."
Sep 17 17:36:02 <jasondockers>	TJ :@
Sep 17 17:36:05 <jasondockers>	crap
Sep 17 17:36:27 <jasondockers>	I'm currently compiling 1.1.0 for probably no reason
Sep 17 17:36:51 <TJ->	jasondockers: apparently the libressl fork of openssl (may) do it
Sep 17 17:37:30 <jim>	Soo_Slow, oh, great :) (still, it seems to me a problem if you have to connect in a certain order... they should fix that if they can)
Sep 17 17:37:32 <jasondockers>	TJ-, yeah that works for me on osx..
Sep 17 17:37:44 <justsomeguy>	akk: Adb works fine. Did you forget to enable usb debugging on your android device, maybe?
Sep 17 17:37:57 <jasondockers>	I'll try to see if libressl is available on ubuntu
Sep 17 17:38:03 <jim>	evilscrew, how things going?
Sep 17 17:38:15 <evilscrew>	sorry guys went afk for a bit
Sep 17 17:38:17 <evilscrew>	was hungry lol
Sep 17 17:38:21 <Soo_Slow>	jim, well, my mouse gets recognized as both mouse and gamepad, so... stuff happens :D
Sep 17 17:38:27 <jasondockers>	I hate encryption
Sep 17 17:38:28 <evilscrew>	gonna try this now but with virtual box. too much of a headache doing live usb
Sep 17 17:38:31 <akk>	justsomeguy: The phone itself is fine, it can talk to several other linux machines no problem.
Sep 17 17:38:47 <akk>	justsomeguy: It's the ubuntu side that isn't seeing any devices.
Sep 17 17:38:51 <TJ->	jasondockers: it's not in Ubuntu
Sep 17 17:39:04 <jasondockers>	TJ-, well I'll try to compile it then?
Sep 17 17:39:06 <hans_>	"AES-256-GCM" is on the cipher list after compiling it like i showed above.
Sep 17 17:39:07 <justsomeguy>	akk: What does 'adb devices -l' say?
Sep 17 17:39:09 <akk>	I've tried adb as root, I've tried adding my own udev rule file, neither one helped.
Sep 17 17:39:39 <akk>	justsomeguy: "List of devices attached" and then a blank line.
Sep 17 17:39:50 <TJ->	akk: does the user running adb have permissions to access the raw device? does "sudo adb devices" also not show the device? Does it show up in "lsusb" with the correct (ADB) Vendor:Product ID?
Sep 17 17:40:38 <akk>	TJ-: sudo doesn't help.
Sep 17 17:40:56 <akk>	And it does show up in lsusb and in dmesg.
Sep 17 17:41:15 <justsomeguy>	akk: Also is adb.service enabled and started?
Sep 17 17:41:45 <akk>	justsomeguy: No, I've always had adb just start the service the first time it's run, which is what it's doing now.
Sep 17 17:41:51 <jim>	evilscrew, debian has a thing for making live images, works pretty good; I made two example images and booted them... I want to make one that has X, an xterm (or something), borg backup, gparted and the ability to connect to the net and install more packages
Sep 17 17:42:00 <justsomeguy>	akk: Ok, that should work, too.
Sep 17 17:42:25 <jim>	I forget what it's called... but first, would you be insterested in something like that?
Sep 17 17:42:25 <akk>	I didn't install android-tools-adbd because I don't want it running all the time, just when I need it.
Sep 17 17:42:43 <TJ->	akk: and the Vendor:Product in lsusb is being matched by your udev rule and your rule is being triggered for sure?
Sep 17 17:43:47 <akk>	TJ-: I think the Vendor:Product isn't actually in /lib/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules, which is why I tried making a rule for that specific device
Sep 17 17:44:00 <akk>	(galaxy S5, weird that it wouldn't already be in there)
Sep 17 17:44:11 <akk>	Let me double-check that ...
Sep 17 17:45:15 <TJ->	akk: that's what I thought you'd done, which is correct, but you need to verify your rule is being triggered. You can do that by adding a tell-tale to it of the form RUN+="/bin/touch /tmp/adb_rule"  then when you connect the device check if /tmp/adb_rule has been created
Sep 17 17:45:17 <akk>	Right. This device isn't in /lib/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules but it is in 69-libmtp.rules
Sep 17 17:45:47 <TJ->	akk: OK, but MTP doesn't tag it like 51-android does I don't think
Sep 17 17:45:51 <akk>	and if I add my own rule as 50-galaxy.rules with a SYMLINK so I can see whether it's created, it's created with group audio
Sep 17 17:45:57 <braindead_>	is anybody of you guys using a remote server instead a local installation for some tasks? like open a session to a server and doing stuff there because there is a benefit like faster internet, more power, stability or anything?
Sep 17 17:46:21 <evilscrew>	jim i had no problems whatsoever creating a regular live usb ... the only issue however, came up when i wanted a persitence partition
Sep 17 17:46:21 <akk>	but if I name my rule 99-galaxy.rules, then it creates the device with group plugdev (which is what my rule says to do)
Sep 17 17:46:28 <evilscrew>	i ran into a world of problems and never actually got it working in the end
Sep 17 17:46:30 <akk>	not that it matters since it doesn't work as root either.
Sep 17 17:46:33 <TJ->	akk:  so you generally would create a custom rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/51-galaxy.rules that matches on the device ID and does the same thing as 50-galaxy does
Sep 17 17:47:10 <jim>	hmm
Sep 17 17:47:10 <akk>	My rule says: SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04e8", ATTR{idProduct}=="6860", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev", SYMLINK+="android%n"
Sep 17 17:47:42 <TJ->	akk: any rule in /etc/udev/rules.d/ with the same name as a system rule in /lib/udev/rules.d/ will totally replace the original rule set... that may be causing issues for you
Sep 17 17:47:53 <evilscrew>	and now, i have a stomach ache 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sep 17 17:47:59 <jim>	akk, the mode alows any user on the system to read and write that device
Sep 17 17:48:51 <akk>	jim: I can always adjust the permissions later once I get it working ... first I need to get adb to see it.
Sep 17 17:49:58 <jasondockers>	I built and installed the latest version of openssl but it looks like openvpn (which is what I need to use the latest version of openssl) statically linked openssl :(((((
Sep 17 17:50:11 <jasondockers>	So I'll need to build openvpn now
Sep 17 17:50:43 <akk>	TJ-: Do you think it might help to comment that device out of the mtp rule?
Sep 17 17:51:01 <jim>	jasondockers, what dist is that?
Sep 17 17:52:19 <TJ->	akk: depends on what the MTP rule is doing... that should only trigger if you put the device in MTP mode. Usually the device keeps adb debugging separate from the storage/charging mode
Sep 17 17:53:20 <vimar>	Hello everybody
Sep 17 17:53:22 <vimar>	;-)
Sep 17 17:53:29 <akk>	I tried commenting it out; my /dev/android3 device still gets created, group plugdev, but adb devices -l as root still sees nothing.
Sep 17 17:53:51 <kur1j>	TJ-: Not sure if you remember my NFS issue but I've done a decent amount of packet traces and from the client I see all of the WRITE() packets and then when it successfully completes I'll see a COMMIT and a reply for the COMMIT and then a CLOSE and a reply from the server to CLOSE, on unsuccessful writes where the client never finishes I see
Sep 17 17:53:51 <kur1j>	WRITE..., COMMIT and then a COMMIT packet from the server but then I never see CLOSE packet calls.
Sep 17 17:53:54 <Soo_Slow>	vimar, hello there
Sep 17 17:54:03 <akk>	The device is in MTP mode, because there's no adb-only mode.
Sep 17 17:54:45 <akk>	I wish I could figure out what adb -devices is looking for.
Sep 17 17:54:47 <vimar>	Hi Soo_Slow , how are you today?
Sep 17 17:54:53 <TJ->	kur1j: so client fails to send a CLOSE ?
Sep 17 17:55:05 <kur1j>	TJ-: thats what it appears to be
Sep 17 17:55:11 <kur1j>	but I don't see why it wouldn't
Sep 17 17:55:12 <akk>	BTW I'm doing pkill adb before each test, to make sure the daemon gets restarted.
Sep 17 17:55:24 <Soo_Slow>	vimar, Im fine, thanks
Sep 17 17:55:29 <kur1j>	if I turn off kerberos it works without issue
Sep 17 17:55:58 <kur1j>	the other interesting thing that I found is that if I restart the NFS server the client will renegotiate and will finish
Sep 17 17:56:40 <TJ->	kur1j: could the kerberos ticket(s) be expiring?
Sep 17 17:57:05 <akk>	Googling for debug adb is unproductive (since adb is supposedly for android debugging, debugging adb itself is hard to google for).
Sep 17 17:57:22 <mgolisch>	but you enabled adb?
Sep 17 17:57:42 <kur1j>	TJ-: thats what I thought, but I have no idea on how to check. I've involved Dell support at this point and they are making me jump through their normal hoops
Sep 17 17:57:44 <mgolisch>	its usualy in the android developer settings menu
Sep 17 17:59:03 <BadBob>	akk:  try searching for "how to debug adb" (in quotes)
Sep 17 17:59:55 <TJ->	akk: when attaching the device to another PC that does see it via adb, does it have the same USB ID as it shows on this problem system?
Sep 17 18:00:17 <Dagmar>	akk: It's looking for devices running a compatible versionof ADB, in the places it's been configured to think they'll be.  _Usually_ this means the USB bus, but some people are crazy enough to set up a TCP connection and if so it'll look for whatever of that they've set up as well
Sep 17 18:00:42 <kur1j>	TJ-: https://imgur.com/a/ZTSgem9
Sep 17 18:00:43 <mgolisch>	like you enabled usb debugging in the devloper settings?
Sep 17 18:00:46 <Dagmar>	You should be doing what TJ- says.
Sep 17 18:00:52 <mgolisch>	pretty sure it will not show up in adb devices otherwise
Sep 17 18:01:08 <Dagmar>	There zero point in attempting to "debug" adb until you've actually performed the steps necessary to set it up normally
Sep 17 18:01:47 <kur1j>	TJ-: you can see at the top where it will WRITE, then COMMIT, and then just wait...with the SEQUENCE packets, once I restart the server...it picks up the session again, and commits again, and closes
Sep 17 18:02:44 <brool>	how do i type a special character in a termianl? e.g. U+03BB
Sep 17 18:03:00 <dieggsy>	is there any  up-to-date way to have a read/wite compressed filesystem or directory, (without changing my entire system's filesystem from ext4)? I remember something about a compressed fuse filesystem but AFAICT it was unmaintained. squashfs is read-only IIRC
Sep 17 18:03:12 <dieggsy>	s/wite/write
Sep 17 18:03:19 <akk>	TJ-: Yes, same vendor:product id on a system where it works.
Sep 17 18:03:30 <Dagmar>	You're not getting an efficient _malleable_ compressed filesystem
Sep 17 18:04:08 <akk>	Dagmar: I'm wondering how it looks for usb devices, though, since it has a compatible one here and isn't finding it, so it's looking for something this system isn't providing.
Sep 17 18:04:26 <jim>	dieggsy, the typical way, is to mount a compressed filesystem on the dir you want for that
Sep 17 18:05:02 <dieggsy>	Dagmar: define malleable?
Sep 17 18:06:05 <akk>	In my fiddling around on the working machine, though, now it no longer works there either. I wonder if connecting to the new machine could have made the phone disable debugging on its end.
Sep 17 18:06:28 *	akk boots a third machine that definitely used to work and hasn't been fiddled with
Sep 17 18:06:44 <dieggsy>	jim: i can't just mount any arbitrary compressed filesystem that isn't on a disk on a directory right? like, without having a btrfs disk, i can't just have a btrfs dir, can i?
Sep 17 18:06:49 <Dagmar>	dieggsy: He clearly wants to be able to write to the mounted filesystem
Sep 17 18:06:56 <dieggsy>	......i have yet a lot to learn about filesystems regardless
Sep 17 18:07:06 <Dagmar>	This is more a matter of the nature of compression
Sep 17 18:07:09 <TJ->	akk: I've just tested here with an Android device and it offers THREE different USB IDs depending on the combination of ADB/MTP on/off
Sep 17 18:07:36 <dieggsy>	Dagmar: right.
Sep 17 18:07:56 <Dagmar>	Compression doesn't have utterly predictable results, so if you change just one byte in a file it will likely result in everything past that point needing to be recompressed, which means rewritten, and the length may not be the same
Sep 17 18:07:59 <akk>	aha -- I  think talking to ubuntu has caused the phone to switch off adb. It doesn't work on this machine either.
Sep 17 18:08:16 <Dagmar>	There are ways to solve some of those problems, but not all of them at once
Sep 17 18:08:24 *	akk swears at google making android so hard to talk to
Sep 17 18:08:47 <Dagmar>	Most of those problems result in things which many people would consider mild- to severe-misbehaviours
Sep 17 18:09:02 <Dagmar>	akk; It's not hard.
Sep 17 18:09:53 <Dagmar>	You enable developer settings.  You enable ADB.  You connect to a USB host running ADB.  You then authorize that specific device as being allowed to talk to ADB at all
Sep 17 18:10:11 <Dagmar>	If you've any business mucking about with ADB, then these are not hard things to do
Sep 17 18:10:34 <Dagmar>	...because for sure, everything you might do _within_ or _through_ ADB is more complex and carries more risk of damage to your device.
Sep 17 18:10:37 <TheJestr>	windows had windows stacker 3, surely linux has a disk compression :D
Sep 17 18:10:50 <Dagmar>	We tend to not use things that suck
Sep 17 18:10:59 <akk>	That was it. Apparently trying to connect from ubuntu before installing the special udev rule caused the phone to switch off usb debugging altogether.
Sep 17 18:11:04 <Dagmar>	The standards are just lower for Windows is all
Sep 17 18:11:09 <TheJestr>	that was abck in the 9s
Sep 17 18:11:11 <TheJestr>	90s
Sep 17 18:11:28 <evilscrew>	is it even possible in the first place to get something like pi hole running from a live linux usb
Sep 17 18:11:29 <brool>	how do i type special characters in a terminal like U+03BB for example? i used to know how to do it, it was like ctrl+something and then the combo
Sep 17 18:11:32 <brool>	but i have completely forgotten
Sep 17 18:11:47 <Dagmar>	evilscrew: Lots of things are possible
Sep 17 18:12:22 <akk>	Dagmar: Sure, you go through those steps, then it randomly gets unset and you have to go through them again
Sep 17 18:12:35 <Dagmar>	It doesn't "randomly" get unset
Sep 17 18:12:47 <Dagmar>	...and you're talking to a guy who's pushed literally dozens of releases to the Play Store
Sep 17 18:13:07 <akk>	Okay, it's totally predictable that trying to connect from one machine would disable access from all the machines I've been using for years.
Sep 17 18:13:14 <akk>	(to you, I guess. I don't find that predictable)
Sep 17 18:13:22 <Dagmar>	It just appears to be random to you because you didn't yet know what you were doing
Sep 17 18:13:41 <brool>	~ it's magic ~
Sep 17 18:13:59 <Dagmar>	No, it's just complex, and not every device behaves the same
Sep 17 18:14:19 <brool>	that's exactly what a wizard would say
Sep 17 18:14:26 <Dagmar>	...but that's on the manufacturers.  Usually devices behave just one of two ways with respect to ADB itself
Sep 17 18:14:52 <akk>	Anyway, talking to android has gotten worse every time I've "up"graded to a new android. I miss the days when I could just use usb-storage
Sep 17 18:14:58 <akk>	and use rsync to keep directories in sync.
Sep 17 18:15:19 <Dagmar>	Realistically it shouyld only require the device to present one set of prod/vend codes for ADB access, but ya might note there's just dozens of them in the udev ruleset that's been created over time
Sep 17 18:15:21 <akk>	Now, I have this elaborate script that basically emulates rsync over adb.
Sep 17 18:15:36 <Dagmar>	USB storage was _never_ working correctly, nor would it ever _be able_ to work correctly.
Sep 17 18:15:50 <akk>	I do understand some of the challenges they had with usb storage
Sep 17 18:15:55 <Dagmar>	USB storage _requires_ the host that's mounting have exclusive access to it
Sep 17 18:16:34 <Dagmar>	Just like, even though you can do this if you take two machines with a SCSI controller in them, connect them BOTH TOGETHER via a SCSI cable, and have just one drive connected there, they can both access it...
Sep 17 18:16:35 <akk>	but I still think they could have been fixed. For instance, lock it so that indeed, the device has exclusive access while it's connected.
Sep 17 18:16:41 <justsomeguy>	akk: I run sshd with termux for that, sometimes. It's less finicky than connecting via adb.
Sep 17 18:16:43 <Dagmar>	...but doing so at the same time ends in tears...
Sep 17 18:17:15 <Dagmar>	akk: That would mean that the phone would have to deal with the block storage being summarily yanked out from under it without warning
Sep 17 18:17:20 <akk>	justsomeguy: I installed an ssh app but because of sandboxing, it can't write to other apps' storage areas.
Sep 17 18:17:28 <akk>	(sshd)
Sep 17 18:18:13 <Dagmar>	There's also the matter that having _any_ unrestricted contexts available to the user will violate Android's security model and cause SafetyNet checks to fail
Sep 17 18:18:24 <Dagmar>	I just always booted into TWRP if I needed a shell.  Much easier.
Sep 17 18:18:33 <rcf>	For devices with removable storage it worked fine.
Sep 17 18:18:45 <Dagmar>	rcf: What devices were those?
Sep 17 18:18:54 <akk>	I tried to install twrp once but gave up, it's hideously complicated on verizon samsungs.
Sep 17 18:19:03 <rcf>	They already needed the ability to deal with arbitrary removal of an SD card.
Sep 17 18:19:08 <akk>	(and doesn't work on most of them, as far as I could tell)
Sep 17 18:19:23 <justsomeguy>	Argh!
Sep 17 18:19:41 <Dagmar>	rcf: Those guys got lucky.  Hotplugging writeable media is always going to be iffy.
Sep 17 18:20:18 <Dagmar>	Think about what happens if you yank a card out while it's being written to and you'll understand why many phones have their microSD card slot buried under the battery
Sep 17 18:20:26 <rcf>	Dagmar: not if you have a sensible eject mechanism.
Sep 17 18:20:26 <akk>	I'd be happy with a setup that worked as long as you don't disconnect or unplug the card.
Sep 17 18:20:45 <Dagmar>	rcf: Of you have a "soft" eject mechanism
Sep 17 18:20:52 <akk>	I'm willing to agree not to do those things, to get better functionality without needing to implement my own rsync protocol.
Sep 17 18:20:54 <Dagmar>	If the user can just yank the card out, nothing will protect that
Sep 17 18:21:16 <rcf>	Nothing will, but the soft eject will always work with USB mass storage.
Sep 17 18:22:29 <rcf>	Unless the operating system is fundamentally unable to sequence becoming a mass storage device and unmounting a file system, in which case it is just horrible written and not worth using.
Sep 17 18:24:52 <evilscrew>	meh fuck this
Sep 17 18:25:54 <rcf>	If your argument held any water we would not be able to do things like pass through USB devives to a virtual machine. Of course we can. There are mechanisms to safely stop using the resource on one operating system to make it available to another.
Sep 17 18:29:42 <KillerWasp>	hello
Sep 17 18:30:58 <jim>	KillerWasp, hi
Sep 17 18:31:57 <akk>	Right, I don't see what's so special about usb-storage relative to all the other methods of filesystem sharing.
Sep 17 18:32:02 <Gustavo6046>	I wonder if it is possible to replicate a PulseAudio routing architecture on a Windows machine, just out of curiosity.
Sep 17 18:33:01 <rcf>	akk: it requires sharing the underlying block device. That’s it. Entirely doable, but Android devs didn’t care to get it right.
Sep 17 18:33:32 <akk>	I suspect it was more that they wanted to discourage accessing the filesystem and funnel people into using apps more.
Sep 17 18:33:41 <rcf>	That too.
Sep 17 18:34:05 <rcf>	And removable storage has been phased out in most cases as well.
Sep 17 18:34:26 <Gustavo6046>	Android gives you little control, and even Termux can only do so much (because of it). And that's still more freedom than what an iPhone would allow you.
Sep 17 18:34:30 <Dagmar>	No it was not
Sep 17 18:34:36 <Dagmar>	It was literally exactly as I said it was
Sep 17 18:34:37 <akk>	Right. I'm still on marshmallow which has the confusing conflation of two modes for the SD card, one of which turns out not to work on samsungs.
Sep 17 18:34:37 <Gustavo6046>	I'm sure it is possible to install some Android fork which gives you more contr.
Sep 17 18:34:41 <Gustavo6046>	Or even replace it?
Sep 17 18:34:48 <Gustavo6046>	Does Debian work in...uh, nevermind.
Sep 17 18:35:25 <akk>	Gustavo6046: For a small number of phone models, yes, there are open source androids (LineageOS) plus actual linux distros. But not for most phones.
Sep 17 18:35:31 <Dagmar>	It was pretty much always broken to allow any kind of storage that had a filesystem acecssible by the device to be exported as USB storage
Sep 17 18:35:35 <Dagmar>	_Always_
Sep 17 18:35:43 <xochilpili>	hello everyone
Sep 17 18:35:53 <Dagmar>	All they did between releases of Android was triage that shifted the insanity around
Sep 17 18:35:54 <akk>	(too much of phone hardware is proprietary, so getting all the drivers working is a lot of work)
Sep 17 18:36:02 <xochilpili>	i have an hydra question, does anyone here know about it?
Sep 17 18:36:05 <twainwek>	too lazy to try it for myself, but what happens if someone changes their computer date to an earlier date and pushes a commit to a git repo?
Sep 17 18:36:15 <Dagmar>	THe problem still remains that there's almost no block device filesystem that will tolerate _two_ hosts modifying it at the same time
Sep 17 18:36:30 <Dagmar>	This is the underlying problem that was the reason USB mass storage never worked out well
Sep 17 18:36:44 <rcf>	Dagmar: Which is solved 100% by just... unmounting the file system.
Sep 17 18:36:45 <xochilpili>	im trying to make a test using hydra and https-post-form but i always got 400 bad request, using curl im able to get valid response, but no idea what am i missing
Sep 17 18:36:49 <Dagmar>	It is the reason people now use MTP, which is ugly and more like FTP than I wanna think about, but it works safely
Sep 17 18:36:49 <akk>	twainwek: My guess (I'm too lazy too) is that commits will show up as the earlier date, though the push will probably show the server's date.
Sep 17 18:37:12 <Dagmar>	rcf; That's like saying eating an skyscraper is just a matter of chewing and swallowing
Sep 17 18:37:32 <akk>	I never got either of the two mtpfs options working well enough on linux that I could rsync to them.
Sep 17 18:37:41 <rcf>	Dagmar: if Android can’t handle unmounting a filesystem, it is fundamentally too broken to be worth using.
Sep 17 18:37:47 <Dagmar>	Go ahead and unmount some arbitrary filesystem from your desktop _while it's in use_.
Sep 17 18:37:48 <Dagmar>	See what happens.
Sep 17 18:37:52 <Gustavo6046>	How would I make a virtual storage device (like a .img or .iso file containing a Debian netinst image, for example) available and bootable in the phone, from the computer, via a USB cable?
Sep 17 18:37:55 <Dagmar>	Android is Linux, dude
Sep 17 18:38:07 <Dagmar>	You might wanna watch where you're pointing that accusy-finger
Sep 17 18:38:11 <rcf>	And my Linux system handles this just fine.
Sep 17 18:38:16 <Dagmar>	This is a problem _Linux_ doesn't solve well
Sep 17 18:38:23 <Dagmar>	No, it absolutely does not
Sep 17 18:38:35 <akk>	Unmounting a busy filesystem, no, not so much.
Sep 17 18:38:39 <Dagmar>	Your desktop will have a _fit_ if you arbitrarily yank a filesystem out
Sep 17 18:38:39 <xochilpili>	anyone ?
Sep 17 18:39:03 <rcf>	You don’t arbitrarily yank it out, you stop any application accessing it first.
Sep 17 18:39:07 <BCMM>	rcf: that's pretty much what android used to do (unmount the filesystem and give exclusive, block-level access to the PC). they changed it quite some time ago because they don't want to give up their own access
Sep 17 18:39:12 <akk>	OTOH, android is very happy to kill apps at any time, so it could just kill any app that has an open file on the removable storage.
Sep 17 18:39:42 <akk>	("The following app would be killed: osmand. Do you still want to mount this filesystem?")
Sep 17 18:39:59 <akk>	That doesn't seem like it would be hard at all.
Sep 17 18:40:20 <akk>	Basically do the equivalent of lsof.
Sep 17 18:40:46 <rcf>	It isn’t. If it were, my use of SD cards and USB storage on Linux would be impossible feats.
Sep 17 18:41:00 <akk>	Then if any new apps try to access the filesystem, deny it as long as the remote computer still has it mounted.
Sep 17 18:46:06 <ne2k>	 weird problem. I was running openvpn as nobody:nogroup, but needed to extend it to learn-address into dnsmasq hosts file and sighup dnsmasq. I created a user openvpn and run openvpn as openvpn:nogroup, then run script under sudo from openvpn. script runs fine, but the line where it does kill -HUP fails with permission denied when run by openvpn. but it works fine if I do sudo -u openvpn -g nogroup sudo /path/to/learn-address
Sep 17 18:46:06 <ne2k>	.sh params...
Sep 17 18:46:43 <ne2k>	the only difference I can see in the sudo logs is the PWD (which I can't see making a difference as I've used absolute paths for everything) and whether TTY=something real (interactive; working) and TTY=unknown (from openvpn, not working). any clues?
Sep 17 18:56:41 <KillerWasp>	Gustavo6046, with 'cdrtools' package...
Sep 17 18:58:37 <KillerWasp>	Gustavo6046, maybe you want a gui like brasero...
Sep 17 19:00:41 <Gustavo6046>	Ah, yeah, almost forgot about that. Thank you!
Sep 17 19:01:13 <KillerWasp>	Gustavo6046, is better if you download any livecd in internet... :/
Sep 17 19:03:52 <faceface>	My freenas used to email me when there were root logins or updates and stuff. Is there a simple daemon to do that?
Sep 17 19:04:26 <TheScoop>	faceface: logcheck maybe?
Sep 17 19:05:05 <faceface>	TheScoop: ty
Sep 17 19:05:27 <TheScoop>	yw :)
Sep 17 19:09:57 <Dagmar>	It's cute how people think they're going to solve in a few minutes a problem that has taken years of realtime before actual experst just called it a broken idea and walked away from it
Sep 17 19:10:25 <Dagmar>	But feel free to keep thinking there's some super-simple way to make USB mass storage work for everyone
Sep 17 19:11:01 <akik>	what's broken with it?
Sep 17 19:11:14 <KillerWasp>	Dagmar, what?...
Sep 17 19:11:18 <Dagmar>	Having Android killing apps that might be accessing the filesystem would have _hilarious_ results
Sep 17 19:11:47 <Dagmar>	That will go over especially well with people using Photos
Sep 17 19:11:51 <akik>	android moved away from usb storage
Sep 17 19:12:13 <Dagmar>	Specifically, they stopped supporting the USB mass storage protocol
Sep 17 19:12:25 <Dagmar>	It can't be used in the way people want to use it, and this isn't something that will change.
Sep 17 19:12:27 <Dagmar>	Use MTP.
Sep 17 19:12:40 <KillerWasp>	Android not is Linux...
Sep 17 19:12:41 <Dagmar>	It wasn't something that should have happened in the first place
Sep 17 19:12:45 <akik>	people are just lazy so mtp
Sep 17 19:14:44 <akik>	Dagmar: what's the problem with usb mass storage you mentioned?
Sep 17 19:15:10 <KillerWasp>	Dagmar, #android
Sep 17 19:15:31 <akik>	KillerWasp: android is linux
Sep 17 19:15:38 <KillerWasp>	akik, no.
Sep 17 19:15:40 <prussian>	shared filesystems is always nightmare fuel
Sep 17 19:15:58 <KillerWasp>	akik, It has ceased to be since it was manipulated and closed.
Sep 17 19:16:12 <akik>	well it includes linux
Sep 17 19:17:02 <prussian>	specific fork of linux that mostly stays in sync.
Sep 17 19:18:07 <jim>	there needs to be a fork of the linux kernel that does not have anything microsoft wrote, because they're suing companies on that basis
Sep 17 19:18:08 <KillerWasp>	akik, a altered linux maybe?...
Sep 17 19:18:23 <drkshadow>	Filesystem question: how can I test a piece of hardware to see if it supports write barriers?
Sep 17 19:18:33 <KillerWasp>	but not have any real related with linux now...
Sep 17 19:18:58 <KillerWasp>	jim, what??? really???
Sep 17 19:19:05 <akik>	KillerWasp: don't know what you mean with altered but it's running the linux kernel
Sep 17 19:19:33 <jim>	well I keep hearing that
Sep 17 19:19:37 <akik>	all distros run somehow altered kernel
Sep 17 19:19:58 <KillerWasp>	akik, I download the Linux kernel and modify it so thoroughly to my liking and then I put Trojans in order to control the machines of anyone who uses it, would it still be Linux?
Sep 17 19:20:07 <jim>	oh... and one more little thing... richard stallman just resigned from fsf
Sep 17 19:20:14 <prussian>	sad
Sep 17 19:20:30 <akik>	uname -s
Sep 17 19:20:34 <KillerWasp>	akik, no, it's a broken code of the original linux... :/
Sep 17 19:21:07 <rcf>	That is the normal distribution strategy, minus the trojans. Still Linux.
Sep 17 19:21:12 <prussian>	i doubt many are running straight from kernel.org linux's
Sep 17 19:21:24 <triceratux>	oh nooooes hope he talked to ghislaine maxwell first. she can get him a job saving the sharks
Sep 17 19:21:27 <KillerWasp>	where you download something and change it, it's a broken code, not have a Guarantee that it works like the original...
Sep 17 19:21:55 <p8m>	Torvalds has the Linux trademark so it's up to him :P
Sep 17 19:22:01 <akik>	KillerWasp: install "terminal emulator for android", start it, "uname -s"
Sep 17 19:22:26 <KillerWasp>	akik, unknown, i no use android emulator...
Sep 17 19:22:34 <akik>	don't close your eyes :)
Sep 17 19:22:37 <faceface>	I have sendmail, but it isn't runnign as a service.. I'm trying to follow a tutorial on how to use sendmail to send mail via google
Sep 17 19:22:49 <faceface>	I remember doing this once in teh past and I had to set up gpg IIRC
Sep 17 19:22:55 <KillerWasp>	akik, said me you...
Sep 17 19:23:43 <faceface>	apt install sendmail seems to want to do stuff, but I have the sendmail utility... I wonder what provided it
Sep 17 19:24:05 <faceface>	ah, postfix
Sep 17 19:24:19 <faceface>	OK, postfix is running
Sep 17 19:25:25 <faceface>	https://support.plesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004947113-How-to-set-up-Postfix-to-send-emails-using-Gmail-Relay-with-authentication- < seems reasonable
Sep 17 19:26:36 <biam>	does anyone know of a way to show file handles that have been deleted but remain open? is this something lsof or sysctl fs could show?
Sep 17 19:26:47 <rcf>	Dagmar: it requires some trade-offs, but it's not impossible any more than removable storage on normal systems. Though I'm sure you also think USB flash drives were a mistake....
Sep 17 19:26:48 <KillerWasp>	As soon as Torvalds resign also, I'm going to take responsibility for the kernel, they can trust me. :)
Sep 17 19:34:38 <djhworld>	i'm doing an operating systems course in my spare time at the moment to try and get a better understanding of things, and one thing in the course that has struck out to me is the process IPC mechanisms. i mean I knew about unix sockets, but I didn't know message queues and shared memory exists
Sep 17 19:34:41 <djhworld>	this thing is
Sep 17 19:34:44 <KillerWasp>	10 min of silence from my comment... it's ugly... :(
Sep 17 19:34:46 <djhworld>	I've never seen this in the wild
Sep 17 19:35:06 <djhworld>	does anyone have any example apps or systems that make use of message queues/shared memory?
Sep 17 19:35:28 <djhworld>	or are unix sockets generally the 'accepted' way and the other types are out of fashion?
Sep 17 19:35:48 <KillerWasp>	djhworld, the X11 work with queues...
Sep 17 19:35:59 <djhworld>	ok well, that's definitely a big one :D
Sep 17 19:37:23 <KillerWasp>	I don't know a program that uses shared memory, there are only forks using PIPEs between processes...
Sep 17 19:37:58 <akik>	djhworld: ipcs -m shows those
Sep 17 19:38:35 <djhworld>	ah yeah, yeah been playing with it recently.
Sep 17 19:39:20 <kerframil>	postgresql uses sysv ipc
Sep 17 19:39:46 <kerframil>	albeit not message queues, iirc
Sep 17 19:39:54 <djhworld>	kerframil: for shared memory?
Sep 17 19:39:59 <kerframil>	djhworld: I believe so
Sep 17 19:40:02 <djhworld>	nice
Sep 17 19:40:05 <djhworld>	thanks
Sep 17 19:40:08 <KillerWasp>	akik, nice, thanks.
Sep 17 19:40:47 <kerframil>	mono is another. no idea how it is used there.
Sep 17 19:42:00 <KillerWasp>	gthumb, hexchat, and pcmanfm have shared memory...
Sep 17 19:42:06 <KillerWasp>	seem...
Sep 17 19:42:28 <KillerWasp>	and medit...
Sep 17 19:43:42 <KillerWasp>	ok, all apps with X11 use... :/
Sep 17 19:51:47 <Soo_Slow>	vlc question. Is it possible to setup it, so maximum volume will never go above 100%? (coz by default peak is 200%)
Sep 17 19:54:11 <triceratux>	https://www.oschina.net/news/109926/rms-resigns
Sep 17 19:54:12 <koala_man>	Soo_Slow: I googled it and one site says "Tools > Preferences > Show settings = all (bottom left corner) In the dropdown menu on the left select: Interface > main interfaces > Qt (on the right, scroll down to "Maximum Volume displayed" and change to 100.)"
Sep 17 19:55:01 <Rebelian02>	Hello
Sep 17 19:55:22 <akik>	Soo_Slow: do you mean it increases the volume set in pulseaudio?
Sep 17 19:55:59 <KillerWasp>	mmmm...
Sep 17 19:56:15 <Rebelian02>	ks
Sep 17 19:56:16 <Rebelian02>	ks
Sep 17 19:56:20 <KillerWasp>	No one here ever tried alsamixer?...
Sep 17 19:56:35 <KillerWasp>	:/
Sep 17 19:57:07 <koala_man>	I use it
Sep 17 19:58:25 <KillerWasp>	"I googled it and one site says..." not seem...
Sep 17 19:58:29 <Soo_Slow>	koala_man, its still possible to go above 100 via mouse wheel or keyboard shortcuts tho. But thanks
Sep 17 19:58:43 <Soo_Slow>	akik, no, its own volume
Sep 17 19:58:44 <koala_man>	KillerWasp: I think you're misreading something. that was VLC
Sep 17 19:58:52 <akik>	plasma 5 limits the volume but i can increase it with: pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 150%
Sep 17 19:59:03 <akik>	pulseaudio is in use
Sep 17 19:59:26 <KillerWasp>	koala_man, well, I'm sure he has tried with VLC and the desktop environment, so I think it should be much further back...
Sep 17 19:59:57 <becool>	tom delonge from blink-182 is getting divorced https://people.com/music/tom-delonge-files-for-divorce-after-18-years-of-marriage/
Sep 17 20:01:00 <koala_man>	KillerWasp: have you used VLC?
Sep 17 20:01:06 <Samizdat>	That's the second time in a week I've heard Blink 182 mentioned.  New band?
Sep 17 20:01:08 <Soo_Slow>	becool, bad for him
Sep 17 20:01:23 <KillerWasp>	koala_man, no, i hate vlc...
Sep 17 20:01:24 <becool>	Soo_Slow: that's what i was thinking. she's gonna take him to the cleaners
Sep 17 20:01:33 <Soo_Slow>	Samizdat, lmao
Sep 17 20:01:33 <Soo_Slow>	its very old band
Sep 17 20:01:37 <koala_man>	KillerWasp: it shows
Sep 17 20:01:42 <becool>	Samizdat: probably because they have a new album in 3 days
Sep 17 20:01:46 <Samizdat>	Alrighty then.
Sep 17 20:02:31 <Soo_Slow>	they were kinda popular in early-mid 2000s
Sep 17 20:03:13 <KillerWasp>	koala_man, I prefer the minimalist and what works best, that's why I use mpv, in the end I control the volume from mpv or alsamixer. Although I also have a speaker in the desktop environment and from the pulseaudio commands (without pavucontrol)...
Sep 17 20:03:15 <Samizdat>	Yeah, nowadays, < 20 years *is* considered old.
Sep 17 20:04:36 <Samizdat>	The Stones still get wheeled out onto gurneys to perform their sets.  *That's* old.
Sep 17 20:04:46 <becool>	lol
Sep 17 20:05:22 <Soo_Slow>	lol
Sep 17 20:05:43 <Soo_Slow>	well, you cant call <20 years old group "a new band" either
Sep 17 20:06:44 <jim>	KillerWasp, in regards to audio, I like to have pulse for youtube, and also jack audio connection kit for things that are jack-aware
Sep 17 20:07:45 <Soo_Slow>	I thought about moving from vlc to mpv tho. But in my distro mpv is built with lots of unnecessary dependencies like smbclient, while vlc remains kinda "just what you need and nothing extra without plugins"
Sep 17 20:08:20 <KillerWasp>	my last experience with jack was horrible, it has destroyed my system and left it very slow...
Sep 17 20:08:58 <section1>	Soo_Slow, try mplayer
Sep 17 20:08:58 <akik>	does vlc do vaapi? i can use mpv --hwdec=vaapi and the cpu usage keeps low
Sep 17 20:09:21 <KillerWasp>	vaape*
Sep 17 20:09:32 <akik>	what's vaape?
Sep 17 20:09:37 <KillerWasp>	the weed...
Sep 17 20:09:44 <section1>	heh
Sep 17 20:09:57 <akik>	i only do alcohol
Sep 17 20:10:29 <jim>	yeah, I had cadence for awhile, but the debian package it's in (I built those packages from the cadence source package) didn't have all the depends together, so an "apt autoremove" killed it
Sep 17 20:10:51 <toothe>	Someone is asking me to ask here if there are any voice-to-text programs for Linux. He might have a disability.
Sep 17 20:11:34 <jim>	and the developers aren't listening to anyone who say they need to improve their packages, so I gave up and now I use them both without cadence
Sep 17 20:11:35 <becool>	more likely to have a typing disability if he's asking for voice2text
Sep 17 20:11:45 <toothe>	Yes, excuse me.
Sep 17 20:12:34 <becool>	toothe: there's kaldi
Sep 17 20:13:26 <section1>	toothe, check this too https://fosspost.org/lists/open-source-speech-recognition-speech-to-text
Sep 17 20:15:09 <KillerWasp>	Kaldi can recognize my voice? Although it sounds disgusting....
Sep 17 20:15:26 <section1>	like a wasp?
Sep 17 20:15:41 <KillerWasp>	section1, yes.
Sep 17 20:15:47 <section1>	:)
Sep 17 20:16:10 <KillerWasp>	bzzzt!
Sep 17 20:16:25 <section1>	lol
Sep 17 20:17:38 <Samizdat>	toothe: also see sphinx.
Sep 17 20:18:21 <toothe>	I conveyed these
Sep 17 20:18:27 <toothe>	Again, this isn't for me, so I have never used either software
Sep 17 20:19:21 <Samizdat>	Although you may need to run sphinx in Wine.  I'm not sure there's a Linux version.
Sep 17 20:24:57 <Samizdat>	I hate to use the G-word, but there's also Googe's speech recognition API https://pythonspot.com/speech-recognition-using-google-speech-api/ .
Sep 17 20:25:25 <KillerWasp>	i also hate google...
Sep 17 20:30:53 <KillerWasp>	"The board will be conducting a search for a new president, beginning immediately. Further details of the search will be published on fsf.org."
Sep 17 20:31:28 <KillerWasp>	too irresponsible on the part of stallman, not having sought his successor before resigning... ¬¬
Sep 17 20:31:46 <Thuryn>	bah
Sep 17 20:31:48 <Thuryn>	nonsense
Sep 17 20:31:56 <KillerWasp>	Thuryn, ?
Sep 17 20:32:11 <roomba>	We would like to welcome KillerWasp. Our new president! KillerWasp for the People! KillerWasp for Freedom!
Sep 17 20:32:13 <KillerWasp>	Thuryn, you hate fsf?...
Sep 17 20:32:13 <Samizdat>	I'm surprised he stuck around long as he did.
Sep 17 20:32:15 <Thuryn>	it doesn't matter if he had a succession plan
Sep 17 20:32:28 <KillerWasp>	roomba, YAAAAAY!!! \o/
Sep 17 20:32:38 <Thuryn>	it's not as though most large organizations are truly lead from that level in the first place
Sep 17 20:32:50 <Thuryn>	they'll be fine
Sep 17 20:33:02 <Samizdat>	Microshaft's purchase of GitHub spells, if not the end, at least a seriously dangerous setback to free software.
Sep 17 20:33:16 <lupine>	lol
Sep 17 20:33:35 <lupine>	if your free software was predicated on the existence of github, you were screwed anyway
Sep 17 20:33:38 <Thuryn>	or possibly a shift in Microsoft's long-term plans toward free software
Sep 17 20:33:52 <Thuryn>	which they've been using anyway
Sep 17 20:34:01 <Samizdat>	A significant chunk of free software lives in, and is dependent upon GitHub.
Sep 17 20:34:12 <roomba>	it's really not though.
Sep 17 20:34:18 <KillerWasp>	Being free does not mean you have to neglect your homework and let it become like a public toilet...
Sep 17 20:34:27 <roomba>	if github went offline today, all of those projects would have new homes tomorrow.
Sep 17 20:34:28 <lupine>	kids these days, I swear
Sep 17 20:34:37 <Samizdat>	And anything dependent on Microshaft, as free software, is doomed.
Sep 17 20:34:41 <lupine>	"how will I survive without my centralized corporate services?"
Sep 17 20:34:52 <koala_man>	roomba: all the actively maintained ones anyways
Sep 17 20:35:11 <Thuryn>	Samizdat, depends on what you mean by "free"
Sep 17 20:35:23 <Thuryn>	"free software" means a lot of different things, depending upon the context
Sep 17 20:35:34 <Thuryn>	MS puts out a lot of things "for free"
Sep 17 20:35:35 <Samizdat>	As Stallman defines it, "Free as in code, and as in free beer."
Sep 17 20:35:41 <Samizdat>	And as in personal freedom.
Sep 17 20:35:44 <Thuryn>	not interested in Stallman
Sep 17 20:35:52 <Thuryn>	"personal freedom" means a lot of different things, too
Sep 17 20:35:55 <Samizdat>	Did you read what I wrote?
Sep 17 20:36:04 <lupine>	absolutely not
Sep 17 20:36:11 <Samizdat>	Now we're picking the fly feces from the pepper.
Sep 17 20:36:13 <KillerWasp>	rm beer for stallman
Sep 17 20:36:14 <Thuryn>	i read what you wrote.  i think you're wrong.
Sep 17 20:36:18 <roomba>	koala_man: yes. and heaven forbid we lose corporate centralization... oh how terrible that would be.
Sep 17 20:36:21 <Thuryn>	as well as vulgar.
Sep 17 20:36:29 <Samizdat>	Waaa.
Sep 17 20:36:48 <KillerWasp>	Samizdat, what happened with feces???
Sep 17 20:36:57 <de-facto>	imho Stallman should be appreciated for his achievements the difference he made rather than for what he is discussed in press right now
Sep 17 20:37:21 <Samizdat>	Let's let it drop (no pun intended) -- Thuryn's delicate sensibilities are wounded.
Sep 17 20:37:44 <Thuryn>	that's right.
Sep 17 20:37:46 <Samizdat>	Stallman should absolutely be appreciated.
Sep 17 20:37:56 <KillerWasp>	Although free software happens like everything else, it needs management or leader...
Sep 17 20:38:11 <roomba>	KillerWasp: that's why we elected you president, silly!
Sep 17 20:38:13 <lupine>	I dunno, he was responsible for the promulgation of freedom 0, an absolutely poisonous and immoral idea
Sep 17 20:38:46 <KillerWasp>	roomba, You are the only one who has chosen me so far, I wait for the rest of the votes. :P
Sep 17 20:39:08 <roomba>	The rest of the votes are on their way. All who voted for KillerWasp, please submit your ballots!
Sep 17 20:39:12 <KillerWasp>	hummm... i hate democracy...
Sep 17 20:39:24 <section1>	haha
Sep 17 20:39:26 <Thuryn>	https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html
Sep 17 20:39:29 <Henry151>	voting is violence
Sep 17 20:39:33 <KillerWasp>	lupine, who?
Sep 17 20:39:35 <Thuryn>	freedom zero seems to be pretty basic to me
Sep 17 20:39:36 <lupine>	rms
Sep 17 20:39:53 <Samizdat>	Henry151: only if you vote Democrat.
Sep 17 20:40:02 <lupine>	Thuryn: it is discarded by most copyfarleft licenses, for nuanced and well-thought-out reasons
Sep 17 20:40:13 <Thuryn>	like what?
Sep 17 20:40:17 <KillerWasp>	lupine, You say it promotes freedom but doesn't really offer it?
Sep 17 20:40:17 <Dagmar>	de-facto: What is being discussed in the press is pretty legally-actionable, IMHO
Sep 17 20:40:32 <lupine>	freedom for some, rather than freedom for all, is superior
Sep 17 20:40:36 <roomba>	when does kernel 5.2.x become LTS and 4.19.x gets "bumped down" a notch?
Sep 17 20:40:37 <lupine>	helping your class enemies is immoral
Sep 17 20:40:51 <Thuryn>	i see a lot of rhetoric, but little substance in here.
Sep 17 20:40:57 <Dagmar>	This is one of those cases where the internet hate brigade needs to STFU
Sep 17 20:41:17 <Samizdat>	Wait -- how is Freedom 0 "poisonous and immoral?"
Sep 17 20:41:24 <Thuryn>	if you have to resort to name-calling, you're probably full of shit.
Sep 17 20:41:42 <Samizdat>	And vulgar.
Sep 17 20:41:51 <lupine>	it's poisonous because it kills the commons. it's immoral because it helps your class enemies
Sep 17 20:41:53 <section1>	5.2 lts?  where do you see that ?
Sep 17 20:41:54 <Thuryn>	and likely vulgar
Sep 17 20:42:00 <lupine>	if you think it's name-calling, you're probably not thinking it through
Sep 17 20:42:04 <Samizdat>	I have no class enemies.
Sep 17 20:42:10 <lupine>	sure you do
Sep 17 20:42:11 <Dagmar>	I suspect what microsoft gets out of running Github is positive press that they sorely need
Sep 17 20:42:23 <KillerWasp>	Please, select your level of freedom:
Sep 17 20:42:23 <KillerWasp>	dictatorship [<------||--------------->] anarchy
Sep 17 20:42:30 <Samizdat>	No, because I reject its Marxian underpinnings.
Sep 17 20:42:32 <Thuryn>	lupine, "copyfarleft" is name-calling, and you have yet to explain how me running a program how i want "helps me class enemies'
Sep 17 20:42:34 <prussian>	freedom isn't free
Sep 17 20:42:35 <lupine>	exactly who they are will depend on your class, of course
Sep 17 20:42:37 <roomba>	section1: it's not LTS yet. I was wondering if there is any indication of when it could be?
Sep 17 20:42:44 <lupine>	Thuryn: no, copyfarleft is how these licenses self-identify
Sep 17 20:42:55 <lupine>	I'm not referring to GPL, that is copyleft and contains freedom 0
Sep 17 20:43:05 <prussian>	what in the god's green earth is a copyfarleft license?
Sep 17 20:43:05 <Samizdat>	I thought Marxism died with Mao?
Sep 17 20:43:08 <hexnewbie>	We absolutely need to get rid of freedom 0, so that licenses can add multiple incompatible use restrictions, until we have enough of them to forbid to you run Linux kernel, GNU libraries and/or X11 on the same computer together, because they all have different, incompatible use restrictions
Sep 17 20:43:20 <Samizdat>	Only place Marxism still lives, is American universities.
Sep 17 20:43:24 <lupine>	https://lynnesbian.space/csl/formatted/ , for example, does not
Sep 17 20:43:25 <Samizdat>	Let it die.
Sep 17 20:43:27 <Thuryn>	copyfarleft:  https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Copyfarleft
Sep 17 20:43:29 <Dagmar>	hexnewbie: How so?
Sep 17 20:43:30 <Thuryn>	TIL this is a thing
Sep 17 20:43:33 <lupine>	Samizdat: class is not a marxist analysis, per se
Sep 17 20:43:37 <neoncortex>	We need a new network, internet will turn into something like a television soon
Sep 17 20:43:39 <lupine>	you have a class, even if you don't want to admit it
Sep 17 20:43:47 <Samizdat>	yawn
Sep 17 20:43:54 <Thuryn>	<lupine> you have a class, even if you don't want to admit it  <-- now THIS is true
Sep 17 20:44:10 <prussian>	jesus fuck
Sep 17 20:44:12 <Thuryn>	and i'll add that most people think they are middle class, but are in fact working class
Sep 17 20:44:18 <Dagmar>	Being allowed to run software as you wish is kind of on the far end from "restrictive"
Sep 17 20:44:19 <Thuryn>	but back to Linux-y stuff
Sep 17 20:44:23 <de-facto>	Dagmar, yeah and it makes me sad to read that most topics in mainstream press about Stallman seem not to be about his main influence that he actually was able to establish
Sep 17 20:44:31 <prussian>	what are you all even arguing about?
Sep 17 20:44:32 <lupine>	if philosophy of software licensing isn't linux-y stuff, what is?
Sep 17 20:44:32 <Thuryn>	i still don't see how freedom 0 is immoral
Sep 17 20:44:44 <lupine>	it compels you to materially aid your class enemies
Sep 17 20:44:46 <lupine>	how can it be moral?
Sep 17 20:44:47 <Thuryn>	social classes is kinda tangent, though
Sep 17 20:44:50 <Samizdat>	prussian: does it occur to you that taking the Lord's name in vain might offend people here?
Sep 17 20:44:58 <Thuryn>	i don't see how it materially aids my class enemies, though
Sep 17 20:45:00 <Thuryn>	that part is still missing
Sep 17 20:45:07 <prussian>	Samizdat: frankly, I don't give a damn
Sep 17 20:45:08 <Samizdat>	(Yes, my delicate sensibilities are righteously wounded).
Sep 17 20:45:09 <Dagmar>	de-facto: yeah I've already caught a couple of people in my FB feed that _clearly_ did not take the time to actually read the emails
Sep 17 20:45:19 <jim>	prussian, please watch your language while you're here
Sep 17 20:45:19 <lupine>	they are permitted to avail themselves of your (and your class's) efforts
Sep 17 20:45:31 <Thuryn>	lupine, interesting.
Sep 17 20:45:35 <lupine>	you are, of course, permitted to reciprocate, but that is an *unequal* exchange
Sep 17 20:45:38 <KillerWasp>	Thuryn, i also want known about of class...
Sep 17 20:45:43 <Dagmar>	Stallman should propbably file a suit against Vice and The Daily Beast, because they definitely made material deviations from fact
Sep 17 20:46:03 <prussian>	lol, defamation. good luck with that.
Sep 17 20:46:07 <hexnewbie>	Dagmar: If we were to allow use restrictions as lupine suggests, and every developer adds their own ones based on their personal philosophy, we'd quickly have a situations where no two pieces of free software could be used together. GPL vs. CDDL on steroids.
Sep 17 20:46:09 <lupine>	if you're bourgois, freedom 0 helps you much more than you're compelled to help others
Sep 17 20:46:12 <roomba>	Dagmar: there's no case. the court of NPC has already adjorned.
Sep 17 20:46:17 <section1>	roomba, ahh ok... but 4.19 eol is 2020 i think
Sep 17 20:46:21 <lupine>	hexnewbie: sure, fracturing of the commons is a concern
Sep 17 20:46:22 <jim>	Samizdat, the 'jesus' part is not part of channel policy, but the next word he said is
Sep 17 20:46:25 <lupine>	but so is *capture* of the commons
Sep 17 20:46:27 <roomba>	section1: oh crap... really? :(
Sep 17 20:46:28 <prussian>	as long as vice and daily beast quoted him clearly and omitted opinion, they didn't do anything wrong.
Sep 17 20:46:28 <section1>	so i think that 5.2 not becoming lts
Sep 17 20:46:32 <Thuryn>	lupine, i would argue, though, that freedom 0 provides greater benefit to people within my class by having it than the elite gain by their added acces
Sep 17 20:46:37 <Samizdat>	I wonder if Stallman's resignation has anything to do with perceived misappropriation of the recent $1 million grant.
Sep 17 20:46:40 <Dagmar>	prussian: They said he defended Epstein.  this is not true.  He defended Minsky, and he was pretty clear on what points
Sep 17 20:46:43 <lupine>	and I think it's very arguable that the GPL and MIT/BSD commons are absolutely captured at this point
Sep 17 20:46:47 <KillerWasp>	lupine, i'm agree with you...
Sep 17 20:46:48 <roomba>	section1: hopefully not early 2020. that would suck. i really don't want to have to get new hardware.
Sep 17 20:46:54 <Thuryn>	in other words, the benefit that the elites gain from freedom 0 is miniscule compared to the benefits reaped by the masses
Sep 17 20:46:55 <Samizdat>	jim: that's unfortunate.
Sep 17 20:47:00 <roomba>	section1: intel wifi in 5.2 is still horribly broken.
Sep 17 20:47:00 <lupine>	this is why we see evern capitalists fighting back against freedom 0 with the wossname clause, etc
Sep 17 20:47:12 <roomba>	been stuck on 4.19.x
Sep 17 20:47:18 <section1>	roomba, i found this  that 5.4 will become lts
Sep 17 20:47:19 <lupine>	we're so thoroughly captured that even the middle-tier capitalists are being destroyed by the big-tier ones
Sep 17 20:47:21 <Dagmar>	prussian: There's a strong argument to be made that those two media outlets are who spun up the hate machine in the first place
Sep 17 20:47:31 <Thuryn>	of course capitalists will fight against freedom 0.  it removes several means of monetizing a thing.
Sep 17 20:47:36 <Dagmar>	...and that directly resulted in harm to Stallman and the FSF
Sep 17 20:47:39 <lupine>	Thuryn: some capitalists are very much *for* it
Sep 17 20:47:45 <lupine>	the largest ones, unsurprisingly
Sep 17 20:48:00 <Dagmar>	"The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose" <-- this does what now?
Sep 17 20:48:00 <lupine>	so what's better: lots of small, partially-overlapping commons that *haven't* been captured, or a few large commons that *have* been captured, in the main?
Sep 17 20:48:19 <jim>	I don't think so; I really don't like organized religion of any kind; their proponents have started wars over religions beliefs, and I'm very definitely against any of that
Sep 17 20:48:24 <Thuryn>	except that freedom 0 is aimed at preventing "capture" in the first place
Sep 17 20:48:32 <Dagmar>	How on earth does it do that?
Sep 17 20:48:36 <lupine>	well, it's not
Sep 17 20:48:49 <Thuryn>	sure it is. "if a tool is made, i can use it for whatever i want."
Sep 17 20:48:55 <lupine>	it's very much aimed at ensuring wide adoption, *including* by those who capture it
Sep 17 20:48:56 <Samizdat>	You'd think quaint terms like "capitalist" would wane in such prosperous times.
Sep 17 20:48:59 <section1>	roomba,  sorry past fail ...found this https://people.kernel.org/gregkh/next-long-term-supported-kernel-release
Sep 17 20:49:02 <lupine>	and yet
Sep 17 20:49:18 <lupine>	we weren't at fully automated luxury gay space communism last I checked
Sep 17 20:49:25 <Samizdat>	No, the more prosperous we are, the louder they howl.
Sep 17 20:49:32 <prussian>	Dagmar: maybe, but the harm would have to be probably linked to those outlets and different states might have different takes on anti-slapp
Sep 17 20:49:35 <lupine>	since capitalists self-identify as such, I don't think it's a controversial term
Sep 17 20:49:38 <roomba>	section1: ahah. thank you. so it seems we're safe for some time.
Sep 17 20:49:57 <section1>	:)
Sep 17 20:50:01 <Samizdat>	I prefer "quaint" to "controversial."
Sep 17 20:50:03 <de-facto>	yet truth, facts or balance in topic weights don't seem to be given their appropriate priorities nowerdays in press anymore and that is not just the case in the "post factum" trump area
Sep 17 20:50:08 <Dagmar>	prussian: A suit would stand on the basis of the statements alone
Sep 17 20:50:22 <prussian>	the libel suit would only draw more negative press, not less anyhow.
Sep 17 20:50:24 <lupine>	people who I assert are capitalists do generally agree with me
Sep 17 20:50:46 <KillerWasp>	i hate capitalism...
Sep 17 20:50:49 <Dagmar>	It might make them think twice before manufacturing outrage for mouseclicks in the future
Sep 17 20:51:14 <Dagmar>	They wouldn't be the first company to have a lawsuit for such behaviour damage them severely
Sep 17 20:51:22 <Thuryn>	capitalism is all well and good, but it's not a panacea.
Sep 17 20:51:25 <Samizdat>	Socialism has worked in every country it's been tried but 179.
Sep 17 20:51:41 <Thuryn>	socialism is all well and good, but it's not a panacea.
Sep 17 20:51:51 <lupine>	who's talking about socialism
Sep 17 20:51:52 <Thuryn>	it's almost as if you can't solve every problem with one tool... ;)
Sep 17 20:51:55 <Dagmar>	Samizdat; It might interest you to know that it's worked out pretty well for hte USA when they've borrowed ideas from it
Sep 17 20:51:57 <lupine>	oh, only you
Sep 17 20:52:02 <KillerWasp>	I don't know what purpose capitalism has, all they do is desperately go milking the Adsenses just to get a few miserable pennies...
Sep 17 20:52:16 <Dagmar>	Don't make the mistake of determining that _any_ "pure" system works
Sep 17 20:52:25 <Thuryn>	^^
Sep 17 20:52:25 <roomba>	KillerWasp: that's not capitalism. that's called google. rofl.
Sep 17 20:52:26 <lupine>	you can almost smell the defensiveness :p
Sep 17 20:52:34 <KillerWasp>	roomba++
Sep 17 20:52:35 <Dagmar>	Capitalism is pretty harmful to a whole lotta people in the way it's being used in the states
Sep 17 20:52:51 <KillerWasp>	sure...
Sep 17 20:52:59 <Thuryn>	Dagmar, that's because it's being used in areas where socialism would work better.
Sep 17 20:53:16 <Dagmar>	Thuryn: precisesly.  "pure" systems pretty much wreck people
Sep 17 20:53:25 <lupine>	one can critique freedom 0 from a solely capitalist point of view, as indeed, many capitalists have done
Sep 17 20:53:35 <lupine>	I wouldn't, due to not being brain-dead, but is is possible
Sep 17 20:53:36 <Dagmar>	Just like a security model, an economic model has to fit the use case
Sep 17 20:54:01 <roomba>	"pure" systems wreck for sure. doesn't matter what system it is.
Sep 17 20:54:15 <Samizdat>	What would a lupine version of the Four Freedoms look like, I morbidly curiously wonder.
Sep 17 20:54:50 <de-facto>	status quo in most mainstream press already seems to have established clickbait on a unacceptable level, so that ppl got used to accepting the unacceptable
Sep 17 20:54:54 <Thuryn>	i don't see a credible problem with freedom 0, though i'm interested to know if there's a case study of where it went wrong somehow.
Sep 17 20:54:59 <Dagmar>	The guy who basically invented insulin had a pretty socialist-friendly view about it, because it keeps people from dying
Sep 17 20:55:16 <Dagmar>	Now capitalism has made a mess of it and it's pretty much prohibitively expensive
Sep 17 20:55:21 <Thuryn>	the fact that there are (supposedly) some big corps that support it is suspicious, but not really evidence of anything.
Sep 17 20:55:48 <Thuryn>	Dagmar, that's a good example.  "What is staying alive worth to you?"
Sep 17 20:56:14 <Dagmar>	A better question is "How much does it really cost to keep people from dying?"
Sep 17 20:56:40 <roomba>	An even better question is "How can we sell more high fructose corn syrup to make moar diabetics?"
Sep 17 20:57:28 <Samizdat>	"Freedom 0: the freedom to take other people's hard-earned wealth -- without guns, of course (we're still working that one out)."
Sep 17 20:57:31 <koala_man>	high fructose corn syrup is so awful, that's why I pay 3x more for agave syrup aka high fructose cactus syrup
Sep 17 20:57:33 <Dagmar>	It's not the corn syrup.  It's the diet people keep
Sep 17 20:57:37 <Thuryn>	Dagmar, that's the proper question.  "How much is your life worth?" is just a demonstration of how that fundamental principle of capitalism brings one very quickly to a morally questionable position with health care.
Sep 17 20:57:42 <lupine>	Samizdat: pretty much, eyah
Sep 17 20:57:52 <roomba>	koala_man: rofl.
Sep 17 20:57:53 <lupine>	freedom 0 boils down to that
Sep 17 20:58:04 <Dagmar>	"Freedom 0" is not a restriction
Sep 17 20:58:15 <Samizdat>	"Freedom 1:nthe freedom to distribute that wealth equally among All."
Sep 17 20:58:16 <roomba>	koala_man: yeah! that's why i drink real sugar mt. dew by the 2-liter instead of 20oz HFCS
Sep 17 20:58:17 <lupine>	indeed, you can always choose not to implement it
Sep 17 20:58:24 <Thuryn>	it's fine for "how much do you want my wheat/steel/mufflers?"  it's bad for literal life necessities
Sep 17 20:58:27 <Dagmar>	It's a qualification that must be met for the resulting software to be considered "free software" by the standards of the FSF
Sep 17 20:58:29 <Samizdat>	(- 'n)'
Sep 17 20:58:36 <Thuryn>	Samizdat, no
Sep 17 20:58:38 <Dagmar>	It's one of four such qualifications.
Sep 17 20:58:40 <brutser>	hi, i am testing in qemu, booting and in grub i don't have keyboard, do i need to load a module for that? or what?
Sep 17 20:58:54 <koala_man>	you know your food industry is messed up when "made with cane sugar" is promoted as a health benefit
Sep 17 20:58:57 <Thuryn>	freedom 0 is the ability to use what you paid for or acquired legally to its fullest extent, without restriction
Sep 17 20:59:07 <lupine>	aye, and that's how we end up back at the start - rms's philosophical jonesing for freedom 0 has done a lot of harm
Sep 17 20:59:10 <Thuryn>	that is, "you can't tell me where and when to use my set of tools"
Sep 17 20:59:11 <Dagmar>	brutser: Just use virt-manager until you've figured out what's necessary for a virtual machine to function
Sep 17 20:59:17 <roomba>	brutser: more likely your qemu configuration is not correct
Sep 17 20:59:17 <Thuryn>	that's all
Sep 17 20:59:30 <Dagmar>	You should *not* be subjecting yourself to this kind of suffering, man
Sep 17 20:59:38 <Samizdat>	"Freedom 2: the freedom to ensure that All remain equal (again, without guns [you know the drill])."
Sep 17 20:59:43 <Thuryn>	the idea that freedom 0 somehow benefits the elites *to an unreasonable extent* is manufactured
Sep 17 20:59:56 <Dagmar>	s/manufactured/insane/
Sep 17 20:59:59 <quitman>	Is it possible to stream from twitch in mplayer?
Sep 17 21:00:04 <lupine>	Thuryn: in fact, it is ture
Sep 17 21:00:06 <lupine>	true*
Sep 17 21:00:08 <brutser>	Dagmar: i use a rom file for bios, and i got really no idea how to load that with virt-manager
Sep 17 21:00:12 <roomba>	koala_man: oh! but these frosted mini-wheats have 10 layers of whole grains!
Sep 17 21:00:13 <Thuryn>	lupine, no.  it's statistically false.
Sep 17 21:00:17 <lupine>	brutser: are you using -machine type=q35 ?
Sep 17 21:00:24 <Thuryn>	"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"
Sep 17 21:00:32 <lupine>	Thuryn: fite me irl
Sep 17 21:00:38 <Dagmar>	brutser: It's just an XML file you have to modify to have an entry that involves that ROM image
Sep 17 21:00:41 <Thuryn>	if 100,000,000 million people benefit, i don't care if an extra 10,000 people also benefit
Sep 17 21:00:57 <lupine>	weeeellllll
Sep 17 21:00:59 <Dagmar>	brutser: If you're trying to do UEFI that's another matter entirely
Sep 17 21:01:09 <Samizdat>	"Freedom 3: the freedom to spread freedom for All to the whole world (you know)."
Sep 17 21:01:11 <lupine>	consider that your definition of "benefit" seems to include "are exploited"
Sep 17 21:01:15 <roomba>	koala_man: all natural non-GMO vegan whole grains!
Sep 17 21:01:26 <brutser>	lupine: no, that gives me a decryption error when using that
Sep 17 21:01:28 <roomba>	koala_man: that means i can eat the whole box in one sitting, right?
Sep 17 21:01:46 <lupine>	decrypting what?
Sep 17 21:02:07 <lokke>	Hello World! may someone of you can tell me how to unload a module from pulseaudio?
Sep 17 21:02:09 <koala_man>	roomba: I once saw a review of a burger place that said "The buns are too soft and taste like paper mache" with a follow-up from three weeks later that said "Sorry, I'm new to the US and have since learned that this is just the way bread is here", and I relate so hard
Sep 17 21:02:12 <brutser>	qemu is giving that error, sorry decoding error
Sep 17 21:02:42 <Dagmar>	looke: rmmod, but that's probably not what you really want to do
Sep 17 21:02:53 <Dagmar>	If it loaded, it was probably needed for something
Sep 17 21:02:59 <KillerWasp>	lokke, #pulseaudio
Sep 17 21:02:59 <lupine>	anyway, you'll note how the freedom 0 discussion neatly derailed the epstein discussion#
Sep 17 21:03:05 <lupine>	I commend this tactic to the house
Sep 17 21:04:01 <akoana>	lokke: pactl unload-module <module-name>
Sep 17 21:04:39 <akoana>	lokke: or pactl unload-module <id>
Sep 17 21:04:41 <kreyren>	I need to make accurate graph of +1000 X and +1000Y looking for recommendation assuming that it's expected to be shared online
Sep 17 21:04:46 <kreyren>	to define function for wine
Sep 17 21:04:51 <kreyren>	*winetricks
Sep 17 21:05:57 <roomba>	koala_man: Haha I just visited the frosted miniwheats website and i'm having a really difficult time finding the nutrition facts label...
Sep 17 21:06:04 <M6HZ>	Hello, in which directory should users place their certificates?
Sep 17 21:06:20 <roomba>	koala_man: instead there's this: https://www.frostedminiwheats.com/en_US/nutrition.html - which is not telling the complete story
Sep 17 21:06:28 <KillerWasp>	M6HZ, depend... for what program?...
Sep 17 21:06:30 <lokke>	Dagmar:rmmod... that looks wrong to me thins i'll unload a pulse module not from kernel. i'll check out #pulseaudio
Sep 17 21:06:46 <Dagmar>	M6HZ: ANywhere they want, provided it's not being made readable by other users
Sep 17 21:06:49 <M6HZ>	KillerWasp any programs
Sep 17 21:07:00 <Dagmar>	M6HZ: They probably wanna stick it somewhere the software they're trying to use can see it tho
Sep 17 21:07:26 <Dagmar>	If they don't mind the certificates being relatively useless they're welcome to make them world-readable
Sep 17 21:07:32 <KillerWasp>	M6HZ, not's any programs, is in general... is in ca-certificates/ maybe...
Sep 17 21:07:41 <Dagmar>	...depending on what kind of cert it is
Sep 17 21:07:45 <KillerWasp>	/etc/ca-certificates/*
Sep 17 21:07:53 <koala_man>	roomba: amazon photos show they're 20% sugar by weight -___-
Sep 17 21:08:02 <Dagmar>	Certs used directly by users should not be in /etc
Sep 17 21:08:25 <roomba>	koala_man: found em. 10.4 grams for "5 mini wheats" and let's suppose the average person is eating a bowl of 15-20 of them.
Sep 17 21:08:27 <M6HZ>	Dagmar, sure, I'm looking for the standard compliant way to do it. (If it does exist).
Sep 17 21:08:33 <Dagmar>	For system-level certs, people should probably try and stick with the heirarchy their distribution uses
Sep 17 21:08:44 <roomba>	i can't believe i used to eat cereal
Sep 17 21:08:54 <koala_man>	grain based dessert
Sep 17 21:08:58 <roomba>	yeah basically lol
Sep 17 21:09:09 <Dagmar>	M6HZ: no, you're out of luck there.  Most things follow the lead of openssl that uses IIRC /etc/pki by default
Sep 17 21:09:11 <roomba>	it's terrible. that's like 50-60g of sugar for 1 bowl.
Sep 17 21:09:22 <de-facto>	lokke, pactl list short modules ; pactl unload-module <number>
Sep 17 21:09:29 <Dagmar>	Where do you find room for the marshmallows?
Sep 17 21:10:26 <roomba>	koala_man: you know the food system is messed up when somebody saying breakfast cereal is "grain based dessert" is considered a conspiracy theorist.
Sep 17 21:10:36 <KillerWasp>	M6HZ, by default is in /etc , but if's for each user access, in ~/.config/ , for any other custom configuration, wherever you want...
Sep 17 21:11:04 <Dagmar>	Just saying "certficate" really doesn't give enough information
Sep 17 21:11:21 *	roomba heads off to pour a bowl of lucky charms
Sep 17 21:11:21 <Dagmar>	There are different types of certs, used by different things, for different reasons
Sep 17 21:11:31 <KillerWasp>	well, my response also is generic... :S
Sep 17 21:11:37 <Dagmar>	roomba: The marshmallows are more air than anything else
Sep 17 21:11:55 <M6HZ>	Dagmar, so you think that certificates that do not come along with a package properly installed with a package manager should be placed /etc?
Sep 17 21:12:06 <roomba>	Dagmar: please don't ruin my lunch. the marshmallows are REAL!
Sep 17 21:12:11 <M6HZ>	I'm talking about certificates in .pem.
Sep 17 21:12:17 <Dagmar>	M6HZ: I think that criteria has almost nothing to do with where they should go
Sep 17 21:12:18 <hexnewbie>	Aren't marshmallows made from pipe heat insulation?
Sep 17 21:12:39 <Dagmar>	I crushed some up with a spoon once and was pretty disappointed
Sep 17 21:13:02 <KillerWasp>	well, my response also is generic... :S
Sep 17 21:13:11 <M6HZ>	Dagmar which criteria?
Sep 17 21:13:46 <Dagmar>	M6HZ: Both.  .pem is just a storage format and means nothing by itself.  Distributions are generally only going to be shipping CA certs, which they have a place for already
Sep 17 21:14:03 <KillerWasp>	roomba, all the cereals is made by monsanto, is why're builded with half-plastic for made more abundant...
Sep 17 21:14:06 <KillerWasp>	:)
Sep 17 21:14:14 *	lupine sends KillerWasp some quaker oatgs
Sep 17 21:14:18 <lupine>	"I think you'll find..."
Sep 17 21:14:29 <Dagmar>	M6HZ: If you're trying to add a CA cert to the system, there is a particular place it should go so that it can be added to the system's keystore and *not* completely disappear the next time they update the pki-certificates package
Sep 17 21:14:48 <Dagmar>	This place will be documented by your distribution
Sep 17 21:14:54 <Dagmar>	...as will the update mechanism.
Sep 17 21:15:04 <lupine>	in debian, consider /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
Sep 17 21:15:21 <M6HZ>	Nice.
Sep 17 21:15:26 <KillerWasp>	i dislike the quaker, The last time I ate it seemed like a paste to wallpaper walls...
Sep 17 21:15:49 <Dagmar>	Apache and nginx can use certs.  Theirs go in a difference place entirely
Sep 17 21:16:08 <KillerWasp>	lupine, ^
Sep 17 21:16:09 <Dagmar>	Mail servers can use certs as well. THeirs usually go in a separate place from that
Sep 17 21:16:09 <lupine>	I don't think there's any room for religious intolerance here
Sep 17 21:16:27 <Dagmar>	Depending on what type of cert it is, both webservers and mail servers may be able to use it, whcih also changes things
Sep 17 21:16:42 <Dagmar>	So you have to specify WHAT THE CERT IS before anyone's going to be able to give you more useful information
Sep 17 21:16:52 <Dagmar>	Being vague isn't helpin
Sep 17 21:16:54 <lupine>	well, ca-certificates is mostly about ssl as a *client*. as a server is a whole other game
Sep 17 21:17:10 <KillerWasp>	game?? what game??
Sep 17 21:17:24 <lupine>	like billiards, but with chess pieces
Sep 17 21:17:24 <Dagmar>	...and no, we're not going to sit here and explain all the possible uses of certificatess.
Sep 17 21:19:07 <roomba>	KillerWasp: only the best monsanto cereals for our president!
Sep 17 21:19:21 <roomba>	We must keep KillerWasp in good health
Sep 17 21:19:29 <KillerWasp>	it's remember my server game...
Sep 17 21:19:36 <KillerWasp>	hahahahah
Sep 17 21:21:04 *	lupine passes round some competing GSK/AZ cereal
Sep 17 21:23:38 <M6HZ>	lupine. Alright, and what is the standard directory to place certificates for an nginx/apache/etc server?
Sep 17 21:24:02 <lupine>	it's configurable *shrug*
Sep 17 21:24:05 <roomba>	yeah
Sep 17 21:24:16 <lupine>	I don't use those any more, I have a web server that requests its own ssl certs
Sep 17 21:24:26 <M6HZ>	lupine, are you saying that there is no standard? :)
Sep 17 21:24:27 <roomba>	there is a lot of variation across distros - and nobody really knows what to do with certs on their distro of choice either
Sep 17 21:24:31 <lupine>	pretty much
Sep 17 21:24:42 <lupine>	I thjen use cronjobs to distribute the certificates it gets to other daemons (like mail), again, at configurable locations
Sep 17 21:25:07 <Dagmar>	roomba: Speak for yourself.  I know where to put my certs
Sep 17 21:25:27 <lupine>	e.g. I have /etc/exim4/exim.crt which is a copy of the certificate my web server gets
Sep 17 21:25:37 <Dagmar>	As a last resort, the Principle of Least Astonishment generally applies just fine
Sep 17 21:25:53 <roomba>	Dagmar: sheesh! alright! can you at least put the gun down? nobody needs to die today!
Sep 17 21:26:19 *	Thuryn thwaps roomba on the back of the head.
Sep 17 21:26:24 <Thuryn>	don't exaggerate like that.  it's rude.
Sep 17 21:26:30 <Dagmar>	...of course to apply the Principle of Least Astonishment generally requires people actually read documentation instead of guessing.
Sep 17 21:27:19 <Dagmar>	I actually had to fix a DKIM cert just this morning
Sep 17 21:27:48 <Dagmar>	It bears almost no resemblance to the way SSL/TLS certs work
Sep 17 21:27:49 <lupine>	I am holding off on updating my email box from stretch to buster
Sep 17 21:27:53 <lupine>	I am hopefully maddy will be ready first
Sep 17 21:28:00 <lupine>	hopeful*
Sep 17 21:35:21 <M6HZ>	lupine, sorry I got disconnected from the webchat...
Sep 17 21:36:07 <Guest92494>	Hi,
Sep 17 21:36:15 <jim>	hi
Sep 17 21:36:21 <lupine>	you didnae miss anything
Sep 17 21:37:05 <M6HZ>	lupine, Ok, you were writing to me about the right place for certificates.
Sep 17 21:37:34 <Guest92494>	Let's say I am starting a X app from terminal and it keeps printing some output. Is there a way to pipe & monitor this output with for example combination of xargs watch grep ?
Sep 17 21:38:00 <Sleaker>	hmm so I've got a server running x on :0, and an ltsp client setup that's getting a session from that server, it's display gets set to IP:7 - I'm trying to run xdotool to minimize a window on the client display. the command works fine if it actually gets run from a terminal on the client, but doesn't work when run from the main server even if I force override the DISPLAY env variable.
Sep 17 21:38:27 <M6HZ>	lupine, So, from what I understand, I should either place them wherever I want, or in /etc/distrib-specific-dir ?
Sep 17 21:39:47 <section1>	Sleaker, maybe something relate to xhost
Sep 17 21:40:50 <section1>	Sleaker, you can try for testing run xhost + on the client ...then try the coomand on the server.
Sep 17 21:45:32 <M6HZ>	lupine are you still there?
Sep 17 21:47:35 <Sleaker>	section1: hmm xhost on the client doesn't do anything, as it has no x server.
Sep 17 21:47:50 <Sleaker>	atleast that's what it seems
Sep 17 22:43:51 *	Disconnected ()

Sep 17 22:47:52 <Supernovice>	you know, i guess, my name is gaybrush deepthroat
Sep 17 22:48:09 <gry>	he was being offtopic, please do not repeat it
Sep 17 22:48:39 <rascul>	Illya groups don't need it unless you want a group password i guess
Sep 17 22:49:01 <Supernovice>	im feeling stupid
Sep 17 22:49:10 <rascul>	Illya i honestly don't know if a line is required in shadow for each user, i've always had it there
Sep 17 22:49:15 <Illya>	and non-login users don't need it either? I'm jsut wondering if I can add a user/group by only editing the passwd/group files
Sep 17 22:49:43 <rascul>	usually best to use usermod or groupmod to do it
Sep 17 22:49:50 <Crypticode>	^.^ see just idiot
Sep 17 22:49:51 <rascul>	or useradd and groupadd i mean
Sep 17 22:49:52 <Illya>	yeah I know it's created by the tools but I'm not convinced it's actually needed. The reason I'm wondering is I need to patch an offline system to add a system user/group
Sep 17 22:52:36 <Crypticode>	thanks gry for being that kind to me, i was almost smothering on his *****
