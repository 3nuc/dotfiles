Sep 09 10:30:53 <Nomikos>	must've not paid attention much in the past few decades
Sep 09 10:31:34 <fructose>	If you don't want a solution, that's up to you.
Sep 09 10:32:38 <Nomikos>	Lady_Aleena: maybe try later when there's socially well-adjusted people with iphones around
Sep 09 10:33:03 <fructose>	Nomikos: Bad advice
Sep 09 10:33:33 <Lady_Aleena>	Also, if you are thinking emulators, they are not as reliable as a real device.
Sep 09 10:33:51 <Nomikos>	fructose: too bad no one around has any better
Sep 09 10:34:05 <fructose>	Nomikos: How do you know? No one has asked.
Sep 09 10:36:16 <Nomikos>	educated guess
Sep 09 10:37:39 <fructose>	That'd explain the error.
Sep 09 10:39:41 <moeng00>	hai
Sep 09 10:39:47 <Buck>	hoi
Sep 09 10:40:08 <moeng00>	Can I use console.log() in browser or is there something with wider support
Sep 09 10:40:30 <Buck>	you can use console.log() in browser
Sep 09 10:42:29 <eirikb>	There used to be a time....
Sep 09 10:43:01 <Buck>	tell us about the old times eirikb!
Sep 09 10:43:05 *	Buck gathers around the campfire
Sep 09 10:43:17 <Nomikos>	elinks javascript support is disabled by default, can't think of any others :p
Sep 09 10:43:42 <Buck>	elinks?
Sep 09 10:43:47 <Buck>	I only know of lynx and links
Sep 09 10:44:07 <Nomikos>	fork of links
Sep 09 10:44:16 <eirikb>	This was a time long ago, a time before one needed 54 000 npm packages to write "Hello, world!"
Sep 09 10:44:19 <Buck>	http://elinks.or.cz/
Sep 09 10:44:20 <Natasha>	>> ELinks - Full-Featured Text WWW Browser
Sep 09 10:44:21 <moeng00>	Well if someone does not have js support then their problems will be much more serious as the app is react
Sep 09 10:44:24 <Buck>	The current unstable version is 0.12pre6, released on 2012-10-30.
Sep 09 10:45:08 <Nomikos>	Buck: yea >.> there was a time when it was better than links
Sep 09 10:45:25 <Buck>	apparently links has a graphical front end as well
Sep 09 10:45:34 <Nomikos>	that's just cheating
Sep 09 10:45:37 <Buck>	yeah
Sep 09 10:45:41 <Buck>	stay with your leest, links

Sep 09 10:46:16 <Buck>	wb Mrbuck
Sep 09 10:47:12 <Mrbuck>	hi Buck
Sep 09 11:09:06 <jan6>	links2 > elinks ;p
Sep 09 11:09:17 <jan6>	except no js, of course...
Sep 09 11:09:39 <jan6>	ah the days before js ruined everything ;p
Sep 09 11:15:48 <Buck>	jan6: the 80s?
Sep 09 11:36:47 <jan6>	and 90s
Sep 09 11:36:53 <jan6>	and 00s
Sep 09 11:37:16 <jan6>	I said ruined, not existed ;p
Sep 09 12:50:20 <spinningCat>	i am sorry if it is off topic questyion please let me knopw
Sep 09 12:50:58 <Mrbuck>	spinningCat: what is the question ?
Sep 09 12:51:39 <spinningCat>	i have two seperate machine on network so external ip of those is same. I want to give one of them access via RDP. Do i need to use proxy or something to avoid confliction between thiese two machines?_
Sep 09 12:53:12 <Nomikos>	spinningCat: I suspect this is extremely similar to what you did for SSH and HTTP
Sep 09 12:53:16 <Mrbuck>	load balancer may help ?
Sep 09 12:53:21 <Mrbuck>	I don;t know
Sep 09 12:53:43 <Mrbuck>	just redirect the traffic
Sep 09 12:55:22 <spinningCat>	Nomikos,  yes it is similar confusing part is two different machine with same external ip isnt it weird?
Sep 09 12:55:43 <Nomikos>	spinningCat: no, because they have different internal ip addresses
Sep 09 12:55:58 <Nomikos>	the external ip address is the router's ip address
Sep 09 12:56:10 <spinningCat>	okay yeah
Sep 09 12:56:32 <spinningCat>	let me check something real quick
Sep 09 12:57:17 <Nomikos>	if the network is a house with different rooms (machines) the router is the front door. all mail has to be addressed to the front door, once it's inside you can figure out what goes to which room
Sep 09 12:57:19 <spinningCat>	oh yeah
Sep 09 12:57:30 <spinningCat>	what i need is internal ip for rdp connection
Sep 09 12:57:49 <spinningCat>	i understood the metaphor
Sep 09 12:58:01 <spinningCat>	it was really clear Nomikos
Sep 09 12:58:14 <spinningCat>	i guess i need to check internal ip of machine
Sep 09 12:58:20 <Nomikos>	so you just need to add another NAT entry
Sep 09 12:58:30 <spinningCat>	with internal ip
Sep 09 12:58:46 <Nomikos>	same way you did the other two
Sep 09 12:58:52 <spinningCat>	yeap
Sep 09 12:59:05 <spinningCat>	easy peasy leamon squeezy
Sep 09 12:59:30 <spinningCat>	it is more fun than writing piece of cake
Sep 09 12:59:32 <spinningCat>	hahahehahe
Sep 09 15:25:53 <chazapp>	In mongodb shell : db.getCollection("doc").find({"features.creationTimestamp": {"$gte": "2019-09-09T14:03:43.094Z"}}); => 0  results instead of 3. Did i miss anything ?
Sep 09 15:26:33 <chazapp>	"features" is an embeded document of doc
Sep 09 15:50:18 <shomon>	hi, what is a good way of telling what country someone is in for the purpose of payment? So to buy some boots if I am in the UK but have a spanish browser and a US browser, what country should I offer as default for the payment button? Or should I just always ask the user?
Sep 09 15:50:34 <shomon>	sorry spanish browser and us OS I mean
Sep 09 15:51:43 <Nomikos>	I'd offer a select item where your best guess is pre-selected
Sep 09 15:52:33 <shomon>	I agree! so my question part 2: what logic should I consider in providing that best guess?
Sep 09 15:53:11 <shomon>	I'm sure someone must have written about it or even written a script/library etc for it
Sep 09 15:53:13 <ThePendulum>	shomon: the browser's geolocation API
Sep 09 15:53:22 <Nomikos>	browsers send a preferred language header, I think
Sep 09 15:55:55 <shomon>	thanks! It's a bit like determining what language to show the content in, but a bit different as maybe they speak italian but pay in swiss francs for example.

Sep 09 17:36:32 <Buck>	hi kh
Sep 09 17:36:37 <Buck>	bugger
Sep 09 17:41:30 <spinningCat>	hey there
Sep 09 17:43:08 <spinningCat>	i wrote ServerAlias on my server normally i can access the domain with spesific port like url:8000. And in /etc/hosts i gave my ip that i connect to my server and url address that i set in apache2.conf. But i cannot ping the ServerAlias. What can be the possible reason of that?
Sep 09 17:45:59 <Nomikos>	is it still saying "name or service not known" ?
Sep 09 17:46:16 <spinningCat>	let me check
Sep 09 17:46:48 <spinningCat>	yes
Sep 09 17:48:53 <spinningCat>	well well well
Sep 09 17:49:08 <spinningCat>	i also cannot ping actually domain name
Sep 09 17:49:12 <spinningCat>	test.vaysbuy...
Sep 09 17:49:18 <spinningCat>	it just waits
Sep 09 17:49:22 <Nomikos>	can you ping google.com
Sep 09 17:49:42 <Nomikos>	the actual domain name isn't registered yet I think
Sep 09 17:49:57 <spinningCat>	yes
Sep 09 17:50:08 <spinningCat>	i can ping google.com
Sep 09 17:51:09 <spinningCat>	what do you mean?
Sep 09 17:51:14 <spinningCat>	problem is .com?
Sep 09 17:55:07 <Nomikos>	if you ping the ServerName, it does echo the IP address, correct?
Sep 09 18:00:29 <spinningCat>	it just waits
Sep 09 18:00:43 <spinningCat>	but it return ip address yes
Sep 09 18:00:48 <Nomikos>	ok
Sep 09 18:01:13 <Nomikos>	I've no idea why your system is not using /etc/hosts then
Sep 09 18:01:38 <spinningCat>	why it waits
Sep 09 18:01:45 <spinningCat>	i am confused
Sep 09 18:02:14 <Nomikos>	it waits because it's waiting for the ping response, that is what ping does
Sep 09 18:02:36 <Nomikos>	but it means it found the ip address, otherwise it would simply stop
Sep 09 18:02:38 <spinningCat>	okay there is no response that means something is wrong in your side may be
Sep 09 18:03:02 <spinningCat>	because i am pinging your side and i can react it from browser
Sep 09 18:03:12 <Nomikos>	my side?
Sep 09 18:03:34 <spinningCat>	i mean i can see welcome page when i write ip address on browser
Sep 09 18:03:41 <spinningCat>	but i cannot ping it
Sep 09 18:03:47 <spinningCat>	isnt it weird?
Sep 09 18:03:54 <spinningCat>	i mean i cannot get package
Sep 09 18:04:18 <spinningCat>	i am just asking
Sep 09 18:04:45 <Nomikos>	> the ping is just a check to see if it can find the right IP address for the domain name
Sep 09 18:04:54 <spinningCat>	okayi understand
Sep 09 18:05:03 <spinningCat>	but also show package is recieving right
Sep 09 18:05:17 <spinningCat>	and i cannot recieve packages
Sep 09 18:05:25 <spinningCat>	let me try telnet
Sep 09 18:05:47 <Nomikos>	what packages
Sep 09 18:05:58 <Nomikos>	packets?
Sep 09 18:06:19 <spinningCat>	packaet
Sep 09 18:06:21 <spinningCat>	sorry 84 packets transmitted, 84 received, 0% packet loss, time 83134ms
Sep 09 18:06:34 <spinningCat>	telnet also cannot connect ip address
Sep 09 18:06:39 <spinningCat>	should i give port?
Sep 09 18:06:56 <Nomikos>	wtf. that line from ping says it worked
Sep 09 18:07:19 <spinningCat>	it is for google
Sep 09 18:07:41 <Nomikos>	ok, that wasn't confusing at all
Sep 09 18:07:53 <Nomikos>	so. ignore the ping packets. it's about the IP address/
Sep 09 18:07:55 <spinningCat>	check your p.m. by the way
Sep 09 18:08:06 <Nomikos>	I have
Sep 09 18:08:12 <spinningCat>	why i could domain with telnet
Sep 09 18:08:30 <spinningCat>	oops
Sep 09 18:08:39 <spinningCat>	why i couldnt connect domain with telnet
Sep 09 18:09:00 <Nomikos>	I'm guessing port, yeah
Sep 09 18:09:35 <Nomikos>	did you notice about how it found the right IP address though?
Sep 09 18:09:41 <spinningCat>	ye
Sep 09 18:09:45 <Nomikos>	because DNS is set correctly for that address
Sep 09 18:09:52 <spinningCat>	yeah
Sep 09 18:10:05 <spinningCat>	the problem is using alias
Sep 09 18:10:08 <spinningCat>	that is all
Sep 09 18:10:12 <Nomikos>	no
Sep 09 18:10:17 <spinningCat>	hmm?
Sep 09 18:10:24 <Nomikos>	it can not find the IP address..
Sep 09 18:10:51 <spinningCat>	what is that?
Sep 09 18:10:58 <spinningCat>	well
Sep 09 18:11:07 <spinningCat>	alias cannot find ip address
Sep 09 18:11:18 <spinningCat>	but i mix them in /etc/hosts
Sep 09 18:11:20 <Nomikos>	alias is not involved
Sep 09 18:11:33 <Nomikos>	your ping command can not find the IP address to send the pings to
Sep 09 18:11:42 <Nomikos>	it doesn't reach the right system
Sep 09 18:11:50 <spinningCat>	got it
Sep 09 18:12:04 <Nomikos>	and even if it did it wouldn't touch apache, because ping pings IP addresses, not webservers
Sep 09 18:12:12 <Nomikos>	the webserver is not involved for ping, at all
Sep 09 18:12:17 <Dazzling_Viking>	have you tried turning it off and back on again?
Sep 09 18:12:26 <Dazzling_Viking>	ping is its own protocol
Sep 09 18:12:32 <spinningCat>	turning of what?
Sep 09 18:12:38 <Dazzling_Viking>	the thing
Sep 09 18:12:45 <spinningCat>	ping?
Sep 09 18:12:47 <Nomikos>	camfm
Sep 09 18:12:55 <spinningCat>	what is camfm?
Sep 09 18:13:16 <Nomikos>	cat on the keyboard
Sep 09 18:13:44 <KingOfKingOfKing>	Nomikos was it spinning?
Sep 09 18:13:58 <Nomikos>	KingOfKingOfKing: it is now >.>
Sep 09 18:14:04 <KingOfKingOfKing>	:O
Sep 09 18:14:04 <spinningCat>	damn
Sep 09 18:14:37 <Nomikos>	spinningCat: reboot your computer, try the server alias from your browser
Sep 09 18:14:38 <spinningCat>	Nomikos,  i am not still clear why i cannot access alias
Sep 09 18:14:52 <KingOfKingOfKing>	cat your /etc/hosts
Sep 09 18:14:53 <spinningCat>	reboot server you mean
Sep 09 18:14:55 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 09 18:14:58 <KingOfKingOfKing>	and show us your terminal
Sep 09 18:15:00 <Nomikos>	yes, do that first
Sep 09 18:15:06 <spinningCat>	sure
Sep 09 18:15:07 <Nomikos>	the termuinal thing
Sep 09 18:15:12 <Nomikos>	not the server, leave the server alone
Sep 09 18:15:13 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 09 18:17:41 <spinningCat>	here https://i.itsosticky.com/wliplb.png
Sep 09 18:18:26 <Dazzling_Viking>	and what are you trying to ping?
Sep 09 18:19:27 <spinningCat>	actual domain name
Sep 09 18:19:33 <spinningCat>	i set in apache.conf
Sep 09 18:19:37 <Dazzling_Viking>	test-www.vaysbuy.com?
Sep 09 18:19:40 <Nomikos>	yes
Sep 09 18:19:46 <spinningCat>	not this one
Sep 09 18:19:53 <Nomikos>	wait waht
Sep 09 18:19:57 <spinningCat>	that give me error
Sep 09 18:20:00 <spinningCat>	gave me
Sep 09 18:20:06 <spinningCat>	i tried to ping
Sep 09 18:20:15 <spinningCat>	but that gave me service not known error
Sep 09 18:20:20 <Dazzling_Viking>	tell us, what did you try to ping
Sep 09 18:20:32 <Dazzling_Viking>	show us
Sep 09 18:20:37 <Dazzling_Viking>	love us
Sep 09 18:20:44 <spinningCat>	yeah okay
Sep 09 18:20:48 <spinningCat>	but i wont kiss you
Sep 09 18:21:17 <spinningCat>	i used that command ping test-www.vaysbuy.com
Sep 09 18:22:05 <spinningCat>	i got service not known
Sep 09 18:22:32 <spinningCat>	i suppose when i type alias it should check the ip behind it right?
Sep 09 18:22:56 <Nomikos>	when you type alias where
Sep 09 18:23:17 <Dazzling_Viking>	you ping on the same server right?
Sep 09 18:23:22 <Dazzling_Viking>	not on different machines?
Sep 09 18:23:46 <Nomikos>	wait.. wtf
Sep 09 18:23:54 <spinningCat>	same server
Sep 09 18:23:58 <Nomikos>	spinningCat: is that /etc/hosts on YOUR computer, or on the server?
Sep 09 18:23:58 <spinningCat>	i got same error
Sep 09 18:24:04 <spinningCat>	Nomikos,
Sep 09 18:24:10 <spinningCat>	on server
Sep 09 18:24:31 <spinningCat>	should it be in my computer?
Sep 09 18:24:37 <Nomikos>	that's.. not helping much. yes.
Sep 09 18:24:45 <spinningCat>	well
Sep 09 18:24:49 <Dazzling_Viking>	if you're pinging from your computer, it must be on your computer
Sep 09 18:24:53 <spinningCat>	if someone want to react the alias
Sep 09 18:25:03 <Dazzling_Viking>	it has to be in the DNS
Sep 09 18:25:07 <spinningCat>	Dazzling_Viking,  i tried to ping o server too
Sep 09 18:25:19 <spinningCat>	i got same error service not known
Sep 09 18:25:40 <Nomikos>	put it in your local /etc/hosts first
Sep 09 18:25:49 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 09 18:25:50 <Nomikos>	on your own machine
Sep 09 18:25:56 <Nomikos>	then reboot your machine, and try again
Sep 09 18:26:32 <spinningCat>	reboot machine or apache?
Sep 09 18:26:38 <Nomikos>	your machine
Sep 09 18:26:42 <Nomikos>	your own machine
Sep 09 18:26:44 <Nomikos>	not the server
Sep 09 18:26:55 <spinningCat>	damn
Sep 09 18:27:06 <spinningCat>	if someone use that alias for accessing website
Sep 09 18:27:13 <Nomikos>	not apache either, your own local machine from which you are pinging and where you are adding the /etc/hosts entry
Sep 09 18:27:16 <spinningCat>	should i add this info to each computer?_
Sep 09 18:27:30 <spinningCat>	hmm?
Sep 09 18:27:42 <Dazzling_Viking>	ping doesn't give a flying fuck about apache
Sep 09 18:27:46 <spinningCat>	so i need to add that line manually to each computer
Sep 09 18:27:48 <Nomikos>	when you want others to test it, they should register the domain
Sep 09 18:27:59 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 09 18:28:03 <spinningCat>	or adding this
Sep 09 18:28:05 <Nomikos>	and then you can add the DNS entry, and then you don't need /etc/hosts
Sep 09 18:28:23 <spinningCat>	let me start my machine now
Sep 09 18:28:35 <Nomikos>	/etc/hosts is only for testing and debugging locakkasdfnjofpppffft
Sep 09 18:35:24 <spinningCat>	i have one router and two server if electricity goes off and you start router and servers, the internal ip will change right?
Sep 09 18:36:08 <Nomikos>	it might, but you can make them static
Sep 09 18:36:23 <Nomikos>	it's a setting on the VM OS
Sep 09 18:36:45 <spinningCat>	yeah my aim is to make static
Sep 09 18:36:57 <spinningCat>	should i purchase some services?
Sep 09 18:37:02 <Nomikos>	what for?
Sep 09 18:37:10 <spinningCat>	to use static ip?
Sep 09 18:37:19 <Nomikos>	18:36:22 < Nomikos> it's a setting on the VM OS
Sep 09 18:37:20 <spinningCat>	some dns services
Sep 09 18:37:26 <spinningCat>	ah
Sep 09 18:37:39 <spinningCat>	can i givve any ip?
Sep 09 18:37:57 <Nomikos>	any that is allowed by the router
Sep 09 18:38:11 <spinningCat>	how can i check that ?
Sep 09 18:38:14 <spinningCat>	Do you know?
Sep 09 18:38:44 <spinningCat>	if you dont know that is okay
Sep 09 18:38:47 <Nomikos>	I would just use the IP address that is has right now
Sep 09 18:39:02 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 09 18:39:06 <Nomikos>	different routers have different interfaces, I'd have to sit down behind one
Sep 09 18:39:09 <spinningCat>	so you just make the ip static
Sep 09 18:39:16 <Nomikos>	yes
Sep 09 18:39:27 <spinningCat>	this ip that router define recently
Sep 09 18:39:30 <spinningCat>	that make sense
Sep 09 18:39:46 <spinningCat>	okay better to check how to make ip static ubuntu
Sep 09 18:39:53 <spinningCat>	that should not be hard
Sep 09 18:40:06 <spinningCat>	i can do for windows server and for windoews 7 too
Sep 09 18:40:23 <spinningCat>	two problems in a box
Sep 09 18:40:33 <spinningCat>	i have solutions YAY
Sep 09 18:40:50 <spinningCat>	thanks Nomikos
Sep 09 18:40:54 <Nomikos>	yw
Sep 09 18:41:02 <spinningCat>	i try to configure server machine
Sep 09 18:41:11 <spinningCat>	for creating working environment
Sep 09 19:35:20 <patrickk>	Hello, I am setting up a server (centos 7.5) and will host around 10-15 websites in them. Should I go with Apache or nginx?
Sep 09 19:45:30 <jan6>	personally I'd go with nginx, but it might depend on stuff like how heavy load they get, etc... for < 1000 people per day I don't think there's noticeable difference...maybe...
Sep 09 19:52:14 <Buck>	patrickk: either is fine
Sep 09 19:55:20 <jan6>	^^iirc there was only neglegable dfference, performance-wise
Sep 09 19:59:25 <samsch>	nginx is easier to config IMO. The only thing that apache has better than nginx that I know is htaccess files, which are questionably "good" anyway.
Sep 09 20:03:29 <Buck>	I do prefer nginx's config
Sep 09 20:03:31 <eirikb>	Last server I set up was Caddy, worked fine
Sep 09 20:03:39 <Buck>	apache otoh doesn't require restarts on config changes
Sep 09 20:04:42 <jan6>	eirikb: busybox's httpd also works fine, doesn't mean I'd use it publically ;P
Sep 09 20:06:12 <eirikb>	I used Caddy publically
Sep 10 00:23:50 <praxis>	is there a way to discover the publish/release date of a particular URL?
Sep 10 00:26:03 <praxis>	I can see a modified date in the page source, but it doesn't really reflect the date the information became available, i guess some minor or aesthetic modification was made since the original date
Sep 10 09:55:02 <fructose>	praxis: You can check the Wayback Machine to see if/when it took its first snapshot. There's no universal way to know how long a server has been serving particular data though.

Sep 11 17:39:58 <Nomikos>	the resulting HTML etc, probably, but they'll be keeping the CMS
Sep 11 17:40:07 <Nomikos>	so you'd end up with static files
Sep 11 17:40:59 <Nomikos>	.. unless it's heavy on ajax and does domain checks with minified JS and all that. tbh I don't know. technically you can but it'd be in their interest to make it difficult
Sep 11 17:43:04 <Oberon4278>	Yeah, I was hoping they might offer some kind of "build a site here and export it" option for web developers
Sep 11 17:43:23 <Oberon4278>	but I guess they don't really have an incentive to do that since their model seems to require you to host it with them and then pay to remove their branding
Sep 11 17:45:10 <Oberon4278>	God, professional web development sucks so hard.  Everyone wants a Rolls Royce site at Honda Civic prices.

Sep 17 12:58:39 <Nomikos>	is there any reason why "git stash" could take bloody ages?
Sep 17 13:05:15 <ko_lo>	depends on the commit your are stashing
Sep 17 13:05:17 <ko_lo>	but it seems odd
Sep 17 13:12:50 <Nomikos>	ko_lo: small differences in just a few files, but it takes like 6 seconds
Sep 17 13:13:05 <Nomikos>	(yesthatsbloodyages :| )
Sep 17 13:13:15 <ko_lo>	how many commits ?
Sep 17 13:13:37 <Nomikos>	in the repo in total?
Sep 17 13:14:07 <Nomikos>	it's just stashing uncommitted changes
Sep 17 13:15:06 <Nomikos>	seems to me all it needs to do is store the diffs and checkout the changed files
Sep 17 13:16:29 *	Nomikos considers (against his better judgement) writing a function that does just that o.o
Sep 17 14:56:26 <Dazzling_Viking>	Nomikos git stash should be pretty quick
Sep 17 14:56:39 <Dazzling_Viking>	seeing as it basically just is a commit that adds everything
Sep 17 14:57:03 <Dazzling_Viking>	popping or applying a commit would take a bit more time, as it gotta merge the changes
Sep 17 14:59:03 <Nomikos>	yeah see

Sep 17 15:01:24 <Dazzling_Viking>	that sounds correct
Sep 17 20:57:42 <dfive>	Hi. What is the difference between idempotent and nullipotent and how to use them?
Sep 17 21:02:59 <systemfault>	dfive: IIRC idempotent requests can actually mutate as long as the result is always the same... Like DELETE or PUT for example
Sep 17 21:03:14 <systemfault>	Nullipotent don't change anything... like GET/HEAD/OPTIONS
Sep 17 21:20:16 <dfive>	Okay. What do you think about using POST with a standard form, GET with links and PUT and DELETE with ajax and and a window relocation. There you only have one data obect in a put methid at the client and a visual response of the site by reliading the page. That seems to be a good combination of the technologies, isn't it?
Sep 17 21:25:29 <dfive>	systemfault: yes. There is only POST and GET supported in HTML forms.  Idempotent changes belong to be handled by the user. That is some kind of mutual exclusion to be implemented there. Is there a difference between machine-machine and machine-human interaction?
