Aug 31 11:29:24 <w1d3m0d3>	how do I tell linux to send dmesg over serial?
Aug 31 11:29:38 <w1d3m0d3>	as fast as possible so that I don't miss a panic
Aug 31 11:39:03 <ld50>	w1d3m0d3: append something like "console=ttyS0,115200n8" to the kernel commandline
Aug 31 11:45:02 <lwlvl>	are there any known issues with net-dns/bind-9.14.4? I experience many crashes after the last system-update... https://bpaste.net/show/3pPJ
Aug 31 11:45:57 <lwlvl>	probably some issues with libraries?
Aug 31 12:00:15 <w1d3m0d3>	ld50: why the n8?
Aug 31 12:08:12 <ld50>	w1d3m0d3: it's part of the parameters for the serial interface. "8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit"
Aug 31 12:17:05 <sharp15>	any consequences of trying to enable python virtualenv for plex-media-server?  was going to use the ebuild attached at the end of https://bugs.gentoo.org/681858
Aug 31 12:24:11 <sharp15>	nm.  seems its already done with the one i'm using.  not sure what b.g.o is using for the "diff" on that file.
Aug 31 12:29:29 <w1d3m0d3>	ah okay, thanks ld50
Aug 31 12:33:25 <sharp15>	this may be a silly question.  can anyone here tell me what a "git pull request" is supposed to be?  i was under the impression you could pull from any repository you could browse.
Aug 31 12:41:46 <sharp15>	are there directions for using git to do a lan scale overlay?  not just local machine.
Aug 31 12:53:47 <sharp15>	Forza: were you referring to some template overlay?  only changing the "minor version" didn't work.
Aug 31 12:58:27 <tarelerulz>	is there a command line spotify?
Aug 31 13:05:21 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Aug 31 13:08:02 <Forza>	sharp15: look for portage local overlay
Aug 31 13:08:14 <Forza>	On the wiki
Aug 31 13:20:49 <sharp15>	Forza: thank you for responding i succeeded in fixing the issues i meant to address to you specifically.  i didn't realize i had the wrong version and forgot that the files wouldn't be on the gentoo server yet.  i hand downloaded and then changed the minor version as apparently plex has moved up to 1.16.5.x
Aug 31 13:21:48 <sharp15>	Forza: I found the overlay stuff on gentoo and i think i can make my request work with rsync.  i was just curious if anyone had seen instructions for doing it with git.
Aug 31 13:32:59 <sven^>	hi. There was a critical CVE for dovecot 2 days ago but the fixed version wasn't stable till yesterdayish, because it depends on masked packages (binutils-libs-2.31.1-r6, libmysqlclient-18). So now it seems the maintainer just made the ebuild stable without updating the dependencies. Is there anything I can do about this? Like where can I submit a patch? Or is there even a patch underway and I should just give it another day?
Aug 31 13:35:34 <BtbN>	I updated to the fixed version right away and did not need to unmask anything else.
Aug 31 13:37:33 <sven^>	are you on amd64?
Aug 31 13:38:29 <BtbN>	yes
Aug 31 13:38:39 <BtbN>	Is your world up to date?
Aug 31 13:38:54 <sven^>	uh, I think I misread the message
Aug 31 13:39:08 <sven^>	those are unrelated packages that are installed and masked
Aug 31 13:39:10 <sven^>	sorry
Aug 31 14:36:38 <meandrain>	what package contains ifconfig command?
Aug 31 14:37:39 <ajak>	sys-apps/net-tools
Aug 31 14:38:08 <ajak>	but you should probably be using iproute2
Aug 31 14:38:39 <meandrain>	ajak: thank you
Aug 31 14:39:21 <meandrain>	yes, I just want to also have ifconfig available just for convenience, since I manage multiple unix OSes and ifconfig is somehow stuck in my brain
Aug 31 14:39:42 <meandrain>	I try to use ip command but sometimes I forget on which OS I am :D
Aug 31 14:54:24 <sharp15>	anyone willing to comment?  my local overlay plex ebuild just collapsed. http://dpaste.com/2K157PD
Aug 31 14:59:07 <ajak>	is that your build log? what does the ebuild look like? (i hope its implicit that this isn't gentoo-supported)
Aug 31 15:00:58 <redsh>	sharp15: virtualenv_start_pms.patch doesn't apply.
Aug 31 15:01:50 <sharp15>	ajak: i understand it isn't but thanks for the reminder.  that is the output in the shell when the ebuild died..
Aug 31 15:03:21 <sharp15>	redsh: ok.  does that mean i can just comment out the "PATCHES=" line and re-do the manifest?
Aug 31 15:04:41 <redsh>	I don't know. I assume the patch is there for a reason. And where did it come from, a commit to the codebase between version 1.x and 1.y that got added to version 1.x in the Gentoo package and obviously won't apply when 1.y is out?
Aug 31 15:05:14 <redsh>	Maybe it fixes some build problems. But sure, just ripping it out could work.
Aug 31 15:06:20 <sharp15>	redsh: i'm sorry.  i understand your "doesn't apply" now. read as "wont complete - wrong file"
Aug 31 15:07:28 <redsh>	That means the patch file doesn't work because the files it's meant to patch have been changed in the meantime, thus invalidating the patch, or maybe they're missing entirely or something.
Aug 31 15:07:53 <sharp15>	redsh: ok.  ty for clarifying.
Aug 31 15:18:36 <noodlepie>	http://dpaste.com/3PA009T -- gnome/gdm install problems! :P
Aug 31 15:18:51 <noodlepie>	I managed to disable cups and gtk 2 and 3 installed ok
Aug 31 15:27:47 <leio>	noodlepie: I don't see any gnome/gdm problems there; you have bluez vs dbus[user-session] problems there, as portage is telling you
Aug 31 15:27:58 <leio>	oh, combined with vino wanting user-session.
Aug 31 15:29:03 <noodlepie>	enable user-session in USE flags?
Aug 31 15:29:32 <noodlepie>	nope - didn;t wor
Aug 31 15:29:34 <noodlepie>	work
Aug 31 15:30:40 <leio>	should work fine.
Aug 31 15:30:53 <leio>	but I need to tweak that in the profiles to not need manual tweaks.
Aug 31 15:31:04 <leio>	but that depends on figuring out if we even want to have vino installed from gnome-extra-apps anymore.
Aug 31 15:31:25 <leio>	you'll need to --changed-use it...
Aug 31 15:31:27 <leio>	maybe
Aug 31 15:31:45 <leio>	basically re-emerge dbus and bluez after putting that in global USE.
Aug 31 15:31:52 <leio>	then proceed with the rest
Aug 31 15:32:01 <noodlepie>	ok
Aug 31 15:32:07 <leio>	bonus points for filing a bug about this manual tweak need out of the box on gnome profile.
Aug 31 15:33:36 <noodlepie>	ok, seems fine, I'll leave it compiling and go get a coffee - thank leio !
Aug 31 15:51:08 <t4nk-freenode>	when I was updating, I saw a mention of one 'conflict', it seems all packages were updated without errors, but what about that conflict? how can I find out what it was about?
Aug 31 15:55:03 <tdr>	t4nk-freenode, sometimes there may be a new version of a library available but the programs you have need a version you already have, so it will choose not to update 'everything' ... its fine.
Aug 31 15:55:54 <noodlepie>	using genkernel to build the kernel, I noticed the .config is pulled in from a /var or /usr subdir. How do I make it use .config in /usr/src/linux please?
Aug 31 15:56:23 <tdr>	noodlepie, there's a switch to direct it, or you can us the --menuconfig switch and load in a config from elsewhere too
Aug 31 15:56:44 <tdr>	noodlepie, genkernel man page should explain the switches
Aug 31 15:56:50 <noodlepie>	ok
Aug 31 15:56:54 <noodlepie>	thanx
Aug 31 15:57:58 <t4nk-freenode>	--kernel-config=/path/to/config-file is the switch I believe, but I don't use genkernel
Aug 31 15:58:43 <noodlepie>	is genkernel config "--config" option the kernel .config file?
Aug 31 15:59:03 <noodlepie>	ERROR: GK_SHARE is not set. Please check used genkernel config file at '/usr/src/linux/.config'!
Aug 31 16:00:17 <tdr>	noodlepie, hrm, i dont know what GK_SHARE is, but my kernel .config doesn't have it
Aug 31 16:00:39 <noodlepie>	ah, its --kernel-config=<file|default>
Aug 31 16:01:32 <noodlepie>	great!
Aug 31 16:03:07 <t4nk-freenode>	the mention about the conflict was vague, tdr, just one line and no additional info. Perhaps next time I should use --verbose-conflicts? I think it'll be ok too; I think there oughtta be a way to list those conflicts though.. but thnx for responding, tdr ;)
Aug 31 16:04:33 <tdr>	t4nk-freenode, another emerge -vaDNU @world may print it again, at least next time there's a package that you can update
Aug 31 16:12:51 <t4nk-freenode>	one more question about that, tdr, I always use '--avuUD' when I update; when I run this there is nothing to merge, but when I use your '-avUDN' there are 46 packages, mostly python stuff... should I be using 'N' from now on?
Aug 31 16:15:29 <tdr>	t4nk-freenode, i think your -U is subset of -N
Aug 31 16:15:44 <tdr>	so its not checking everything it could
Aug 31 16:16:46 <t4nk-freenode>	see, that's what I thought too!.. but the other way around ;) ... mmmm I'll just add the N to my list then
Aug 31 16:18:29 <tdr>	t4nk-freenode, yeah your -U is covered by -N so just replace the letter
Aug 31 16:34:04 <noodlepie>	ello again
Aug 31 16:34:37 <limebeer>	hi hi

Aug 31 17:33:21 <noodlepie>	here's my genkernel.conf.. --> http://dpaste.com/1YA3RA4
Aug 31 17:33:46 <noodlepie>	do you need my .config?
Aug 31 17:47:37 <kurly>	line 138 of your first paste seems relevant; does the source file exist?
Aug 31 17:52:53 <mroh>	where is rwho in gentoo?
Aug 31 17:52:54 <noodlepie>	it looks like genkernel is removing the .config from /usr/src/linux before it baulks
Aug 31 17:53:19 <tdr>	it was running make mrproper, that would nuke the config there
Aug 31 17:53:33 <noodlepie>	emerge --search rwho shows rwhoisd
Aug 31 17:53:40 <noodlepie>	ok
Aug 31 17:57:48 <noodlepie>	ok, it seems happy again now
Aug 31 18:02:04 <mroh>	noodlepie: rwho != rwhois
Aug 31 18:02:11 <noodlepie>	ok
Aug 31 18:02:43 <noodlepie>	http://dpaste.com/1BTDX7J -- latest genkernel.log after kernel build fail
Aug 31 18:04:08 <noodlepie>	it says CPU doesn't support x86_64 but I am using stock install iso and have Xeon/Core2 set in .config
Aug 31 18:04:12 <noodlepie>	odd huh?
Aug 31 18:04:54 <acidfreeze>	on raspbian would /etc/network/interfaces = /etc/conf.d/net on gentoo?
Aug 31 18:05:32 <acidfreeze>	i need to put this modules_wlan0="[b]!iw[/b] !iwconfig !wpa_supplicant" 
Aug 31 18:06:57 <noodlepie>	nned my .config?
Aug 31 18:10:41 <josef64>	yes, please
Aug 31 18:13:04 *	ChanServ gives voice to steils
Aug 31 18:16:36 <noodlepie>	I have DEFAULT_KERNEL_CONFIG="/usr/src/linux/.config" in /etc/genkernel.conf
Aug 31 18:16:41 <noodlepie>	Should this work ok?
Aug 31 18:17:02 <noodlepie>	"genkernel all" seems to revert to the /usr subdir config file instead
Aug 31 18:19:14 <noodlepie>	cc1: error: CPU you selected does not support x86-64 instruction set
Aug 31 18:19:52 <noodlepie>	* Working with Linux kernel 5.2.11-gentoo-x86 for x86

Aug 31 18:19:58 <noodlepie>	hmmpf
Aug 31 18:23:38 <noodlepie>	running make bzImage in /usr/src/linux gives the same !x86_64 error
Aug 31 18:28:26 <noodlepie>	But specifiying "genkernel --kernel-config=/usr/src/linux/.config all" does seem to use that specified config file
Aug 31 18:35:01 <noodlepie>	I;m re-emerging gentoo-sources and genkernel to see if that helps#
Aug 31 18:40:42 <noodlepie>	could it be this --> * ARCH 'x86' detected ... ? Perhaps this should be x86_64?
Aug 31 18:40:50 <noodlepie>	that's in the genkernel.log
Aug 31 18:41:10 <noodlepie>	* Unable to determine LOCALVERSION -- maybe cleaned/fresh sources?
Aug 31 18:41:13 <noodlepie>	* KERNEL_ARCH set to 'x86' ...
Aug 31 18:41:17 <noodlepie>	also from genkernel.conf
Aug 31 18:47:14 <noodlepie>	looks like I got it now - nvidia-drivers is installing off the /etc/kernels/<oldconfig-working> config file
Aug 31 18:47:34 <noodlepie>	wonderful beans!
Aug 31 18:51:06 <noodlepie>	Looks like my .config before moving from /etc/kernels/ was baulked
Aug 31 18:51:16 <noodlepie>	its compiling kernel correctly now
Aug 31 18:51:29 <noodlepie>	and the nvidia driver packages that uses the kernel config is fixed too
Aug 31 18:51:35 <noodlepie>	Great!
Aug 31 18:53:17 <symmetricSnake>	Hello, everyone! :) I am completely new to Gentoo. I just finished my semester, I have a bit of free time now and I am planning to install it to learn more about GNU/Linux. I have mostly been using Fedora and Ubuntu for the past 3 years. What I am most concerned about when installing Ubuntu is security, though; I personally don't know much about security or hardening my system, but I am willing to learn. I
Aug 31 18:53:20 <symmetricSnake>	took a look at the Gentoo security handbook but there was a warning that it is outdated.
Aug 31 18:53:55 <symmetricSnake>	For a home user like myself, what are some good guides that I can follow after installing Gentoo to harden it?
Aug 31 18:54:22 <symmetricSnake>	I mostly use my system for email, web browsing, studying, programming, gaming and watching movies.
Aug 31 18:56:09 <symmetricSnake>	I apologize for asking such a broad (and potentially silly) question. I have been googling this but wasn't able to find anything satisfactory, other than the Gentoo Security Handbook, which has a big warning sign saying that it is probably outdated.
Aug 31 18:56:25 <symmetricSnake>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Security_Handbook
Aug 31 18:57:12 <symmetricSnake>	Actually, a better question would be: is the security handbook really outdated, or can I safely follow it?
Aug 31 18:58:49 <Garbanzo>	I haven't used it but there is a Hardended Gentoo profile
Aug 31 18:59:18 <symmetricSnake>	Oh, I will check that out! Thank you! :)
Aug 31 19:00:14 <Garbanzo>	Though it maybe overkill for what you want, a standard install can be secure too
Aug 31 19:01:31 <t4nk-freenode>	Garbanzo, I just take care to use gentoo-sources, that should go a long way
Aug 31 19:01:46 <t4nk-freenode>	euh... symmetricSnake I meant ;)
Aug 31 19:01:54 <noodlepie>	The KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE option in /etc/genkernel.conf only seems to accept a specific override commmand tempalte - I've put --kernel-config=/usr/src/linux/.config in my build_kernel.sh script - which I use to compile and install the kernel with one command
Aug 31 19:01:58 <noodlepie>	it's ok that way roud
Aug 31 19:02:00 <noodlepie>	round
Aug 31 19:03:07 <symmetricSnake>	Thank you, Garbanzo and t4nk-freenode for your suggestions! :)
Aug 31 19:04:15 <symmetricSnake>	I guess I will start by doing a standard install and then decide what to do after I finish it and set up the rest of the system! :) Well, have a good day everyone! :D
Aug 31 20:02:55 <S0rin>	hey ! I am trying to configure a razer core with gentoo did someone already did that ?
Aug 31 20:03:37 <t4nk-freenode>	presumably, yes.
Aug 31 20:04:08 <S0rin>	:D I mean documented ? t4nk-freenode
Aug 31 20:07:29 <t4nk-freenode>	can't find much
Aug 31 20:08:28 <t4nk-freenode>	perhaps someone in #gentoo-chat knows
Aug 31 20:11:04 <t4nk-freenode>	(I now know it's a gpu-thingie, not a pc ;) )
Aug 31 20:12:18 <S0rin>	t4nk-freenode: thank you :D I will ask them there
Aug 31 21:00:12 <t4nk-freenode>	S0rin, there seems to be an overlay on gpo.zugaina.org ... https://gpo.zugaina.org/Search?search=openrazer this might be useful to you
Aug 31 21:18:13 <noodlepie>	Humph - my kernel build still fails regarding x86-64 not being supported by my selected CPU (incidently Xeon/Core2)
Aug 31 21:18:41 <noodlepie>	I have installed a fresh gentoo-sources and am using config from 5.2.7-gentoo as the base for the new config
Aug 31 21:18:55 <noodlepie>	I can oldconfig and menuconfig ok
Aug 31 21:19:05 <noodlepie>	and the menuconfig shows 64bit selected and Xeon/Core2 also
Aug 31 21:19:19 <noodlepie>	the 5.2.7 config used to work on my old install
Aug 31 21:19:29 <noodlepie>	and oldconfig allows a few new settings
Aug 31 21:19:46 <noodlepie>	but bam, no 64bit (which IS selected) support for my "selected CPU"
Aug 31 21:19:59 <noodlepie>	I will google
Aug 31 21:21:01 <meingtsla>	What stage3 are you using?
Aug 31 21:21:32 <noodlepie>	the latest
Aug 31 21:21:46 <noodlepie>	everything else has been compiling ok
Aug 31 21:21:56 <meingtsla>	Full filename?
Aug 31 21:23:24 <noodlepie>	ok, stage3-i686-20190827T214502Z.tar.xz
Aug 31 21:23:30 <meingtsla>	"i686"
Aug 31 21:23:36 <noodlepie>	ah, do I need amd64
Aug 31 21:23:38 <meingtsla>	Yes.
Aug 31 21:23:48 <noodlepie>	ok will get and install now
Aug 31 21:32:11 <noodlepie>	ok, I can do this myself now, going offline for a while

Sep 02 09:14:27 <tdr>	you moved to 3.6 before you emerged portage?
Sep 02 09:14:29 <needle>	heya, if using wpa_supplicant is there any verbose mode to see what it it is doing, like associating or getting IP address etc.
Sep 02 09:14:30 <tdr>	put it back to 27
Sep 02 09:14:34 <tdr>	emerge will work there
Sep 02 09:14:54 <tdr>	you'll still need to update portage, but at least normal commands should work

Sep 02 09:38:54 <wokko>	psih0man: Try with sane CFLAGS, -Ofast might be an issue ???
Sep 02 09:42:13 <psih0man>	wokko: `"multiple definition of" function` error does not seem to be related to flags; but I'll try it.
Sep 02 09:45:05 <psih0man>	wokko: `"multiple definition of" function` error does not seem to be related to *optimisation* flags; but I'll try it.
Sep 02 09:46:25 <psih0man>	wokko: It seems to be working with -O3. So I was wrong...
Sep 02 09:47:23 <MADEaMeSS>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/8HbB2F63MQ/ how do I resolve this conflict?
Sep 02 09:47:33 <Kelsar>	psih0man: even 03 is not a sane flag
Sep 02 09:47:43 <Kelsar>	-O3
Sep 02 09:47:57 <psih0man>	wokko and Kelsar: Thank you for help.
Sep 02 09:48:09 <psih0man>	Kelsar, I know.
Sep 02 09:48:17 <Kelsar>	you really shouldn't go above -O2, it does give any gain, but it gets weird runtime and buildtime errors
Sep 02 09:48:38 <MADEaMeSS>	emerge -C dev-lang/python-3.7.3 ??
Sep 02 09:49:02 <Kelsar>	no
Sep 02 09:49:04 <Kelsar>	never
Sep 02 09:49:06 <Kelsar>	use -C
Sep 02 09:49:29 <Kelsar>	MADEaMeSS: looks like you used pip global?
Sep 02 09:49:36 <psih0man>	Kelsar: I seem to keep finding on the Internet the information that other distributions, most notably Ubuntu used or is using -O3 when building their packages.
Sep 02 09:49:55 <Kelsar>	psih0man: they need to do one successfull build, with one set of options
Sep 02 09:50:01 <Kelsar>	with one compiller
Sep 02 09:50:03 <MADEaMeSS>	that is why emerge doesnt work anymore... without a path... I used -C getting advise from website
Sep 02 09:50:08 <josef64>	MADEaMeSS: "The current version of portage supports EAPI '6'. You must upgrade to a
Sep 02 09:50:09 <josef64>	newer version of portage before EAPI masked packages can be installed."
Sep 02 09:50:09 <josef64>	^ this is the problem
Sep 02 09:50:45 <josef64>	MADEaMeSS: Try the tip from https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-8128294.html#8128294
Sep 02 09:51:02 <Kelsar>	no
Sep 02 09:51:54 <Kelsar>	should 1st figure out what he did, but i need to go to work ;)
Sep 02 09:52:55 <psih0man>	Kelsar: what is the purpose of having these flags if they aren't stable or cannot be used to optimise the software? I chose Gentoo to be able to generate the most optimised OS for my computers. Maybe the CI needs to at least attempt to run such builds, with -Ofast and -Osize (I hope I remmember it correctly this last one).
Sep 02 09:53:20 <Kelsar>	psih0man: just try to calculate how many variants there are
Sep 02 09:53:32 <psih0man>	Kelsar: have a nice day at work! :)
Sep 02 09:53:47 <Kelsar>	and then you see why this is not possible. if you want to use those flags, you are basically on your own and need to test yourself
Sep 02 09:58:26 <MADEaMeSS>	so basically now, I am stuck not being able to upgrade or install anyrhing till I understand the mess I made earlier. That's why I had not updated for almost 2 yrs :(
Sep 02 09:59:07 <tdr>	all you need to do is unpack a fresh stage3 into a directory, follow the handbook to chroot into there and rebuild
Sep 02 09:59:40 <tdr>	when its done, replace your outside copy with the chroot build directory contents (move the outsdie stuff first, dont try to over-write)
Sep 02 10:01:09 <psih0man>	MADEaMeSS: You can do what tdr is saying, but I would add that it helps to copy over /etc/portage/make.conf, /etc/portage/package* and /var/lib/portage/world.
Sep 02 10:01:34 <tdr>	unless your mess started with putting in odd flags/masks
Sep 02 10:01:41 <tdr>	then skip those :)
Sep 02 10:02:23 <psih0man>	tdr: of course. :) Thanks for the heads up.
Sep 02 10:05:34 <MADEaMeSS>	I paid someone to configure my box. He did amazing work, 4 yrs ago... Then just installed the apps I wanted. Think I'll just pay again a gentoo guru to teamview my station. Any site you recommend? Last time I used kijiji
Sep 02 10:07:21 <tdr>	you know, reading through and doing the setup would go a long way toward being able to fix it next time
Sep 02 10:09:33 <needle>	The question is why in such case to use gentoo, if it is not updated regulary. There are other distros that are much easier to handle.
Sep 02 10:09:44 <needle>	gentoo is not for everyone
Sep 02 10:10:31 <MADEaMeSS>	ok... You are actually right tdr. Would you give me the url to a step by step guide for that fresh stage3 and what to do? My station works but yep it would be awesome to be able to improve it and understand and know what to do and how.
Sep 02 10:11:23 <tdr>	MADEaMeSS, https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64
Sep 02 10:13:03 <tdr>	MADEaMeSS, the hnadbook will get you a bootable system and you have #gentoo to ask for help.  after it's bootable, you'll need X etc but its not all that hard, just takes some time
Sep 02 10:13:44 <MADEaMeSS>	oooooooooooo!!!! I will LOSE the current configuration? :(
Sep 02 10:14:29 <needle>	You will not lose it, if you made a backup from it.
Sep 02 10:15:29 <tdr>	MADEaMeSS, backup your /etc/portage/make.conf  and /var/lib/portage/world and any /etc/portage/package.use file/directory .. .  other than that, you may want your net config or something and you dont have to wipe your /home etc
Sep 02 10:15:40 <wokko>	just don't make a mess :D
Sep 02 10:16:26 <MADEaMeSS>	it MUST be possible to just <fix> the mess I made, without reinstalling the whole thing and starting from scratch
Sep 02 10:16:27 <tdr>	wokko, or do weird things like use musl half of it, ulibc for another half, and use bordland-c++ compiler from 1987 to compile any of it
Sep 02 10:16:43 <wokko>	haha
Sep 02 10:16:44 <tdr>	MADEaMeSS, it may be, if anyone knew what happened
Sep 02 10:17:25 <MADEaMeSS>	I think I know the big mistakes I made, if I paste the commands I typed, can we just reverse the mistake?
Sep 02 10:17:29 <tdr>	MADEaMeSS, but, if it hadn't updated for 2 years, theres a LOT of work to do AFTER it works at all
Sep 02 10:17:42 <tdr>	like welcome to gcc-not-4 :)
Sep 02 10:19:03 <Kelsar>	gentoo needs to be updated regulary in not as long intervalls, i said atleast once a month
Sep 02 10:20:07 <needle>	MADEaMeSS: there is no other way out for you then install it from scratch
Sep 02 10:20:18 <needle>	or use other disto instead
Sep 02 10:21:05 <redsh>	needle: I don't think we even know what the issue is yet.
Sep 02 10:22:04 <wokko>	apparently made a mess :)
Sep 02 10:22:35 <MADEaMeSS>	emerge -C -pva python:3.3 emerge -C x11-proto/xproto is what I can think I did
Sep 02 10:22:37 <redsh>	That's saying that there is an issue, not what it is :P
Sep 02 10:22:56 <tdr>	xproto wouldnt break anything
Sep 02 10:23:05 <tdr>	your python wasn't the version set active either
Sep 02 10:23:24 <redsh>	Would that first command do anything, given the -p ?
Sep 02 10:23:28 <tdr>	but, you really should use emerge -cva to remove things so it checks if things need them first
Sep 02 10:24:03 <redsh>	Doesn't seem like it here.
Sep 02 10:24:46 <tdr>	3.4 was the active python before, so slot 3.3 really was baggage
Sep 02 10:24:49 <MADEaMeSS>	emerge -K1av portage
Sep 02 10:25:05 <tdr>	-K emerges from a pre-built binary
Sep 02 10:26:40 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: does seem anything drastic has happened apart from some odd use of emerge flags/options
Sep 02 10:26:48 <wokko>	doesn't*
Sep 02 10:28:28 <MADEaMeSS>	exactly... To do emerge I have to do the full path first...
Sep 02 10:28:33 <MADEaMeSS>	also did  emerge -C meson
Sep 02 10:29:44 <doc235>	MADEaMeSS, did you run pip as root? just curious
Sep 02 10:30:06 <MADEaMeSS>	YES doc
Sep 02 10:30:24 <doc235>	i got a fix for that. i got it from iamben here
Sep 02 10:30:30 <doc235>	let me get it for you\
Sep 02 10:30:32 <doc235>	one min
Sep 02 10:31:34 <wokko>	/usr/lib/python-exec/python2.7/emerge python-exec
Sep 02 10:31:57 <doc235>	recover from pip run as root
Sep 02 10:32:01 <tdr>	he's got EAPI issues
Sep 02 10:32:07 <doc235>	 /usr/lib/python-exec/python2.7/emerge -1 python-exec
Sep 02 10:33:15 <tdr>	wont work if his portage doesnt support the EAPI of python exec builds:  ./python-exec-2.4.6-r1.ebuild:EAPI=7
Sep 02 10:33:17 <MADEaMeSS>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/yxjx2WjSgw/
Sep 02 10:34:25 <tdr>	see the nice circle.  you need a newer portage to build that but cant because your portage is too old to build the tool
Sep 02 10:34:54 <tdr>	backup configs and build a clean install and skip many days of pain
Sep 02 10:35:51 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: Yeah easier to just reinstall a fresh system
Sep 02 10:36:12 <psih0man>	tdr: isn't a binary portage package available? That way he could bypass the ebuild.
Sep 02 10:36:20 <tdr>	even if you get past this step, there are many long steps to become current again
Sep 02 10:36:32 <tdr>	psih0man, not for something that olf
Sep 02 10:36:33 <tdr>	old
Sep 02 10:36:52 <psih0man>	tdr: I mean the latest portage tool.
Sep 02 10:37:24 <tdr>	point is, even with that, how many gcc versions behind is 2 years?
Sep 02 10:37:44 <tdr>	profile changes, gcc updates ... its going to be a loop of pain
Sep 02 10:38:39 <wokko>	2 years == stale system
Sep 02 10:39:14 <MADEaMeSS>	yes it's the best idea... Then I will at least learn and know what I am doing in the future... Is there a guide that helps saving all the configs? That would be a nightmare to lose
Sep 02 10:39:34 <tdr>	if it was 6 months it wouldnt be too bad, but thats a very long time for someone who hasnt really built things through
Sep 02 10:41:39 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: Just use 'cp', you really only need your kernel config and possible world file, the rest can be redone as you install
Sep 02 10:42:13 <wokko>	possibly*
Sep 02 10:45:16 <wokko>	You could run 'eix-test-obsolete' to check your package.* if you like also just in case
Sep 02 10:47:16 <MADEaMeSS>	No, I am frustrated and will setup another desktop and do a complete install from scratch and learn. That is a must so I can update, install things I want and so on but, is there freelancer who do Gentoo IT on teamviewer who could just make a miracle and fix, update everything?
Sep 02 10:47:58 <tdr>	#gentoo isn't really for that, its for helping folks who are doing an install, not a marketplace
Sep 02 10:49:32 <MADEaMeSS>	wokko, here is the log it gave me
Sep 02 10:49:33 <MADEaMeSS>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/CnP3Qpmr4Y/
Sep 02 10:51:11 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: Yeah better off starting a fresh then clean up all that :)
Sep 02 10:52:42 <wokko>	line 256 'Installed packages with a version not in the database (or masked):' Found 204 matchs :)
Sep 02 10:53:51 <MADEaMeSS>	ok... then allow a non knowledgeable guy to ask, please patience lol... Fresh install... I will lose sound, have to fuck around for days to make it work? Lose all the applications I installed? Have to reinstall everything? Aurora? Firefox? X? KDE? Internet? Apps? EVERYTHING?
Sep 02 10:54:27 <wokko>	Language Please
Sep 02 10:54:47 <MADEaMeSS>	oups
Sep 02 10:55:41 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: But think of it as a shiny new car
Sep 02 10:58:15 <MADEaMeSS>	lol... DEFINITIVELY, You are not the one who paid SEVERAL hundred of dollars to have it built a few yrs ago!!! >.<
Sep 02 10:59:07 <wokko>	It will be free this time if you do it yourself....
Sep 02 11:00:11 <wokko>	I'll even throw in a virtual/beer :)
Sep 02 11:02:46 <MADEaMeSS>	ok! I do it wokko! :)
Sep 02 11:05:08 <MADEaMeSS>	so make a gentoo CD. erase the drive completely and start from scratch?
Sep 02 11:05:24 <twnqx>	gentoo is weird...
Sep 02 11:05:25 <twnqx>	2019-09-02 10:35:40 (11.9 MB/s) - ‘/usr/portage/distfiles/chromium-77.0.3865.56.tar.xz.__download__’ saved [733257056/733257056]
Sep 02 11:05:25 <twnqx>	!!! Couldn't download 'chromium-77.0.3865.56.tar.xz'. Aborting.
Sep 02 11:05:37 <twnqx>	any idea what could cause this failure?
Sep 02 11:08:05 <twnqx>	hm looks like it could be related to my nfs server going "not responding" all the time...
Sep 02 11:17:45 <MADEaMeSS>	So Wokko? I'll accept that virtual beer once I have created my own gentoo box but is the best way just to erase all the partitions after downloading the gentoo install cd? Or just install on top of the current setup?
Sep 02 11:18:36 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: Follow the handbook and yes nuke drive and start fresh
Sep 02 11:19:34 <MADEaMeSS>	ok! Have a good day. See you in a week. :)
Sep 02 11:21:37 <wokko>	MADEaMeSS: Good luck, some advice... I find if you just do the base install then boot into your new gentoo and do your updates first then X, then install your desktop/window manager and the rest of your system
Sep 02 11:24:02 <lioh>	hi. if i set the boot flag on the /boot partition in parted, according to the manual using: set 2 boot on, the partition is flagged as bios,esp. Can I still format it in ext for the boot partition or do i have to format it fat32?
Sep 02 11:24:33 <lioh>	in general do i have any control over the fact if it's set bios only or bios, esp? is this an autodetected thing?
Sep 02 11:24:53 <tdr>	lioh, what are you trying to acheive?
Sep 02 11:24:54 <redsh>	If it's the ESP, then I believe it has to be FAT32, unless your firmware just so happens to have support for ext filesystems and is willing to read it.
Sep 02 11:25:27 <redsh>	Which it probably doesn't.
Sep 02 11:25:28 <tdr>	lioh, ESP needs to be fat32 normally basically unless its mac and then it can read a couple other types.
Sep 02 11:25:34 <lioh>	it is an installation in a vmware. i am a bit suprised that it uefi is enabled there.
Sep 02 11:25:45 <lioh>	can i force it not to be esp?
Sep 02 11:26:01 <tdr>	lioh, if you're bios booting you can format /boot as anything you'd like
Sep 02 11:26:17 <redsh>	If you want a UEFI system, then you have to have a ESP somewhere, whether it's /boot or not.
Sep 02 11:26:53 <tdr>	lioh, if you have control over the config for your vm, you can set it not to uefi boot
Sep 02 11:27:25 <lioh>	hmm, firmware type is set to bios in vmware workstation on that vm
Sep 02 11:27:47 <tdr>	ok so it wont efi boot then
Sep 02 11:27:57 <lioh>	so which part is signalizing that this is flagged as esp then in parted?
Sep 02 11:28:09 <lioh>	it's more about the boot, esp flags which are automatically set
Sep 02 11:28:23 <redsh>	It's a GPT flag, I believe.
Sep 02 11:28:39 <tdr>	yes, gpt partitioning
Sep 02 11:28:49 <lioh>	so i can disable it somehow
Sep 02 11:28:53 <tdr>	you can bios boot but still use gpt parittioning.
Sep 02 11:29:17 <redsh>	If you don't use UEFI, then I think you can just ignore the ESP flag.
Sep 02 11:29:26 <lioh>	the strange thing is that fdisk -l lists this partition as type EFI-System, but maybe that's because it cannot handle gpt so good.
Sep 02 11:29:37 <lioh>	redsh, okay, i format it ext2
Sep 02 11:29:55 <redsh>	That's the partition type.
Sep 02 11:30:00 <lioh>	another thing that i did not understand: the first partition (bios boot) does not have to be formatted, right?
Sep 02 11:30:11 <redsh>	I don't think the partition type should matter either.
Sep 02 11:30:30 <redsh>	lioh: Yes. Don't touch it at all.
Sep 02 11:32:22 <lioh>	okay, it says later: "When using ext2, ext3, or ext4 on a small partition (less than 8GB), then the file system must be created with the proper options to reserve enough inodes." In the example the /boot partition is just 128M, so should I mkfs.ext2 -T small /dev/sda2 instead if just mkfs.ext2?

Sep 02 12:13:21 <lioh>	redsh, i mean on a new install. in the doc it says one should not select a 17.1 profile yet, but i wonder if that's also true on a pure 64bit system.
Sep 02 12:13:50 <redsh>	Does `eselect profile show` not display anything on a fresh stage3 then...?
Sep 02 12:14:13 <redsh>	If it shows a 17.0 profile, then I'd assume the stage3 was built for 17.0, not 17.1
Sep 02 12:14:58 <lioh>	ah, i don't know because i have already selected the profile i want
Sep 02 12:15:29 <redsh>	Oh, right, there's an easy way to check.
Sep 02 12:15:32 <redsh>	Does /lib32 exist?
Sep 02 12:15:49 <lioh>	no, only /lib and /lib64
Sep 02 12:16:01 <redsh>	Then I believe it should be 17.1
Sep 02 12:16:12 <lioh>	as mentioned i downloaded the pure 64bit stage3 not multilib
Sep 02 12:16:20 <redsh>	... Err.
Sep 02 12:16:31 <redsh>	Right, 17.1 doesn't really do anything on non-multilib profiles, I guess.
Sep 02 12:16:59 <lioh>	okay.
Sep 02 12:17:19 <lioh>	are all this news i can show with eselect news also online somewhere?
Sep 02 12:18:04 <redsh>	https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/
Sep 02 12:30:00 <lioh>	hmm, it fails on sys-apps/sandbox-2.13: http://termbin.com/4z03
Sep 02 12:30:55 <lioh>	as written in the docs i have selected the profile and then tried to upgrade the @world set
Sep 02 12:31:13 <amitprakash>	What's pulling in libGL here? https://pastebin.com/5RSYkat2
Sep 02 12:31:45 <sheep>	I don;t see libGL there
Sep 02 12:32:05 <amitprakash>	Yeah, but the application crashed in gdb w/ Couldn't open libGL.so.1: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Sep 02 12:32:08 <sheep>	epoxy and wayland-server probably pull it in
Sep 02 12:32:35 <amitprakash>	Epoxy is built with -Dglx=no -Dx11=false -Degl=yes
Sep 02 12:32:41 <amitprakash>	Shouldn't be really pulling in libgl
Sep 02 12:34:15 <sheep>	it could be loading it with dlopen. But on my system ldd says /usr/lib64/libgtk-3.so.0 is linked to libGL.so.1
Sep 02 12:34:47 <amitprakash>	I think epoxy is indeed loading it w/ dlopen which it shouldn't be
Sep 02 12:34:51 <redsh>	It's libgtk-3 => libcario => libGL here.
Sep 02 12:35:03 <redsh>	Err, libcairo
Sep 02 12:35:56 <amitprakash>	Neither for me, https://pastebin.com/zXc5KSJs
Sep 02 12:37:04 <redsh>	lioh: Are you sure you are currently on a nomultilib profile? Since you appear to have abi_x86_32 set on sandbox and it's having trouble producing a 32-bit binary.
Sep 02 12:37:59 <amitprakash>	sheep: verified its epoxy, Binary file src/libepoxy.so.0.0.0 matches
Sep 02 12:38:04 <amitprakash>	Except ldd doesn't list it
Sep 02 12:39:44 <lioh>	redsh, i have downloaded and extraced the nomultilib stage3
Sep 02 12:39:53 <lioh>	is there anything else i need to be aware of?
Sep 02 12:40:06 <redsh>	lioh: Right, but what profile are you currently on?
Sep 02 12:40:15 <redsh>	eselect profile show
Sep 02 12:40:58 <lioh>	it shows the gnome profile that i have selected
Sep 02 12:41:05 <redsh>	lioh: Please post the full name.
Sep 02 12:41:42 <lioh>	default/linux/amd64/17.1/desktop/gnome
Sep 02 12:41:52 <redsh>	Well, it's not a no-multilib profile, there's your issue.
Sep 02 12:41:54 <lioh>	some profiles have a no-multilib extension
Sep 02 12:42:04 <lioh>	so for gnome i need a multilib setup?
Sep 02 12:42:08 <Kelsar>	no
Sep 02 12:42:11 <amitprakash>	No multilib looks like default/linux/amd64/17.1/no-multilib
Sep 02 12:42:11 <lioh>	i mean for anything dekstop related?
Sep 02 12:42:25 <amitprakash>	lioh: You need multilib for stuff like steam/proton
Sep 02 12:42:27 <Kelsar>	no, you can do that, just have less good default use flags
Sep 02 12:42:27 <lioh>	yes, i have seen them but i wanted a desktop profile.
Sep 02 12:42:31 <amitprakash>	For everything else, no multilib is fine
Sep 02 12:42:56 <redsh>	You might need it for games and some other precompiled software, but you should be able to use GNOME just fine on a profile that doesn't explicitly include the word "gnome"
Sep 02 12:43:16 <lioh>	so how can i install a gnome profile with no-multilib?
Sep 02 12:43:31 <lioh>	or do i have to install a no-multilib profile first and then emerge gnome?
Sep 02 12:43:32 <redsh>	I think you could make a custom profile which depends on both no-multilib and desktop/gnome, but I'm not sure how supported that is :D
Sep 02 12:43:33 <Kelsar>	you don't, you select a no-multilib profile and set USE by yourself
Sep 02 12:43:59 <lioh>	hmmm, Keslar i think i am not yet there.
Sep 02 12:44:05 <Kelsar>	lioh: profiles are really just USE defaults (+some stuff)
Sep 02 12:44:47 <redsh>	abi_x86_32 is forced on on sandbox on multilib profiles, afaict
Sep 02 12:45:16 <Kelsar>	lioh: do emerge --info, copy the USE line, switch profile over and use the copied USE line as tempalte for your make.conf
Sep 02 12:45:25 <amitprakash>	sheep: Bug in mesa is causing this pain..  eglplatform depends on X
Sep 02 12:45:45 <Kelsar>	lioh: you need to emerge gnome anyways, regardless of profile
Sep 02 12:50:14 <lioh>	Kelsar, so i have now selecte the gnome profile and copied only the content of USE= to my make.conf. now i select the no-multilib profile and try again?
Sep 02 12:51:16 <redsh>	Proifiles can set some package-specific flags too.
Sep 02 12:51:36 <redsh>	Checking in profiles/targets/desktop/gnome can't hurt.
Sep 02 12:52:57 <lioh>	http://termbin.com/iy3g
Sep 02 12:53:37 <redsh>	"pam? ( !static )" means "if pam is set, then static must not be set"
Sep 02 12:53:41 <redsh>	(USE flags)
Sep 02 12:53:53 <lioh>	this error i get now when i try to emerge @world with the gnome use flags while choosing the 17.1 no-multilib profile.
Sep 02 12:55:41 <redsh>	Do you want busybox to be statically linked or do you want it to have PAM support?
Sep 02 12:55:55 <lioh>	statically
Sep 02 12:56:48 <redsh>	Then add the line "sys-apps/busybox -pam" to some file in /etc/portage/package.use/ (you may have to create the package.use directory yourself)
Sep 02 12:57:01 <redsh>	That turns off USE=pam for that package.
Sep 02 12:58:56 <lioh>	is it recommended to create one file for all my custom use flags of a file for every package?
Sep 02 12:59:40 <Kelsar>	lioh: you can do it how you like
Sep 02 12:59:41 <redsh>	You can even just have /etc/portage/package.use as a single file, but I'd recommend making it a directory since sorting stuff is easier that way.
Sep 02 12:59:58 <redsh>	i.e package.use itself is a file, not a directory with a single file.
Sep 02 13:00:43 <redsh>	It's not hard to change from a single file to a directory + multiple files though.
Sep 02 13:01:36 <lioh>	okay
Sep 02 13:01:42 <lioh>	now i got: http://termbin.com/ip65
Sep 02 13:01:45 <lioh>	what is that about?
Sep 02 13:02:21 <lioh>	can i just accept it?
Sep 02 13:03:16 <redsh>	Some thing(s) wants "x11-libs/libxcb xkb" and "dev-libs/libpcre2 pcre16" in package.use

Sep 02 14:03:33 <Jens>	I've read https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Version_specifier and I'm still unsure. If I want to keep dev-lang/ruby at 5.1.*, what do I put in package.mask?
Sep 02 14:03:45 <Jens>	Portage says ">dev-lang/lua-5.1*" is invalid.
Sep 02 14:04:47 <lioh>	leio, so it could look something like that? http://termbin.com/x2ta
Sep 02 14:05:23 <sheep>	Jens: ~dev-lang/lua-5.1*
Sep 02 14:05:37 <leio>	lioh: no, you seem to be modifying the existing profile, which will get overwritten on next sync. That or you don't realize the entries in there are relative or absolute paths.
Sep 02 14:06:22 <Jens>	sheep: Thank you.
Sep 02 14:07:16 <lioh>	leio so i have to set it with absolute paths?
Sep 02 14:07:20 <sheep>	Jens: you do know that lua versions greater than 5.1 are already masked, right?
Sep 02 14:07:27 <Jens>	Hmm --> "Invalid atom in /etc/portage/package.mask: ~dev-lang/lua-5.1*"
Sep 02 14:07:53 <Jens>	sheep: Yea, but I'm just guarding against the posibility that they some day may not be.
Sep 02 14:07:58 <leio>	lioh: or relative, but relative to /etc/portage/make.profile/ (which you were supposed to make your own dir, not a symlink that eselect profile manages).
Sep 02 14:08:17 <sheep>	Jens: are you certain that things will break with lua 5.2 or 5.3?
Sep 02 14:09:20 <sheep>	Jens: sorry, I misread the wiki. =dev-lang/lua-5.1*
Sep 02 14:09:31 <Jens>	I haven't tried. But this is some old terrible unmaintained software that claims to require 5.1, and I'm not in the mood for taking chances with it. It's a miracle it even compiles still.
Sep 02 14:09:55 <lioh>	like this: http://termbin.com/7tzm leio
Sep 02 14:10:07 <lioh>	ah, now i understand. i missed the symlink part
Sep 02 14:10:09 <leio>	Jens: you wouldn't be p.masking 5.1 to keep 5.1.
Sep 02 14:10:40 <leio>	Jens: you'd be maybe p.masking newer instead, but they already are, you'd just enforce it for longer, and then get into trouble whenever 5.1 gets removed.
Sep 02 14:11:02 <Jens>	Hmm.
Sep 02 14:11:27 <leio>	Jens: but I'm not sure when that will happen - nothing newer is available yet still, and no-one is working on it. The plan is to have 5.1, 5.2 and so on all co-installable, but it's a lot of work; and it's a lot of work to have only one too, but newer one, due to similar problems as you are fearing about (stuff not working with newer).
Sep 02 14:12:00 <leio>	[14:49:53] <+leio> you can make a manual mix-in profile
Sep 02 14:12:00 <leio>	[14:50:00] <+leio> remove the /etc/portage/make.profile
Sep 02 14:12:00 <leio>	[14:50:06] <+leio> create it as a directory instead, with an eapi and parent file in them
Sep 02 14:12:01 <leio>	lioh: ^^
Sep 02 14:12:27 <leio>	the eapi file should contain the line "5" without quotes.
Sep 02 14:12:35 <Jens>	Hmm. I'll just forget about this masking business, and let future Jens deal with it, if it becomes an issue.
Sep 02 14:12:46 <lioh>	leio, yes, this is what i have done now
Sep 02 14:13:06 <leio>	may want to undamage the symlinked profiles parent file too, with a rsync perhaps.
Sep 02 14:18:14 <lioh>	okay, i have to think about all that and maybe swith/reinstall to a multilib setup anyhow tomorrow
Sep 02 14:19:44 <lioh>	because now i am in that sandbox situation again: http://termbin.com/4z03
Sep 02 14:24:29 <BtbN>	How is this matrix spam-fleet not banned yet? oO
Sep 02 14:25:22 <daemon>	I wondered that a few times -_-
Sep 02 14:25:54 <wraeth>	Just ignore joins/parts/quits if it's an issue.
Sep 02 14:26:09 <daemon>	client does not support it per mask unfortunatly
Sep 02 14:32:16 <amitprakash>	What does flag-o-matic  replace-flags do?
Sep 02 14:33:18 <wraeth>	If flag 'foo' is found, replace with 'bar'. See https://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/flag-o-matic.eclass/index.html
Sep 02 14:33:53 <amitprakash>	I did refer that.. by this documentation, it should allow me to override compiler definitions, correct?
Sep 02 14:34:17 <amitprakash>	specifically, I am trying to replace-flags "-DVK_USE_PLATFORM_XCB_KHR" "-DVK_USE_PLATFORM_WAYLAND_KHR"
Sep 02 14:35:17 <wraeth>	It operates on {ADA,C,CPP,CXX,CCAS,F,FC,LD}FLAGS variables.
Sep 02 14:35:25 <amitprakash>	Got it! Thanks
Sep 02 14:42:28 <petteyg>	LLVM has directories /usr/lib/llvm/7/lib{32,64}. I
Sep 02 14:43:04 <petteyg>	I am having rocm ebuilds fail due to not finding cmake files in those directories. Was there some step in the lib32->lib migration I missed?
Sep 02 14:43:40 <redsh>	I don't have /usr/lib/llvm/7/lib32/ here, but lib and lib64 are there.
Sep 02 14:44:36 <sheep>	was sys-devel/llvm rebuilt since you changed profiles? and what is the full output of rocm failing?
Sep 02 16:41:28 <noodlepie>	Hiya guys - I'm having a mare getting nvidia-drivers to work - I have "intel i965 nouveau nvidia" in make.conf as VIDEO_CARDS and ACCEPT_LICENSE="*" but am getting a GPL-incompatible error message - I will post the log in a second
Sep 02 16:41:56 <BtbN>	You're gonna have to pick either nvidia or nouveau. They are mutually exclusive.
Sep 02 16:42:04 <noodlepie>	ok, I'll go with neauveua
Sep 02 16:42:33 <BtbN>	Be aware that nouveau performs horribly, and you might as well just ignore the nvidia card then, and use intel exclusively.
Sep 02 16:42:39 <noodlepie>	thanks BtbN
Sep 02 16:43:06 <BtbN>	Also, an Optimus setup is not straight forward and involves a lot of fidling around with X configs and xrandr.
Sep 02 16:43:39 <doc235>	there is a section for that
Sep 02 16:43:56 <noodlepie>	in the handbook, doc235 ?
Sep 02 16:43:57 <BtbN>	The section is in need of a rework with Nvidias latest driver now.
Sep 02 16:44:12 <BtbN>	Since they introduces proper runtime switching. I don't think that's covered yet?
Sep 02 16:44:23 <noodlepie>	rightoh
Sep 02 16:50:42 <DarthM>	hello, i just tried to create an ebuild for jupyterhub, which is python and pretty straight forward, but in the build process it is calling npm to download some stuff which is not working because of the missing network connectivity during the emerge process. Is there something i can do, to make it happen anyway?
Sep 02 16:53:19 <DrEeevil>	DarthM: iirc the nodejs bits are optional
Sep 02 16:53:35 <mattmatteh>	DarthM: as a wild guess, you might tryto emerge -1a net-libs/nodejs
Sep 02 16:53:58 <DarthM>	nodejs is already installed, because it's a dependency
Sep 02 16:53:59 <DrEeevil>	mattmatteh: that doesn't help with node modules (fetched with npm)
Sep 02 16:54:07 <DarthM>	this is the message "npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/bootstrap failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org:443"
Sep 02 16:54:12 <mattmatteh>	DrEeevil: oh, thanks
Sep 02 16:54:13 <DrEeevil>	npm is pretty much the most careless way to throw stuff onto a system
Sep 02 16:54:15 <DarthM>	npm is also installed
Sep 02 16:55:16 <DarthM>	i had it before that the emerge process/(sandbox?) is not allowed during the compile/build process to communicate with the outside?
Sep 02 16:56:03 <DarthM>	only SRC_URI/GIT.... is the only way to download sources?
Sep 02 16:56:13 <DarthM>	so npm has no connectivity to download something
Sep 02 16:56:36 <DrEeevil>	network sandbox, and that's a very good idea
Sep 02 16:56:53 <DarthM>	and npm is used in the python setup.py for jupyterhub
Sep 02 16:58:22 <twnqx>	hm. using -j32 causes so heavy IO that other things slow to a crawl
Sep 02 16:58:33 <twnqx>	maybe i should switch back to a ramdisk...
Sep 02 16:59:34 <DrEeevil>	twnqx: so you can swap more? ;)

Sep 03 10:27:22 <macroprep>	is gentoo geared towards compiling linux from scratch?
Sep 03 10:27:32 <macroprep>	eg EVERYTHING has to be compiled
Sep 03 10:27:56 <rjp421>	Polynomial-C, thanks! :)
Sep 03 10:28:23 <Xelnor>	macroprep: you may install binary version of a few packages (chromium, firefox, libreoffice)
Sep 03 10:28:33 <Xelnor>	but you usually compile everything
Sep 03 10:28:57 <macroprep>	including the kernel and stuff?
Sep 03 10:29:08 <JCaesar>	macroprep: Given that I've had many friends complain about "meeh, absolutely no binary packages for gentoo"… yes. (although I think there are some for chromium and libreoffice, because you simply can't compile them on small machines.)
Sep 03 10:29:22 <JCaesar>	Of course. The kernel config is everyone's favourite plaything, no?
Sep 03 10:29:23 <MalakymR>	yes kernel, although stage4 now has kernel
Sep 03 10:29:37 <redsh>	Not for Chromium, but there's Google Chrome.
Sep 03 10:29:42 <redsh>	(which is binary)
Sep 03 10:29:50 <JCaesar>	Ah, right...
Sep 03 10:30:21 <macroprep>	so this would be easier to port to a different architecture than archlinux cus arch provides prebuilt binaries right
Sep 03 10:30:46 <redsh>	Sure, I guess. It already supports a relatively wide range of architectures as well.
Sep 03 10:31:19 <macroprep>	as i want to port to arm64 Android hardware
Sep 03 10:31:31 <twnqx>	arm64 is already a supported target
Sep 03 10:31:48 <redsh>	As in, To ARM64 or to *Android*?
Sep 03 10:31:58 <twnqx>	android as it's core instead of a pure linux... not so much
Sep 03 10:32:00 <rjp421>	prebuilt is sometimes unnecessarily bloated with stuff you dont need or want using up space and ram
Sep 03 10:32:01 <macroprep>	android itself
Sep 03 10:32:11 <macroprep>	or rather, its hardware
Sep 03 10:32:22 <macroprep>	for example, exynos GPU
Sep 03 10:32:22 <redsh>	There's a difference between aarch64 and *ANDROID*.
Sep 03 10:32:25 <macroprep>	CPU*
Sep 03 10:32:35 <macroprep>	mali GPU, and so on
Sep 03 10:32:48 <redsh>	Since the latter comes with its own weird libc that you'l need to have a lot of patches for to work around its quirks and missing features and so on.
Sep 03 10:33:46 <redsh>	... Maybe not if you just roll with glibc in a prefix or something, I guess? But it'll probably be a bigger headache than just regular Linux on aarch64.
Sep 03 10:34:16 <macroprep>	specifically i want to build a GNU Linux based GSI for android
Sep 03 10:34:29 <macroprep>	(Generic System Image)
Sep 03 10:34:55 <macroprep>	for Treble devices
Sep 03 10:35:07 <redsh>	I think there was a GSoC project around that?
Sep 03 10:35:28 <garth>	do you mean you want to install Linux on a device that is meant/came with Android?
Sep 03 10:36:09 <macroprep>	more or less
Sep 03 10:36:10 <redsh>	https://jsteward.moe/gsoc-2018-final-report.html
Sep 03 10:37:05 <Xelnor>	macroprep: you might want to hang out on #gentoo-arm too ;)
Sep 03 10:37:20 <garth>	what's the less part?
Sep 03 10:38:27 <macroprep>	garth, lol
Sep 03 10:46:02 <kaste>	HI, I have some issues with pulse again. For some reason the audio "blocks", similar to alsa when not using dmix. I can only play sound on one app, sometimes none
Sep 03 10:46:24 <kaste>	When I start others they play no audio or even hang (like videos not advancing)
Sep 03 10:46:28 <kaste>	What could be the issue
Sep 03 10:55:17 <Necktwi>	just opened https://bugs.gentoo.org/693384
Sep 03 11:01:45 <ccokee>	Hi I'm doing an update for first time in like 4 months... I've upgraded portage succesfully but now a few packages ask me for abi_x86_32 USE FLAG, if I add it to this packages, other packages ask for the USE FLAG to and Im affraid this could end up in a big loop so... why do I need those now? (for glib pkgconfig and pkgconfig-1 at first) and... should I add abi_x86_32 as global an forget about it?
Sep 03 11:28:32 <biggs>	why can't easytag find any MP3 files?
Sep 03 11:29:03 <biggs>	yes my folder have permissions. not even running as root lets it find any mp3 files
Sep 03 11:29:15 <biggs>	or any files from any format
Sep 03 11:29:27 <wokko>	ccokee: Work out why or what wants the useflag change before comitting to the change... '-t' option might come in handy eg 'emerge -pvtuDN @world'
Sep 03 11:35:40 <biggs>	right, I've just understood way
Sep 03 11:35:42 <biggs>	why*
Sep 03 11:35:50 <biggs>	apparently there's an mp3 use flag
Sep 03 11:36:43 <biggs>	but for some reason the package repository web browser doesn't show it https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-sound/easytag
Sep 03 11:47:01 <freakynl>	Is there any tool available in gentoo to do a ipv6 router solicitation? rdisc6 doesn't seem to be in portage
Sep 03 11:47:51 <freakynl>	nvm package is called ndisc6
Sep 03 11:48:07 <Kryczek>	freakynl: thank you for sharing :)
Sep 03 11:49:57 <BtbN>	radvd, dnsmasq
Sep 03 11:52:34 <satmd>	solicitation... client or server?
Sep 03 11:52:54 <Triffid_Hunter>	smartd[3979]: Device: /dev/sda [SAT], SMART Usage Attribute: 194 Temperature_Celsius changed from 142 to 136 -- is there some way for that to show the actual temperature rather than the raw value?
Sep 03 11:53:14 <Triffid_Hunter>	pretty sure my disk isn't quite that hot.. :P
Sep 03 11:56:25 <josef64>	biggs: Yes, packages.gentoo.org is broken :-/  (please don't use it for information). Using better equery uses package :)
Sep 03 11:56:25 <josef64>	equery uses media-sound/easytag
Sep 03 11:57:29 <josef64>	equery is from app-portage/gentoolkit package
Sep 03 11:59:06 <BtbN>	Triffid_Hunter, does smartctl -x not show it correctly?
Sep 03 12:00:08 <Triffid_Hunter>	BtbN: 194 Temperature_Celsius     -O----   139   139   000    -    43 (Min/Max 14/47) -- looks fine in the right-side column
Sep 03 12:00:23 <Triffid_Hunter>	BtbN: but 'value' is 139 for some reason, and that's what's showing up in my log
Sep 03 12:00:51 <BtbN>	Yeah, value is the raw value the disc reports. And then it needs some device specific magic to calculate the actual temperature
Sep 03 12:15:51 <biggs>	yeah that's how i ended up finding out josef64, thanks. do you know how long packages.gentoo.org has been broken?

Sep 03 13:11:25 <ccokee>	josef64: thx but, how did you determine that is that block and not some other in the list?
Sep 03 13:11:37 <ccokee>	since there are several blocks...
Sep 03 13:19:27 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 03 13:21:19 <josef64>	Conflict: 8 blocks (2 unsatisfied)
Sep 03 13:21:19 <josef64>	ccokee: ^ The blocks with small "b" solved portage itself. The problem is blocks with big "B"
Sep 03 13:21:19 <josef64>	see line 1279 and 1367
Sep 03 13:22:53 <josef64>	And "sci-libs/blas-reference required by @selected" meaning, it is in your world file
Sep 03 13:23:47 <josef64>	remove it should solve the 2 unsatisfied blockers

Sep 03 15:05:47 <flippingBits>	I am setting up a binary package host using ssh. Packaging and deploying all work. It asks me over and over for my password. My ssh key with no password works when I do 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/keyname hostname'. Do I need to tell portage which key to use by default?
Sep 03 15:06:57 <grawity>	how would it know that it needs to use ~/.ssh/keyname
Sep 03 15:07:47 <grknight>	and fetches are done as user "portage" and not you
Sep 03 15:10:24 <flippingBits>	Okay, I can make a key for the portage user. How do I let portage know to use that key?
Sep 03 15:10:41 <flippingBits>	grawity: magic I was hoping, but clearly no lol
Sep 03 15:11:40 <grawity>	either put it at ~portage/.ssh/id_{rsa,ecdsa,ed25519}, or configure its usage at ~portage/.ssh/config
Sep 03 15:11:53 <cosimone>	i have a suggestion to make: when using the gtk frontend with libreoffice, dbus is used to provide the menubar
Sep 03 15:12:03 <cosimone>	in order for this to function correctly, dbus must have X support enabled
Sep 03 15:12:28 <cosimone>	however, libreoffice with the gtk USE flag does not depend on dbus having the X USE flag enabled, resulting in a missing menubar with gtk enabled
Sep 03 15:12:31 <grawity>	eh? regular dbus functionality doesn't involve X
Sep 03 15:12:52 <cosimone>	grawity, this is what i empirically observed on multiple machines
Sep 03 15:13:04 <javashin>	tdr
Sep 03 15:13:09 <javashin>	hi
Sep 03 15:13:18 <cosimone>	if dbus is compiled with -X, libreoffice misses the gtk menubar
Sep 03 15:13:41 <cosimone>	there was an old bug report on the gentoo bugzilla commenting a related, but not entirely similar bug
Sep 03 15:13:48 <javashin>	i fixed my notification problem i dont know what it was but i deleted gui-apps/mako sway and all the python notify stuff
Sep 03 15:13:51 <cosimone>	hold on a second, i'm looking for it
Sep 03 15:14:32 <HuggyBear>	i'd like to install and play around w/Vulkan. Any reason why it can't installed along side virtual/opengl and nvidia-cuda-toolkit?
Sep 03 15:15:04 <grawity>	literally the only thing dbus-daemon uses X for is auto-launch when the session daemon is missing, so
Sep 03 15:15:23 <HuggyBear>	i didn't see any conflicts with emerge -pv
Sep 03 15:15:47 <cosimone>	https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=638012
Sep 03 15:16:36 <cosimone>	grawity, exactly, that's why the problem arises when you don't have a dbus service
Sep 03 15:17:01 <grawity>	then launch a dbus service, you don't need autolaunch for that
Sep 03 15:17:14 <cosimone>	in my opinion, you shouldn't need to
Sep 03 15:17:34 <grawity>	in dbus maintainer's option, as far as I remember, autolaunch is a last-resort feature to make dbus-requiring apps work in a broken session
Sep 03 15:17:49 <HuggyBear>	or virtual/opencl also i guess
Sep 03 15:18:31 <grawity>	(among other things, it's not going to work on pure wayland systems due to being somewhat X11-specific)
Sep 03 15:23:29 <grawity>	cosimone: this is probably an authoritative statement on the status of dbus autolaunch functionality https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2018-November/017640.html
Sep 03 15:27:06 <cosimone>	grawity, uhm... i see, thanks for the link
Sep 03 15:27:52 <grawity>	also, my mistake, dbus-launch --exit-with-x11 also uses libX11
Sep 03 15:29:50 <cosimone>	ok, i see
Sep 03 15:41:59 <xcm>	is there a way to do the fetching of required binaries _at the beginning_ of an emerge, so i can take my binhost and leave before leaving work?
Sep 03 15:45:01 <grknight>	xcm: you can do fetchonly first then redo without
Sep 03 15:45:49 <grknight>	by default, even without fetchonly, all fetching happens in the background after the first one completes even if it does not show a status
Sep 03 15:46:51 <xcm>	grknight: didn't know either of those. thanks a lot
Sep 03 15:47:51 <cihancan>	hi
Sep 03 15:48:06 <twnqx>	grknight: do you know where i'd find the default wget options for emerge?
Sep 03 15:48:40 <twnqx>	i some weird issue with my nfs server i store distfiles on, and keep getting a stale findle handle every few dozen MBs of write if i use wget
Sep 03 15:48:54 <iamben>	portageq envvar FETCHCOMMAND
Sep 03 15:49:04 <cihancan>	grknight: for one week im using xorg-server-9999 how do i know when it gets an update and how do i update to newer git version
Sep 03 15:49:06 <twnqx>	thank you
Sep 03 15:49:14 <iamben>	there's also a RESUMECOMMAND (in case you are applying a tweak, you probably want it both places)
Sep 03 15:49:34 <grknight>	cihancan: that's all on you
Sep 03 15:50:03 <cihancan>	grknight: you mean if i install xorg-server-9999 again it gets the updated version?
Sep 03 15:50:29 <grknight>	cihancan: it will rebuild the package from the VCS if it updated or not
Sep 03 15:51:08 <cihancan>	grknight: do i need to check git page of xorg-server to be heard of updates?
Sep 03 15:51:22 <grknight>	yes
Sep 03 15:51:27 <cihancan>	ok ty
Sep 03 15:54:34 <wokko>	cihancan: You can use 'app-portage/smart-live-rebuild' to check on updates
Sep 03 15:54:39 <cihancan>	grknight: when i try to emerge xorg-server-9999 it says Size of downloads: 0 KiB does that mean it havent got an update?
Sep 03 15:54:54 <grknight>	cihancan: no
Sep 03 15:55:39 <iamben>	the "size of downloads" just calculates from known distfiles/tarballs as recorded in the Manifest files, it doesn't handle VCS upstreams at all
Sep 03 15:55:57 <Necktwi>	i couldn't get my /usr/local/proxy.pac working
Sep 03 15:56:40 <Necktwi>	i use chrome browser; i've set the pac file in gnome settings
Sep 03 15:57:17 <cihancan>	wokko ty
Sep 03 15:57:30 <cihancan>	it downloads xorg-server now
Sep 03 15:57:47 <Necktwi>	pactester reports my pac file as good
Sep 03 15:57:51 <cihancan>	older version was buggy i was trying to find a way to update to newer version
Sep 03 15:58:09 <Necktwi>	i'm trying to connect to tor network
Sep 03 15:58:32 <javashin>	hi
Sep 03 15:58:43 <cihancan>	hi
Sep 03 15:59:28 <javashin>	who can tell me why this polkit-gnome was emerged and pulled by which pkg , because i dont know if i really need it and now emerge --depclean wants to get rid of it
Sep 03 15:59:50 <iamben>	if depclean wants to get rid of it, you don't need it
Sep 03 15:59:58 <javashin>	ok
Sep 03 16:00:01 <cihancan>	javashin: you use systemd?
Sep 03 16:00:03 <wokko>	Necktwi: Test tor connection with proxychains eg 'proxychains -q curl ipinfo.io'
Sep 03 16:00:08 <javashin>	yes
Sep 03 16:00:27 <leio>	polkit[gtk] pulls it; it's not necessary by gnome at least.
Sep 03 16:00:27 <Necktwi>	tor connection works good when i set the proxy manually
Sep 03 16:00:50 <javashin>	thanks
Sep 03 16:00:55 <leio>	(it's just useful for gnome-fallback session in case of GNOME)
Sep 03 16:01:25 <leio>	you don't have any use for polkit-gnome if you use gnome-shell,MATE or Plasma.
Sep 03 16:01:25 <twnqx>	iamben: thanks for the resumecommand pointer, would have forgotten that.
Sep 03 16:01:40 <cihancan>	what do you think after both using 56kbps band and today's 100mbit bands?
Sep 03 16:02:12 <Necktwi>	tor gentoo wiki warns only to use tor browser, should i heed the warning? i'm using chrome
Sep 03 16:02:13 <javashin>	thanks
Sep 03 16:02:23 <javashin>	i have lxde mate xfce and gnome
Sep 03 16:02:51 <cihancan>	grknight: smart-live-rebuild wanted to update xorg-server-9999 package now i need to rebuild xorg modules?
Sep 03 16:04:23 <wokko>	Necktwi: chrome is fine with tor, any browser is but just don't use your browser in fullscreen mode
Sep 03 16:04:34 <iamben>	cihancan: the answer to that is "maybe"
Sep 03 16:04:35 <Necktwi>	ok
Sep 03 16:04:53 <cihancan>	ok
Sep 03 16:04:59 <iamben>	probably not for each and every xorg-server update, but some of them will change the ABI and thus require rebuild of the other modules
Sep 03 16:05:10 <Necktwi>	but how to debug the automatic proxy?
Sep 03 16:05:17 <cihancan>	i see
Sep 03 16:06:13 <Necktwi>	i just used the pac file provided in the tor wiki

Sep 03 17:02:40 <iamben>	the default config has all the standard stuff enabled, configuring a kernel is pretty darn easy as long as you don't get too greedy and disable the normal sane options
Sep 03 17:03:55 <epsilonKNOT>	i'll try out the defconfig

Sep 03 19:38:05 <ccokee>	Hi Im updating from 4 months ago and I've run into a circular dependency http://dpaste.com/2KG4EMG adding that useflag +internal-glib should do the job or is anything else making this cicle?
Sep 03 19:38:30 <iamben>	ccokee: yes, do that.
Sep 03 19:40:01 <ccokee>	iamben: locally?
Sep 03 19:40:53 <iamben>	safest way in general is a package.use entry, but i happen to know that this flag only affects one single package, so you could set it on command-line to be undone later
Sep 03 19:41:27 <ccokee>	thx
Sep 03 19:41:29 <tlhonmey>	ccokee: It only needs it temporarily to get out of the dependency loop, so you could try just tacking USE="internal-glib" right before "emerge" and see if the results are reasonable and then just emerge --changed-use afterward to finish it up.
Sep 03 19:41:53 <iamben>	you wouldn't wanna set it on command-line if it were a more commonly-used flag
Sep 03 19:42:33 <tlhonmey>	Not without making certain that none of the other packages to be upgraded used it anyway.
Sep 03 19:42:53 <tlhonmey>	Which gets to be more trouble than it's worth if there are a lot of them.

Sep 03 20:27:26 <tlhonmey>	Necktwi: that might be worth a feature request then, assuming there's not a better way to do it...  Which there really should be...
Sep 03 20:27:26 <z4ppel>	ccokee: you can find out all installed ebuilds from a specific repo, using equery as follows: equery has repository <repo-name> -F '=$cpv'
Sep 03 20:27:57 <rouking>	grawity: not by iw, which is why I tried wpa_supplicant instead
Sep 03 20:28:13 <iamben>	rouking: are you starting /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant ?
Sep 03 20:28:38 <iamben>	i hope this time it doesn't take 3 hours for a response!
Sep 03 20:28:55 <rouking>	iamben: I'm starting with through the rc-service utility
Sep 03 20:29:21 <rouking>	So, effectively yes
Sep 03 20:29:28 <iamben>	rouking: if your driver requires wpa_supplicant to use -Dwext, then you'll need to specify that via /etc/conf.d/wpa_supplicant
Sep 03 20:29:33 <ccokee>	thx z4ppel... seems that I can survive whitout it
Sep 03 20:29:39 <iamben>	though i think it's rarely a good idea to be using wpa_supplicant directly like this
Sep 03 20:29:42 <Necktwi>	why not ebuilds just follow login.defs? isn't there an option for useradd to add a system user and ebuilds don't use it?
Sep 03 20:29:50 <rouking>	That's what I've done
Sep 03 20:29:59 <iamben>	Necktwi: ebuilds are moving to mandatory fixed UIDs/GIDs
Sep 03 20:30:04 <iamben>	rouking: how did you do that?
Sep 03 20:30:30 <Necktwi>	y?
Sep 03 20:30:33 <rouking>	my wpa_supplicant_args in that file is "-ienp0s20f0u6 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -D wext"
Sep 03 20:30:54 <iamben>	rouking: can you confirm in "ps aux" that it's running with those args?
Sep 03 20:31:18 <rouking>	iamben: yes
Sep 03 20:31:21 <ccokee>	Updated http://dpaste.com/2TAGGFX
Sep 03 20:31:32 <ccokee>	this still not working but seems less tangled
Sep 03 20:31:55 <iamben>	rouking: how are you configuring wpa_supplicant? are you rnetworks defined in wpa_supplicant.conf already?
Sep 03 20:32:07 <iamben>	ccokee: are you still using cross-avr/* ?
Sep 03 20:33:04 <rouking>	No, I was going to use wpa_gui or wpa_cli to scan for the network
Sep 03 20:33:37 <rouking>	I suppose I could grab the info from my laptop instead?
Sep 03 20:34:12 <rouking>	but I feel there's a bigger problem than just scan not working
Sep 03 20:34:17 <grknight>	Necktwi: for the purpose of being consisent across Gentoo (and potentially other distro) machines
Sep 03 20:34:20 <tlhonmey>	ccokee: It looks like you could probably just temporarily remove cracklib and firefox and it might well get most of your updating done at that point.
Sep 03 20:34:36 <iamben>	rouking: does wpa_cli fail?
Sep 03 20:34:40 <rouking>	You'll have to forgive me, as I'm not knowledgeable about wireless
Sep 03 20:34:53 <rouking>	it opens but the scan command fails
Sep 03 20:35:12 <rouking>	with the message <3>CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-FAILED ret=-1
Sep 03 20:35:21 <Necktwi>	aah! don't fix them
Sep 03 20:35:33 <z4ppel>	ccokee: cross-avr/binutils seems to be needed but not available, check with "equery d cross-avr/binutils" to find out which ebuild depends on it. Normally the AVR buildchains should be handled crossdev.
Sep 03 20:35:48 <ccokee>	tlhonmey: mmm thing is I need firefox bc spanish IRS/Hacienda doesn't support chrome as web browser -.-
Sep 03 20:36:05 <iamben>	ccokee: please fix the cross-avr thing, firefox & cracklib are not real problems here.
Sep 03 20:36:07 <ccokee>	z4ppel: Nothing depending on it
Sep 03 20:36:07 <grknight>	Necktwi: it's GLEP 81 so it must be done as maintainers update ebuilds
Sep 03 20:36:10 <ccokee>	removed it yet
Sep 03 20:36:40 <ccokee>	still zlib and libvpx conflicts
Sep 03 20:36:49 <iamben>	those aren't real conflicts, they aren't stopping emerge
Sep 03 20:37:03 <iamben>	it's just saying an upgrade is postponed for those
Sep 03 20:37:26 <iamben>	but maybe worth asking-- why do you get firefox from ROKO__ overlay?
Sep 03 20:37:41 <ROKO__>	:D
Sep 03 20:37:55 <honigkuchen>	why does genkernel not use last kernel config
Sep 03 20:38:08 <ROKO__>	it's same ebuild, added just for comfort
Sep 03 20:38:26 <iamben>	that's rather lame
Sep 03 20:39:46 <grknight>	honigkuchen: it does by default.. genkernel will save sucessful builds to /etc/kernels/ and all rebuilds can read from there.  new versions are unknown unless you use the --kernel-config= option
Sep 03 20:40:00 <tlhonmey>	ccokee: oh...  my bad...  Are you still running emerge with -p?  If so then that's why it's not running your upgrade already.
Sep 03 20:40:23 <ROKO__>	iamben , nope, if you wanna support wide list of gentoo based distros
Sep 03 20:40:41 <iamben>	ROKO__: i don't, though
Sep 03 20:43:22 <ccokee>	tlhonmey: not your fault... mine too for not seeing that
Sep 03 20:43:40 <ccokee>	I was looking around the blocks and saw no major B's
Sep 03 20:44:36 <iamben>	the zlib thing looks like maybe you lost abi_x86_32 on zlib, since last build.  and some of your packages still require it.
Sep 03 20:44:52 <iamben>	so it can't be rebuilt or upgraded, since the new build wouldn't meed requirements
Sep 03 20:45:12 <rouking>	iamben: for reference, if I remove -D wext from the options, this is the output with -dd: http://ix.io/1Ubj
Sep 03 20:45:37 <ROKO__>	i could mask firefox in my repo, specially if installed distro is gentoo.
Sep 03 20:46:02 <iamben>	ROKO__: if your overlay targets another distro, maybe it shouldn't be listed in gentoo's official repo list
Sep 03 20:46:19 <iamben>	rouking: you know about the difference between wext & nl80211 driver modes, right?
Sep 03 20:46:20 <ROKO__>	it targets exactly gentoo
Sep 03 20:46:37 <iamben>	ROKO__: then why does it duplicate firefox::gentoo for no reason?
Sep 03 20:46:47 <rouking>	I know that there *is* a difference, and that for some reason rtl8812au drivers seem to use wext
Sep 03 20:47:04 <Necktwi>	how do i write access nfs shares from macos?
Sep 03 20:47:37 <rouking>	So I'm thinking -D wext is correct, but I just wanted to confirm
Sep 03 20:47:39 <iamben>	rouking: wpa_s can work in either mode via -D... iwconfig/iwlist use only wext, iw uses only nl80211.  it does sound like yours is wext-only.  does scanning via iwlist work?
Sep 03 20:48:04 <tlhonmey>	Necktwi: have you looked at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nfs-utils
Sep 03 20:48:04 <iamben>	test "iw dev wlan0 scan" and the equivalent for iwlist and see which one oworks
Sep 03 20:48:15 <ROKO__>	the plan wasn't to duplicate, but to be -r99 or something, but now is needless.
Sep 03 20:48:44 <Necktwi>	ok
Sep 03 20:48:45 <ccokee>	iamben: I don't excusing ROKO__ but... if a package is listed in the official repo why doesn't emerge take that into account?
Sep 03 20:48:50 <rouking>	What package provides the iwlist command?
Sep 03 20:49:10 <ROKO__>	https://github.com/sandikata/ROKO__/commit/31aafcad142d88e701a7bc99f2c6911921d9901c
Sep 03 20:49:23 <ROKO__>	even there is commit, firefox already removed.
Sep 03 20:49:28 <iamben>	ccokee: portage will prefer the highest visible version from any enabled repo.  if that same highest version exists in both repos, then repo priority takes effect.  by default, gentoo is *lowest* priority.
Sep 03 20:49:33 <z4ppel>	rouking: should be net-wireless/wireless-tools
Sep 03 20:49:38 <Necktwi>	i've set automatice proxy with pac file to access tor network but it won't work. manual proxy SOCKS work though
Sep 03 20:50:00 <ccokee>	iamben: Still think that the official repo should have higer priority
Sep 03 20:50:11 <iamben>	ccokee: you're free to change that, but i suggest using masks instead.
Sep 03 20:50:15 <tlhonmey>	Necktwi: so...  You're trying to NFS from Gentoo to MacOS via Tor?
Sep 03 20:50:26 <Necktwi>	nop
Sep 03 20:50:29 <rouking>	Okay, iw doesn't recognize it while iwlist says it doesn't support scanning
Sep 03 20:50:38 <Necktwi>	tor is different problem
Sep 03 20:50:41 <ccokee>	Hummm interesting then... I didn't know that... I will do
Sep 03 20:50:42 <iamben>	ccokee: even if gentoo/official is highest priority, if roko adds his ebuild at a higher revision # than gentoo's, roko's gets preferred
Sep 03 20:50:46 <tlhonmey>	Ok, just making sure.
Sep 03 20:50:52 <ROKO__>	emaint sync -r ROKO__
Sep 03 20:50:53 <grknight>	rouking: sounds like a broken driver to me
Sep 03 20:50:55 <iamben>	so the "priority" rarely takes effect
Sep 03 20:51:06 <z4ppel>	rouking: or firmware issue
Sep 03 20:51:28 <ccokee>	1663 packages to upgrade... time to walk the dog xD
Sep 03 20:51:36 <ccokee>	bye and thx for all the support :)
Sep 03 20:51:45 <iamben>	rouking: it's possibly you just need to bring the interface UP via ip?
Sep 03 20:51:53 <iamben>	(before scan)
Sep 03 20:52:16 <rouking>	iamben: tried that before, it just stays DOWN
Sep 03 20:53:17 <rouking>	kernel log says "link is not ready"
Sep 03 20:53:50 <iamben>	hmm maybe a broken driver indeed.
Sep 03 20:53:55 <rouking>	Damn
Sep 03 20:54:33 <rouking>	Any recommendations? I am currently using gnab's driver -- https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au
Sep 03 20:54:48 <rouking>	I don't see any open issues indicating that it's totally borked
Sep 03 20:55:44 <iamben>	what kernel version are you building against?
Sep 03 20:55:47 <z4ppel>	rouking: is the driver loaded as a module? if so, unload and reload it, and watch your kernel-log.. maybe ther is something useful..
Sep 03 20:56:14 <rouking>	iamben: 4.19.57
Sep 03 20:58:08 <rouking>	z4ppel: ix.io/1Ubp
Sep 03 20:58:24 <rouking>	that's all the relevant ouput I get
Sep 03 20:59:39 <rouking>	Not sure why it renames wlan0 to enp0s20f0u6
Sep 03 21:00:05 <iamben>	rouking: that's a udev-ism, it can be disabled but it's not too relevant here
Sep 03 21:00:33 <redsh>	Shouldn't wlan0 (a wireless NIC) be renamed wlp*something*?
Sep 03 21:00:48 <z4ppel>	it should.
Sep 03 21:00:52 <iamben>	p stands for pci
Sep 03 21:01:04 <iamben>	oh i misread the part you were talking about
Sep 03 21:01:05 <redsh>	Yes, but I mean the wl prefix.
Sep 03 21:01:26 <iamben>	some attribute in this wifi driver is triggering en* detection, that's not necessarily a problem
Sep 03 21:01:37 <rouking>	Well if the p stands for PCI, that's odd because this is a USB adapter
Sep 03 21:01:50 <rouking>	but I agree, the name shouldn't matter
Sep 03 21:02:25 <z4ppel>	and it's listed in ip? "ip link | grep enp0s20f0u6"
Sep 03 21:02:34 <rouking>	Yep
Sep 03 21:03:03 <iamben>	you can disable teh rename but i dont think it's gonna do much
Sep 03 21:03:22 <rouking>	z4ppel: ix.io/1Ubr
Sep 03 21:03:45 <z4ppel>	.. and "ip link set dev enp0s20f0u6" didn't helped, either?
Sep 03 21:04:25 <rouking>	Nope, it doesn't change anything
Sep 03 21:04:28 <z4ppel>	sorry, missed the "up": "ip link set dev enp0s20f0u6 up"
Sep 03 21:04:36 <rouking>	yeah I was wondering
Sep 03 21:04:57 <rouking>	Anyway someone suggested making sure it wasn't blocked with rfkill but rfkill doesn't even see it
Sep 03 21:05:33 <grknight>	rouking: what's the USB ID on this device.  perhaps there's an alternate driver
Sep 03 21:05:57 <rouking>	USB ID? How would I get that
Sep 03 21:06:06 <grknight>	lsusb
Sep 03 21:06:22 <rouking>	ack, I'll have to download that utility
Sep 03 21:06:44 <grknight>	also possible to list it from /sys i believe
Sep 03 21:06:59 <iamben>	busybox lsusb (won't show descriptions, only IDs)
Sep 03 21:08:48 <rouking>	Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0bda:8812 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8812AU 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2T2R DB WLAN Adapter
Sep 03 21:09:55 <rouking>	The device is a BrosTrend AC3L
Sep 03 21:10:19 <LanDi>	hey guys, trying to run gentoo without issues on my banana pi, yes, the old one... https://www.geany.org/p/U1iSX/ any help?
Sep 03 21:10:35 <rouking>	the "L" means Linux but they just have an install script for Debian derivatives
Sep 03 21:10:45 <rouking>	So I sussed out that the chipset is rtl8812au
Sep 03 21:11:11 <rouking>	and followed the Gentoo wiki and the instructions in gnab's repo
Sep 03 21:11:14 <iamben>	LanDi: this is a new install?
Sep 03 21:11:49 <LanDi>	iamben, it's an old image I've got from the lamaker website, it's pretty old... from 2014
Sep 03 21:12:08 <iamben>	LanDi: that's gonna be quite a lot of work to get up to date, are you a seasoned gentoo user?
Sep 03 21:12:47 <LanDi>	iamben, oh god, I've used gentoo some years ago, I can not remember most of the stuff
Sep 03 21:13:12 <iamben>	well this image is bordering on being too old to be useful
Sep 03 21:13:27 <iamben>	5 years on gentoo is like 30 years on debian
Sep 03 21:13:33 <LanDi>	iamben, once the images from the lamaker website are pretty old, I thought it would be a better idea to try gentoo cause it's rolling
Sep 03 21:13:42 <LanDi>	hahahaha
Sep 03 21:13:43 <tlhonmey>	LanDi: you might be better off to just use that old image to get you something that will boot and then build a fresh system with it...
Sep 03 21:13:49 <iamben>	yeah it rolls too fast for a 2014 image to be useful
Sep 03 21:14:17 <tlhonmey>	You probably *could* update it, but it's going to be less work to just build a new one.
Sep 03 21:14:42 <LanDi>	I see
Sep 03 21:14:50 <tlhonmey>	Since you'll be replacing pretty much everything anyway.
Sep 03 21:15:09 <LanDi>	the process to build a new one in ARM is the same as in other archs?
Sep 03 21:15:32 <rouking>	Yeah, there is a guidebook for it
Sep 03 21:15:40 <rouking>	it being ARM
Sep 03 21:16:16 <LanDi>	ok
Sep 03 21:16:21 <LanDi>	thank you very much
Sep 03 21:16:27 <LanDi>	I will try it
Sep 03 21:17:37 <flippingBits>	LanDi: I would keep a copy of the kernel, make.conf, and fstab from that image. Might help get that first boot off, even if you just use them for a reference.
Sep 03 21:17:56 <LanDi>	flippingBits, that's a good point
Sep 03 21:21:00 <cacoch07>	hi folks, I have issue with my monitor - external and internal. When powersaving shutdown monitor, the only way to wake up external monitor is disconnect and connect again. For internal I din't find workaround.
Sep 03 21:21:36 <z4ppel>	rouking: this might be a cause (1st and 2nd note), https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/AC1200_Wireless_Adapters#Notes
Sep 03 21:25:27 <rouking>	I think I followed those notes when installing, but
Sep 03 21:25:41 <rouking>	*but I have left it plugged in?
Sep 03 21:26:22 <rouking>	What exactly does it mean by the driver being "installed" though? Loading the kernel module?
Sep 03 21:26:54 <rouking>	sorry, I *may* have left it plugged in. My typing is horrible today
Sep 03 21:28:30 <rouking>	Let me run through the process again just to make sure I wasn't being silly
Sep 03 21:28:45 <rouking>	I'll also try csssuf's repo this time instead of gnab's
Sep 03 21:28:45 <z4ppel>	sorry.. -.-
Sep 03 21:29:30 <csssuf>	fwiw i no longer own that device so i haven't even tried to keep that repo up to date
Sep 03 21:29:44 <csssuf>	so your mileage may vary a lot
Sep 03 21:29:56 <rouking>	Are your fixes are merged merged into gnab's?
Sep 03 21:30:10 <rouking>	sheesh my typing really is awful
Sep 03 21:30:18 <rouking>	Are your fixes merged into gnab's repo*
Sep 03 21:31:10 <csssuf>	i think so?
Sep 03 21:31:46 <csssuf>	yeah
Sep 03 21:32:16 <rouking>	Alright then, I will stick with gnab's repo since it seems to be maintained. Thanks for the info
Sep 03 21:32:27 <csssuf>	no problem
Sep 03 21:41:12 <lukelau>	are there openrc keymaps for mac keyboard layouts?
Sep 03 21:41:54 <lukelau>	I saw there was a /usr/share/keymaps/mac folder, but setting my keymap layout in /etc/conf.d/keymaps to “uk-mac” gives messed up bindings
Sep 03 21:42:15 <rouking>	Rebuilt and reinstalled the module, confirming the device was not plugged in during the process
Sep 03 21:42:22 <rouking>	same issue
Sep 03 21:42:39 <lukelau>	speaking of which, is there a way of overriding the keymap at boot since i can’t use the console anymore ahaha
Sep 03 21:42:42 <rouking>	wpa_supplicant will recognize it with -D wext but it fails to scan
Sep 03 21:45:32 <Paradox555555>	I'm getting unknown device type with gentoos netifrc when creating a bridge
Sep 03 21:45:43 <Paradox555555>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Network_bridge
Sep 03 21:45:49 <Paradox555555>	it says bridge-utils isnt needed....... so not sure
Sep 03 21:45:59 <grknight>	bridge-utils is obsolete
Sep 03 21:47:10 <Paradox555555>	so why isnt it working
Sep 03 21:47:12 <Paradox555555>	nothing in dmesg
Sep 03 21:47:39 <grknight>	what part "isn't working"?
Sep 03 21:48:03 <Paradox555555>	it says unknown device
Sep 03 21:48:20 <Paradox555555>	net.br1 start "unknown device type"
Sep 03 21:48:33 <Paradox555555>	same with br0
Sep 03 21:49:17 <grknight>	Paradox555555: does 'modprobe --first-time bridge' succeed?
Sep 03 21:49:37 <Paradox555555>	of course its not in the stupid kernel
Sep 03 21:49:39 <Paradox555555>	i feel like rage quitting
Sep 03 21:51:08 <Paradox555555>	Shouldnt the bridge module be built into all kernels?
Sep 03 21:51:25 <grknight>	no
Sep 03 21:51:26 <Paradox555555>	no idea why thats even optional unless there is some kind of downside
Sep 03 21:51:27 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: there's very little that's built into *all* kernels.
Sep 03 21:51:43 <iamben>	i dont use bridges, why would i want support for that?
Sep 03 21:51:43 <tlhonmey>	Takes more space, so if you'll never use it you might not want it.
Sep 03 21:52:14 <iamben>	in fact i'd say that the vast majority of people don't want or need bridge support
Sep 03 21:52:36 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: if you're coming from another distro and want an easier start, it works perfectly well to grab their kernel config so that all your favorite options are set the way you expect them to be and then customize from there as you care to.
Sep 03 21:53:01 <Paradox555555>	nah ive used gentoo before, just not used to bridges
Sep 03 21:53:08 <Paradox555555>	i actually overlooked it while configuring the kernel so my bad
Sep 03 21:53:29 <grknight>	we all make mistakes

Sep 03 21:55:01 <Paradox555555>	just testing luks with full disk encryption. Not sure why it says there is an active keyfile in the header though since that removes plausible deniability.
Sep 03 21:55:06 <rouking>	If you have all the information about the wireless network, is there some way to get around the scan operation?
Sep 03 21:55:08 <Paradox555555>	oh well
Sep 03 21:55:29 <rouking>	I don't see fields for band and channel etc. in wpa_gui and wpa_cli's help is insanely long
Sep 03 21:56:05 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: Most people are looking more for security and debugability than plausible deniability.
Sep 03 21:56:39 <Paradox555555>	I think if you're opting for full disk encryption you're also looking for plausible deniability.
Sep 03 21:56:46 <Paradox555555>	You can encrypt folders without using full disk encryption
Sep 03 21:57:20 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: nah.  Most of the time I'm looking to make sure that if somebody scampers off with a laptop there's no way for them to extract anything from it.
Sep 03 21:57:43 <Paradox555555>	wouldnt running luks on a partition and then mounting it on a folder achieve the same thing?
Sep 03 21:58:13 <tlhonmey>	No, because then you still have to worry about data leaking into OS logfiles or the swap partition.
Sep 03 21:58:21 <z4ppel>	rouking: maybe, try to disable the interface renaming. (kernel_option: net.ifnames=0)
Sep 03 21:58:28 <Paradox555555>	sure but with a laptop its always powered so you have to worry about ram attacks and stuff
Sep 03 21:59:04 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: It's only always powered if you don't turn it off...  Also, there's a kernel module for that...
Sep 03 21:59:27 <Paradox555555>	doesnt the kernel module significantly degrade performance though
Sep 03 21:59:45 <Paradox555555>	and yeah, im more worried about someone taking the laptop while its powered on in a public setting
Sep 03 21:59:59 <Paradox555555>	and most people just close the lid so it hibernates anyway
Sep 03 22:00:17 <tlhonmey>	No, it's just a killswitch.  If you turn it on without the proper USB device plugged in, or unplug that device while it's running then it wipes the keys off the disk and zeroes the memory until the system dies.
Sep 03 22:01:03 <Paradox555555>	oh
Sep 03 22:01:21 <tlhonmey>	I've seen a couple of different implementations.  Never needed to use one, but it's an option if you need something really secure.
Sep 03 22:01:57 <Paradox555555>	doesnt luks automatically wipe the keys from the disk when shutdown is initiated anyway?
Sep 03 22:02:09 <tlhonmey>	no.
Sep 03 22:02:31 <tlhonmey>	There are two levels.  There's the user password that's used to decrypt the keys, which never gets put on the disk in the first place.
Sep 03 22:02:56 <tlhonmey>	And then the keys themselves which are encrypted with the password and stored in the header because they're large enough that typing them in would be problematic.
Sep 03 22:03:11 <tlhonmey>	You can also put them on an external device that you carry with you if you prefer.
Sep 03 22:03:27 <Paradox555555>	How heavily impacted is your security by keeping them in the header
Sep 03 22:03:28 <tlhonmey>	But they're too big to really be typing in all the time.
Sep 03 22:03:40 <Paradox555555>	especially if you're using a passphrase and key on the user level
Sep 03 22:03:50 <tlhonmey>	It's as strong as your passphrase.
Sep 03 22:03:59 <Paradox555555>	so, passphrase+key = pretty secure
Sep 03 22:04:02 <Paradox555555>	why wipe it at all then
Sep 03 22:04:22 <tlhonmey>	because if you wipe it then even the guy who knows the passphrase and has the keyfile can't unlock it anymore.
Sep 03 22:04:29 <Paradox555555>	sure
Sep 03 22:04:39 <tlhonmey>	So you can't be tortured into giving it up.  It's just gone and forever irretrievable.
Sep 03 22:04:49 <Paradox555555>	but if you store it on the same usb as the user key then it eliminates the point
Sep 03 22:04:54 <Paradox555555>	does it wipe the headers on a clean shutdown?
Sep 03 22:05:20 <redsh>	It can't wipe the headers if you plan on accessing the encrypted storage.
Sep 03 22:05:55 <Paradox555555>	oh right, killswitch
Sep 03 22:05:58 <Paradox555555>	i need coffee
Sep 03 22:05:59 <maffblaster>	Zerb.
Sep 03 22:06:03 <Paradox555555>	wait so
Sep 03 22:06:09 <Paradox555555>	what happens if the usb actually falls out on accident lmao
Sep 03 22:06:13 <Paradox555555>	that would be a big whoops
Sep 03 22:06:26 <tlhonmey>	It's layered encryption.  There's a big key that's stored non-volatile somewhere that's what your massive amount of data is encrypted with.  Because the bigger the key the more data you can encrypt without compromising it.
Sep 03 22:06:46 <tlhonmey>	That key is small enough to be encryptable with a smaller key and/or passphrase.  That's what the user provides to unlock it.
Sep 03 22:07:22 <tlhonmey>	The big key generally never leaves the system except maybe to a secure backup location.
Sep 03 22:07:55 <tlhonmey>	So if you wipe it, poof.  Data's irretrievable until such time as you can brute force a 4096 bit key.
Sep 03 22:08:47 <Paradox555555>	so what if your user keyfile is also 4096
Sep 03 22:08:51 <Paradox555555>	:V
Sep 03 22:09:21 <tlhonmey>	Then that's a bit overkill, but we all know there's no such thing as overkill, there's only "open fire" and "I have to reload".
Sep 03 22:10:12 <tlhonmey>	Regardless, anything that would provide a security benefit to wipe on shutdown the system generally doesn't write to disk in the first place unless it's configured really strangely.
Sep 03 22:10:53 <tlhonmey>	Now, I believe it can be set to zero the RAM on shutdown to make sure there aren't any keys floating in there that might be retrievable for a few minutes.
Sep 03 22:11:22 <tlhonmey>	Which is one of the steps the killswitch modules I've seen can be configured to take.
Sep 03 22:11:58 <tlhonmey>	If you're looking for plausible deniability you might look at stegfs and pingfs...
Sep 03 22:12:15 <Paradox555555>	No I'm not that paranoid
Sep 03 22:12:33 <Paradox555555>	I just think with full disk encryption the goal should be plausible deniability
Sep 03 22:13:35 <tlhonmey>	Plausible deniability at the full disk level requires some capabilities that LUKS doesn't really have.
Sep 03 22:13:56 <tlhonmey>	Truecrypt/Veracrypt do it by having a reserved space that you can't tell if it has a second key in it or not.
Sep 03 22:14:17 <eroen>	Hi! After an unexpected reboot I suddenly don't have keyboard or mouse in X.
Sep 03 22:14:33 <jerichowasahoax>	just in X? tty is okay?
Sep 03 22:14:48 <eroen>	I'm in tty now, keyboard works at least
Sep 03 22:14:59 <iamben>	eroen: wgetpaste /var/log/Xorg.0.log
Sep 03 22:15:02 <eroen>	gpm doesn't want to start for some reason either, but that's not new
Sep 03 22:15:14 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: LUKS doesn't really have a way to do that.  Unless they've added it recently.  It's obvious that there's a LUKS header, but there's only one place a key could be.
Sep 03 22:15:35 <Paradox555555>	Right but the header shows there is a key in slot 0 or whatever its called
Sep 03 22:15:42 <Paradox555555>	iirc there is a way to bypass that but it should be an option by default
Sep 03 22:16:49 <eroen>	iamben: http://dpaste.com/14S2ND4
Sep 03 22:17:57 <iamben>	eroen: is udev started?
Sep 03 22:18:01 <Paradox555555>	iamben using netifrc it shows my hostname as build.unknown_domain. I've modified the net config file and /etc/conf.d/hostname and /etc/hosts, still not fixed.
Sep 03 22:18:39 <iamben>	Paradox555555: "hostname -f" doesnt show the right result?
Sep 03 22:18:52 <eroen>	iamben: it says it is
Sep 03 22:18:54 <Paradox555555>	no address is associated
Sep 03 22:19:18 <iamben>	Paradox555555: can you share your conf.d/hostname and /etc/hosts files?
Sep 03 22:19:19 <eroen>	iamben: or rather openrc says so
Sep 03 22:19:56 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: But it doesn't really have a way to let you use a subchunk of the encrypted partition for a different filesystem without totally wrecking the main filesystem.  Even if you hid the header anyone looking at it is going to say "random numbers on your disk looks like encryption.  Give me the key or else."  For PD you have to be able to hand them a key that only decrypts innocuous stuff.
Sep 03 22:20:01 <iamben>	eroen: so "/etc/init.d/udev status" shows started?
Sep 03 22:20:36 <eroen>	yes
Sep 03 22:21:12 <iamben>	well it's acting like something's broken with udev.  there should be several lines in the xorg log starting "config/udev:" as udev finds various input devices
Sep 03 22:21:34 *	eroen will rebuild eudev
Sep 03 22:22:10 <Paradox555555>	I mean thats way beyond what im looking for as far as protection goes
Sep 03 22:22:19 <Paradox555555>	but I thought even with the PD you're not required to hand over keyfiles or passphrases.
Sep 03 22:23:06 <tlhonmey>	Paradox555555: Anyone who sees a disk full of random noise is likely to assume that it's encrypted and demand access and not be satisfied until they get *something*.
Sep 03 22:23:19 <tlhonmey>	Refusing to give them anything is probably not plausible in most cases.
Sep 03 22:23:54 <tlhonmey>	Hence steganography, which is hiding your data such that they can't even be certain if there's anything there.
Sep 03 22:24:45 <tlhonmey>	And with a properly encrypted device there's no visible difference between a blank area of the disk and a subsection that's encrypted with a different key.  So then you can give them *something* and there's no way for them know if there's anything else there or not.
Sep 03 22:25:07 <Paradox555555>	So truecrypt provides it, but truecrypt also is defunt now
Sep 03 22:25:18 <redsh>	Veracrypt also exists.
Sep 03 22:25:22 <tlhonmey>	Truecrypt has been forked into veracrypt.
Sep 03 22:25:41 <tlhonmey>	Same program, with Windows 10 support and a different logo.
Sep 03 22:27:03 <eroen>	iamben: that didn't do anything. Any suggestions?
Sep 03 22:27:56 <eroen>	iamben: would installing the keybord and mouse drivers be different from trying to use evdev?
Sep 03 22:28:24 <iamben>	eroen: if you wanted to use the keyboard/mouse drivers, you'd have to write specific xorg configs for them
Sep 03 22:28:33 <iamben>	i'd try "/etc/init.d/udev restart" then try starting X again
Sep 03 22:28:34 <eroen>	oh.
Sep 03 22:29:03 <eroen>	tried that a few times no, no noticeable change
Sep 03 22:29:18 <wozencroft>	If it's about the base system, adding sqlite support to python just carried out usually?
Sep 03 22:29:36 <iamben>	is xorg-server still built with USE=udev?
Sep 03 22:30:33 <eroen>	yes, with glamor ipv6 suid udev xnest xorg xvfb
Sep 03 22:30:41 <Paradox555555>	iamben hostname is now correctly displaying information but on boot it still says unknown_device after the hostname
Sep 03 22:30:47 <iamben>	well for some reason xorg & udev aren't talkin'
Sep 03 22:30:49 <Paradox555555>	like cl-01.domain.tld.unknown.device
Sep 03 22:30:50 <Paradox555555>	or something
Sep 03 22:30:52 <Paradox555555>	its weird
Sep 03 22:31:12 <iamben>	Paradox555555: does your /etc/hosts entry use 127.0.0.1 or a real IP address, for this proper FQDN?
Sep 03 22:31:18 <Paradox555555>	127.0.0.1
Sep 03 22:31:36 <iamben>	then i dont know why it wouldn't be resolving properly at the getty login
Sep 03 22:37:01 <disse>	Hey guys, did you ever get checking whether the C compiler works... no ?
Sep 03 22:37:30 <disse>	If I cd to `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/postgresql-11.4/work/postgresql-11.4` where the package was build and invoke the command build.log shows, it works fine...
Sep 03 22:38:16 <iamben>	disse: check config.log (or share it)... probably bad cflags, but it could be something else
Sep 03 22:45:51 <Paradox555555>	lol
Sep 03 22:45:52 <disse>	iamben: http://dpaste.com/1QDMY0G here is the config.log
Sep 03 22:45:57 <Paradox555555>	buildkernel destroyed my usb key
Sep 03 22:46:10 <Paradox555555>	good thing i backed up headers and stuff :V
Sep 03 22:47:02 <iamben>	disse: did you put "ssl" into your CFLAGS by mistake?
Sep 03 22:47:12 <grknight>	disse: you have "ssl" in your CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS.  this is no good
Sep 03 22:47:38 <disse>	ok, I removed it
Sep 03 22:49:40 <disse>	The world update and postgresql installation worked. Thanks guys
Sep 03 22:50:54 <eroen>	good evening grknight! iamben says my udev and xorg aren't talking, you wouldn't happen to have any ideas for amending that would you?
Sep 03 22:51:25 <grknight>	sorry, no
Sep 03 22:51:44 <iamben>	xorg-server has +udev, udev shows started, but zero "config/udev:" stuff in xorg log

Sep 04 10:29:54 <xcm>	hello. i've been using binary packages from another system of mine, but when trying to compile many things, installed dependencies are not found. is there something i need to change with pkg-config for the installed binpkgs to be detected during compilsation?
Sep 04 10:30:52 <xcm>	oh, here we go https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1099440-start-0.html
Sep 04 10:34:48 <xcm>	binhost has been running 17.0, but new host 17.1 D:
Sep 04 11:53:44 <agris>	So I see in the Linux kernel configuration options that there is support for doing various crypto algorithms inside the kernel
Sep 04 11:54:14 <var-g>	Hello, I have AR9271 based USB dongle
Sep 04 11:54:31 <var-g>	it shows up in dmesg and lsusb, but not in ifconfig
Sep 04 11:54:37 <agris>	such as kmod-crypto-sha521 or kmod-crypto-AEAD
Sep 04 11:55:03 <agris>	If this exists why are we using a userspace library such as openssl for crypto operations?
Sep 04 11:55:25 <agris>	is there a reason more programs don't just do crypto with kernel syscalls?
Sep 04 11:55:27 <BtbN>	Because doing pointless context switches to do crypto is pointless.
Sep 04 11:55:48 <agris>	why?
Sep 04 11:55:50 <BtbN>	The in-kernel crypto is used for disk encryption and the like.
Sep 04 11:56:02 <BtbN>	There is no good reason to use it for userland stuff.
Sep 04 11:56:58 <BtbN>	A context switch is one of the most expensive things an application can do. Using syscalls for crypto would sevearly impact performance of the whole system.
Sep 04 11:57:02 <var-g>	I have another pci card that uses ath9k and works fine, but not the usb one... I was wondering if I might have missed something in the kernel configuration or if there's something else
Sep 04 11:57:40 <BtbN>	It would also make it a lot harder to fix issues should they be found in the implementation.
Sep 04 12:01:38 <raiii>	hello, i randomly started having issues with dotnet; to be exact: i play a game called quaver (Quaver/Quaver on github) and i dont remember exactly but im pretty sure just out of nowhere it stopped working properly. it either segfaults at libpango, libgobject, or throws a bunch of critical gobject errors and never runs. tried 2 different branches, all of which i compiled by hand
Sep 04 12:01:53 <raiii>	i tried recompiling all of the above mentioned libraries too and that just made the error vary
Sep 04 12:02:07 <raiii>	im using latest dotnet-core-sdk-bin
Sep 04 12:16:20 <var-g>	everything works now, I believe I was missing ath9k_htc
Sep 04 12:17:50 <sonOfRa>	agris: not to mention that all of them are *configurable*, which means you still need a library layer that checks if the kernel code is available, and if not, fall back to userland implementation, which is another level of indirection making everything even slower.
Sep 04 12:18:08 <agris>	i see
Sep 04 12:18:31 <raiii>	should i just reemerge dotnet
Sep 04 12:25:45 <t4nk-freenode>	wokko, wraeth, iamben; my repo is syncing again... a 'git fetch origin' and 'git pull origin' may have done the trick.. so I managed to avoid clearing my dir, .. it's now fetching rust and firefox (to start with..) though ;)
Sep 04 12:32:03 <twnqx>	if i want to use particular features (namely splitdebug) for some package - do i have to use portage.env?
Sep 04 12:32:23 <raiii>	do you mean a use flag
Sep 04 12:32:27 <raiii>	or what
Sep 04 12:32:37 <twnqx>	FEATURE from make.conf
Sep 04 12:32:42 <raiii>	no clue
Sep 04 12:32:44 <twnqx>	FEATURES* of course
Sep 04 12:33:00 <t4nk-freenode>	yes I think you do, twnqx
Sep 04 12:33:44 <t4nk-freenode>	or if you only want it once you might also trying to prepend it to emerge
Sep 04 12:34:23 <t4nk-freenode>	(I think)
Sep 04 12:36:11 <t4nk-freenode>	euh, twnqx .. you don't.. you add a file to /etc/portage/env/ and then refer to that file from /etc/portage/package.env
Sep 04 12:36:34 <twnqx>	yes, i am aware how that works
Sep 04 12:36:46 <t4nk-freenode>	then why did you ask?
Sep 04 12:37:22 <twnqx>	the question should have been "is there a particular non-common tree to just set features (like with use flags), or do i have to do it via portage.env"
Sep 04 12:37:38 <twnqx>	i mean, you can set USE flags via portage.env, if you want...

Sep 04 13:25:15 <ManDay>	A good day: First time in years back to mesa from portage w/o any X libs!
Sep 04 13:25:51 <ManDay>	Is there anything that one must mind if using "video_cards_iris" instead of "..._intel ..._i965"? I'm having serious performance troubles with it currently.
Sep 04 13:26:21 <Cheaterman>	Hey buddiez I hope y'all doing goodie
Sep 04 13:26:25 <Cheaterman>	I unearthed this: https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-dev/message/f4fd553bb6377a62b3045a86c9880a21
Sep 04 13:26:34 <BtbN>	You should mind that it's a very new and experimental driver and issues are not surprising.
Sep 04 13:27:04 <Cheaterman>	So I did this: https://i.imgur.com/pd2uBNB.png
Sep 04 13:27:25 <Cheaterman>	It's not pixel-perfect yet but it's the closest we have I believe
Sep 04 13:27:34 <Cheaterman>	And I only spent like an hour or two on it
Sep 04 13:27:34 <ManDay>	BtbN: Thanks, fair enough :)
Sep 04 13:28:01 <ManDay>	I thought it might be something like missing blobs or external components which made it drop into S/W or so
Sep 04 13:28:18 <ManDay>	(I just tried it because I spotted it in the use flags and happen to have an iris)
Sep 04 13:28:56 <BtbN>	"Have an iris"?
Sep 04 13:29:11 <BtbN>	Iris is a full rewrite of the pre-Gallium Intel driver. Using Gallium this time.
Sep 04 13:29:16 <ManDay>	a graphics chip dubbed iris?
Sep 04 13:29:20 <ManDay>	oh
Sep 04 13:29:58 <BtbN>	They literally rewrote the whole driver from scratch, and it's very fresh and in active development.
Sep 04 13:29:59 <ManDay>	it seemed reasonable to assume that the "iris" use flag (which in fact replaces i965,intel use flags) was meant for iris chips oO
Sep 04 13:30:10 <BtbN>	What even are Iris chips?
Sep 04 13:30:25 <BtbN>	The Iris driver is for Skylake and up.
Sep 04 13:30:42 <ManDay>	iris 550 is skylake afair
Sep 04 13:31:19 <ManDay>	yes, confirmed
Sep 04 13:31:50 <BtbN>	I don't think it's particularily well tested on anything but Cascade Lake at the moment.
Sep 04 13:32:03 <wokko>	t4nk-freenode: Kool, glad you got it sorted :)
Sep 04 13:41:24 <Cheaterman>	https://i.imgur.com/uftuIqV.png Or this one?
Sep 04 13:41:33 <Cheaterman>	The colors seem closer to the real one
Sep 04 13:41:44 <Cheaterman>	Turns out I had to fiddle with the texture, the one that's given on the wiki is incorrect

Sep 04 13:42:08 <Cheaterman>	https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-src/gentoo-web/blend/metallandscape1.jpg → wrong

Sep 04 14:01:20 <Cheaterman>	If anyone wants to give it a try in 2.8+
Sep 04 14:31:45 <xcm>	i'd like to pass a bunch of packages to emerge (from memory), but have it skip any rebuilds this would cause. how do i go about that?
Sep 04 14:32:21 <grknight>	xcm: not possible.  if you pass an atom on the command-line, it will be built
Sep 04 14:32:51 <xcm>	grknight: i see, thanks. i'll think of doing some filtering beforehand
Sep 04 14:33:11 <xcm>	or pass -k and call it a day
Sep 04 14:34:38 <Polynomial-C>	grknight: what about the --noreplace, -n option?
Sep 04 14:35:06 <Polynomial-C>	Something like "emerge -1n ${packages[@]}" should do the trick.
Sep 04 14:35:55 <grknight>	xcm: Polynomial-C: I've only ever used -n to add to world;  it may or may not produce the expected result
Sep 04 14:36:19 <Polynomial-C>	grknight: -1 avoids the addition to world
Sep 04 14:36:26 <grknight>	indeed
Sep 04 14:36:47 <xcm>	oh i'm not trying to add to world. i'm trying to build only what's missing
Sep 04 14:37:51 <grknight>	that's a very odd statement.  nothing should be "missing" if you install your top level packages
Sep 04 14:52:31 <xcm>	missing as in, not installed. not a missing dependency
Sep 04 14:55:39 <Polynomial-C>	xcm: then these packages should be added to world
Sep 04 14:55:55 <Polynomial-C>	xcm: emerge -n ${packages[@]}
Sep 04 14:57:59 <xcm>	Polynomial-C: the list of packages is mixed. packages that are installed, and packages that are not. i think grknight got it right the first time he answered me
Sep 04 15:01:44 <Polynomial-C>	Okay

Sep 04 15:29:52 <caliel>	good morning #gentoo (ugt)
Sep 04 15:30:21 <caliel>	ERROR: dev-java/netbeans-ide-8.2::gentoo failed (prepare phase): Failed to find xercesImpl.jar in xerces-2
Sep 04 15:30:26 <caliel>	how can I fix this?
Sep 04 15:38:01 <wozencro1t>	Hmm, why do I have sys-devel/bc - is it in base? Just because its should be merged while emerging gentoo-sources
Sep 04 15:39:04 <caliel>	wozencro1t: yes.
Sep 04 15:39:28 <grknight>	wozencro1t: kernel building requires bc
Sep 04 15:39:56 <caliel>	ERROR: dev-java/netbeans-ide-8.2::gentoo failed (prepare phase): Failed to find xercesImpl.jar in xerces-2 <--- anyone could help me, please?
Sep 04 15:40:15 <wozencro1t>	caliel: So it happens basically to every user while emerging gentoo-sources? I mean actually I could live without a calculator, so sys-devel/bc could be removed I suppose
Sep 04 15:40:34 <wozencro1t>	grknight: Ah, ok, thank you. I thought it's just a simple calculator
Sep 04 15:40:39 <caliel>	wozencro1t: read grknight - kernel building *requires* bc - so no, you *need* bc
Sep 04 15:41:11 <redsh>	Unless you're getting binary kernels from somewhere, in which case, you can uninstall gentoo-sources :D
Sep 04 15:41:28 <caliel>	redsh: in which case you can uninstall gentoo :D
Sep 04 15:43:18 <grknight>	caliel: bug 685256 ; note that netbeans-ide is currently scheduled for removal
Sep 04 15:43:20 <willikins>	grknight: https://bugs.gentoo.org/685256 "dev-java/netbeans-ide-8.2-r1 (prepare phase): Failed to find xercesImpl.jar in xerces-2"; Gentoo Linux, Current packages; RESO, OBSO; ascendant512+gentoo:fordfrog
Sep 04 15:43:33 <redsh>	Some other things do depend on bc as well though, I suppose.
Sep 04 15:44:18 <fiesh>	you'd think the kernel could make due with dc..
Sep 04 15:45:09 <caliel>	grknight: thank you
Sep 04 15:45:40 <caliel>	grknight: good alternatives? (for now, I will --depclean 128 packages -.-')
Sep 04 15:46:33 <grknight>	I cannot suggest anything.  I like Netbeans for PHP but it's falling behind on Gentoo.  Bug 685782 really needs to be solved
Sep 04 15:46:35 <willikins>	grknight: https://bugs.gentoo.org/685782 "dev-util/netbeans-11.0 version bump"; Gentoo Linux, Current packages; CONF; StormByte:fordfrog
Sep 04 15:47:24 <wozencro1t>	redsh: Just realized bc is actually a processing language. While reading on the gentoo package site "console based calculator"
Sep 04 15:47:45 <iamben>	fiesh: if they did use dc, we could change gentoo's dep from sys-devel/bc to sys-devel/bc
Sep 04 15:50:02 <redsh>	If you're looking to reduce bloat on your system, then I don't think some tiny calculator that's used by some build systems is the first thing to eliminate :P
Sep 04 15:51:44 <fiesh>	iamben: not really talking about package dependencies here, I know they're basically the same software, developed simultaneously etc.  You'd just think you'd stick to something more basic and sturdy like reverse polish notation than human-like bc syntax ;)
Sep 04 15:52:50 <wozencro1t>	redsh: True, it's more about reading about what is there and for what reason though. So far I had around 190 packages but need some more... :)

Sep 04 16:56:37 <iamben>	of course
Sep 04 16:57:02 <caliel>	I love gentoo - one problem = one new thing learned
Sep 04 16:58:08 <caliel>	Gentoo is the only distro working on my PC though... I don't know what's the problem, but I figure it's the GeForce-950M - I disabled it, just using the Intel one.
Sep 04 16:58:36 <tlhonmey>	Gentoo is often way ahead of most others in terms of hardware support.
Sep 04 16:59:00 <caliel>	even with the system rescue CD (the 5.* based on gentoo not the new one based on ArchLinux) has problems
Sep 04 16:59:04 <grknight>	tlhonmey: except perhaps in odd wireless devices
Sep 04 16:59:07 <caliel>	and the new 6.* can't start lol
Sep 04 16:59:37 <caliel>	can't start at all -.-'
Sep 04 17:01:39 <tlhonmey>	caliel: is your PC old or new?
Sep 04 17:04:16 <caliel>	tlhonmey: 2 years ago
Sep 04 17:04:44 <tlhonmey>	caliel: that should be supported by most major distros at this point I would think, unless it's something esoteric.
Sep 04 17:05:13 <caliel>	tlhonmey: an Asus-X550V
Sep 04 17:05:27 <caliel>	tlhonmey: no, I think this is bugged, some hw issue
Sep 04 17:05:41 <caliel>	tlhonmey: i.e. I've CPU #6 always "stucked"
Sep 04 17:05:56 <tlhonmey>	Yeah, that can happen.
Sep 04 17:05:58 <caliel>	tlhonmey: and the UEFI is f***ed
Sep 04 17:06:16 <tlhonmey>	There are kernel boot parameters to turn off CPUs.  That might get you past the issues.
Sep 04 17:06:29 <caliel>	tlhonmey: I had the boot on a stick with an .efi file - Now I cannot add a boot option lol
Sep 04 17:06:38 <caliel>	so I had to backup my hd and reinstall gentoo
Sep 04 17:06:40 <tlhonmey>	Or you might be able to lower the clock speed and raise the voltage a bit.
Sep 04 17:07:13 <caliel>	tlhonmey: I would need to know how to do it - I am just a simple user who choosed linux over windows, and gentoo over other distros
Sep 04 17:07:31 <caliel>	but i am not an expert user
Sep 04 17:07:47 <caliel>	tlhonmey: but I think the problem is the Nvidia Geforce GTX-950M
Sep 04 17:07:54 <iamben>	i bet some expert here can tell you, but they will use google to find out what to tell you
Sep 04 17:07:59 <iamben>	re: disabling cores
Sep 04 17:08:23 <tlhonmey>	caliel: If you think the card is part of the issue, unplug it and see if the problem goes away.
Sep 04 17:08:45 <caliel>	iamben: :) that would be my lesson for tomorrow - Now thank to you *all* I have a working netbeans to work and pay bills :|
Sep 04 17:09:05 <caliel>	tlhonmey: yes, I did a gentoo install and removed *all* nouveau/nvidia stuff... just intel graphic card
Sep 04 17:09:27 <caliel>	tlhonmey: but think that I tried an Ubuntu Live (last one) - It stucks while loading even in safe graphics :D
Sep 04 17:09:59 <caliel>	tlhonmey: and when I did a genkernel all compilation (this is a manually configured kernel) I had a lot of errors and I could not login :D
Sep 04 17:10:31 <caliel>	so I really think the graphic card is part of the issue - next PC will be a slimbook - do you know it?
Sep 04 17:10:48 <caliel>	read "do you know it" as "what do you think about them"
Sep 04 17:11:34 <caliel>	grknight: thank you very much having helped me for netbeans
Sep 04 17:11:38 <caliel>	iamben: thank you!
Sep 04 17:12:40 <caliel>	just the last question - I did an emerge -uvaDN --with-bdeps=y @world
Sep 04 17:12:47 <caliel>	then I was asked to emerge @revdep-rebuild
Sep 04 17:12:51 <tlhonmey>	caliel: I don't generally waste my time with ultra-thin computers.  For portability stuff I picked up a $25 Acer Chromebook and converted it to Gentoo and log into a desktop remotely when I need power.
Sep 04 17:13:15 <caliel>	I did it, but I still receive the message
Sep 04 17:13:34 <grknight>	caliel: don't forget to do 'emerge -ac' beforehand
Sep 04 17:13:43 <caliel>	http://dpaste.com/2K976FK
Sep 04 17:13:44 <iamben>	@preserved-rebuild may not be able to fix prebuilt binary things
Sep 04 17:13:45 <caliel>	grknight: when?
Sep 04 17:13:56 <grknight>	caliel: after each and every @world
Sep 04 17:13:56 <iamben>	oh, that's not one of them
Sep 04 17:14:28 <caliel>	grknight: I just did it - 0 packages
Sep 04 17:14:47 <caliel>	grknight: still need to emerge @preserved-rebuild
Sep 04 17:14:58 <caliel>	what did I do wrong?
Sep 04 17:15:00 <iamben>	caliel: does "emerge -av @preserved-rebuild" show some packages to build?
Sep 04 17:16:15 <caliel>	caliel: yes, the same :) let me just wgetpaste the output
Sep 04 17:16:32 <iamben>	does it successfully build those packages, or error out?
Sep 04 17:17:10 <caliel>	iamben: http://dpaste.com/2GGW5HE
Sep 04 17:17:15 <caliel>	iamben: successfully build those packages
Sep 04 17:17:44 <iamben>	can you share output of "emerge -pvO pam" ?

Sep 05 10:51:11 <ilmostro>	roboto, noto-cjk; although, you should check out the wiki for configuring fonts.  That's quite a tricky undertaking, imho
Sep 05 10:51:12 <Kelsar>	i am pretty sure noto has emojis... you got all the nice useflags enabled? like icu?

Sep 05 11:06:42 <ilmostro>	yeah, this is weird.  xrandr shows the two displays as XWAYLAND0 and XWAYLAND1.  However, neither redshift nor xrandr makes a difference when trying to change the temperature or gamma color :(

Sep 05 11:33:46 <lg188>	I've been trying to upgrade blender a few times, and I tried to build from source myself.
Sep 05 11:34:04 <lg188>	I noticed it relies on boost 1.65.0 while i have 1.70.0 installed
Sep 05 11:35:10 <lg188>	does anyone know if this is related or just coincidence
Sep 05 11:40:52 <infinmed>	lg188: if it is related? does it explicitly rely on the former or does it rely on it or anything greater than it?
Sep 05 11:41:38 <infinmed>	If it relieds on only it, then it would surely tell you.
Sep 05 11:43:08 <lg188>	It doesn't lock out the depedency but the official build depends on it
Sep 05 11:43:30 <lg188>	so I think the gentoo ebuild might be lacking the restriction
Sep 05 11:44:05 <infinmed>	Well if that is the problem then it would fail during the check or compile of the gentoo version
Sep 05 11:44:52 <lg188>	Blender does fail to compile when boost 1.70.0 is installed
Sep 05 11:45:22 <lg188>	at least on my system and emerge did not protest
Sep 05 11:45:27 <infinmed>	oh
Sep 05 11:46:35 <infinmed>	well if the configure check did not fail but yet the official version checks for it then i would not neccesarily think that is the cause. The gentoo version could be different or patched
Sep 05 11:46:52 <lg188>	that's why I'm informing myself
Sep 05 11:47:10 <lg188>	I'm currently in the process of downgrading boost to see if that resolves the issue
Sep 05 11:48:30 <infinmed>	please do inform
Sep 05 11:48:51 <lg188>	That's why i asked here
Sep 05 11:49:04 <lg188>	I'll delve into the ebuild maybe if it's not the boost version
Sep 05 11:49:16 <infinmed>	I know but you might be taking the only option to the quickest answer

Sep 05 15:04:32 <xcm>	hello. i'm trying to get xorg up on a new machine. i just log in and run `startx`, but i get "Cannot open virtual console 1 (Permission denied)", even though i have followed https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Non_root_Xorg
Sep 05 15:04:56 <grawity>	xcm: do you log in directly as your own user account, or do you log in as root and then `su` to another account?
Sep 05 15:06:31 <xcm>	the latter
Sep 05 15:06:49 <xcm>	since i'm just testing the system
Sep 05 15:06:59 <grawity>	that usually tends to be one of the problems
Sep 05 15:07:41 <grawity>	since /dev/tty# is owned by the person who *logged in*, it doesn't change dynamically based on su
Sep 05 15:07:43 <xcm>	should had been more careful with my "just log in"
Sep 05 15:08:19 <xcm>	i see. i didn't know about that actually, thank you
Sep 05 15:08:21 <grawity>	similarly if you rely on ConsoleKit or systemd-logind to grant input/video device access, that's based on the actual system login
Sep 05 15:10:01 <xcm>	i don't, but since you mention it; so these two basically indirectly allow access to /dev/ttyFoo?
Sep 05 15:12:02 <Cyp_>	After upgrading, Seamonkey crashes soon after startup (after loading some tabs at least) — https://pastebin.com/BuJ09E3q
Sep 05 15:14:10 <grawity>	no, even with them, access to /dev/tty# (local virtual consoles) is assigned based on login
Sep 05 15:14:22 <grawity>	since after all you do log in *directly* to a tty

Sep 05 15:24:53 <honigkuchen>	is it possible with gentoo, when u have an nvidia optimus system, then u have a runlevel with intel for X, and another runlevel without X but usable nvidia optimus, so u can do gpu work with cuda?

Sep 05 15:28:00 <anonymous2ch>	Hi everyone! I get a network unreachable error on dns requests when trying to build latest kubectl. https://pstbin.ru/h/73941/ here is the build log (yes I'm running a local resolever, when using 3rd party resolver the problem persists https://pstbin.ru/h/92472/). When I manually run `make -j8 -j1 -C src/k8s.io/kubernetes WHAT=cmd/kubectl GOFLAGS=-v` in the workdir under the portage user everything
Sep 05 15:28:02 <anonymous2ch>	goes smoothly. I guess the problem is somewhere in chrooting process portage uses. Disabling firewall doesn't help either
Sep 05 15:28:07 <Cheaterman>	It's not pixel-perfect but given we don't have the original texture I'd say it's good enough? :-D
Sep 05 15:28:38 <Sur3>	I think my /etc/eselect/wine/links/wine is wrong...
Sep 05 15:29:11 <anonymous2ch>	Does the portage disable network for itself access prior to building packages for any reason?
Sep 05 15:29:35 <BtbN>	yes
Sep 05 15:30:03 <BtbN>	Network-Access is only allowed during src_unpack, for git ebuilds and the like
Sep 05 15:30:05 <anonymous2ch>	well, then it's a ebuild bug for kubectl, since it fails to build without nework
Sep 05 15:30:36 <anonymous2ch>	is there something particular i can do with ebuild to disable networking disabling? :)
Sep 05 15:30:44 <BtbN>	open a bug
Sep 05 15:30:52 <anonymous2ch>	kk
Sep 05 15:36:04 <Sur3>	ok it seems deleting /etc/eselect/wine/links/wine solved my eselect problem
Sep 05 15:44:04 <Cyp_>	This link seems to insta-crash www-client/seamonkey-2.49.5, but worked fine in www-client/seamonkey-2.49.9.1_p0 — https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/feeding-a-physical-based-lighting-mode/
Sep 05 15:44:11 <Cyp_>	Does it crash for everyone or just for me?
Sep 05 15:45:10 <Cyp_>	(Note that 2.49.5 is the newest version, newer than 2.49.9.1_p0 somehow.)
Sep 05 15:45:21 <anonymous2ch>	https://bugs.gentoo.org/693548
Sep 05 15:46:01 <anonymous2ch>	Ok, so now bug is submitted is there anything I can do locally to make the package build?
Sep 05 15:46:13 <BtbN>	It's go... Yeah, go is pretty much not packagable in any sensible way to do wanting to download its deps itself
Sep 05 15:46:33 <anonymous2ch>	sys-cluster/kubectl-1.14.6 build just fine btw
Sep 05 15:47:05 <BtbN>	Hm, does Seamonkey really only get updates every like 6 months? That seems super bad to use as a browser.
Sep 05 15:47:20 <BtbN>	Scrolling over their news page does not look promising.
Sep 05 15:52:04 <anonymous2ch>	I guess we should add dev-go/systemstat package which kubectl depends now https://bitbucket.org/bertimus9/systemstat but it doesn't even have any release version
Sep 05 15:52:24 <anonymous2ch>	stupid go
Sep 05 15:52:42 <grknight>	anonymous2ch: yes that's a common problem with go.. software doesn't create releases so it's hard to depend on
Sep 05 15:53:02 <anonymous2ch>	how does it even work if everyone has different code in dependent libs
Sep 05 15:53:49 <satmd>	API compatibility
Sep 05 15:53:51 <dominik_>	Hey
Sep 05 15:54:38 <grknight>	go software often depends on a certain checkout because git is king and releases are old school ;)  just hope you never need any stability or bugfixes
Sep 05 15:55:17 <satmd>	and all packages need the SAME checkout
Sep 05 15:55:33 <anonymous2ch>	and home for the right moon cycle when installing programs, so you won't get a buggy dependance code?
Sep 05 15:55:44 <BtbN>	including a github repo is literally a language feature in go
Sep 05 15:55:44 <anonymous2ch>	hope*
Sep 05 15:55:49 <BtbN>	it's the worst trash
Sep 05 15:56:11 <dominik_>	Which programming languages do you use primarly?
Sep 05 15:56:17 <BtbN>	Not Go
Sep 05 15:57:07 <anonymous2ch>	actually I see they actyally specify commit they want https://proxy.golang.org/bitbucket.org/bertimus9/systemstat/@v/v0.0.0-20180207000608-0eeff89b0690.mod is https://bitbucket.org/bertimus9/systemstat/commits/0eeff89b0690611fc32e21f0cd2e4434abf8fe53
Sep 05 15:57:19 <anonymous2ch>	I guess it is fixable after all
Sep 05 15:57:28 <anonymous2ch>	just need to download that beforehand
Sep 05 15:57:41 <BtbN>	It'll probably still want to talk to that server
Sep 05 15:57:48 <BtbN>	so you'll have to somehow patch it not to
Sep 05 15:58:34 <anonymous2ch>	or make portage support commit hash as version number
Sep 05 15:59:50 <grknight>	anonymous2ch: technically, the original link could be 0_pre20180207000608  as a valid version;)
Sep 05 16:00:11 <dominik_>	:q!
Sep 05 16:36:05 <HuggyBear>	is anyone using unigine Valley or Heaven for GPU benchmarking and having trouble/or success getting the csv logs/reports saved?

Sep 05 17:29:19 <Hund>	honigkuchen: More colours on what?
Sep 05 17:29:44 <honigkuchen>	text mode
Sep 05 17:30:08 <grawity>	the default Linux console doesn't support more than 2*8 for text
Sep 05 17:30:09 <anonymous2ch>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA-compatible_text_mode only supports 16 colors. You'll need some graphic drivers on kernel level
Sep 05 17:30:25 <grawity>	regardless of whether it's in VGA text mode or framebuffer mode
Sep 05 17:30:31 <honigkuchen>	<anonymous2ch> how
Sep 05 17:30:42 <grawity>	although IIRC that was indeed one of the reasons they didn't want to add full-color support
Sep 05 17:31:21 <iamben>	you can get full color support with the right kmscon+libtsm combo but honestly you should just start X
Sep 05 17:31:40 <iamben>	it's better than your console-only setup in every way, if we're honest

Sep 06 08:15:16 <wokko>	cihancan: yes use 17.1 if it is a newish stage3
Sep 06 08:15:38 <wraeth>	nixdork: In short, when you're looking for a file, navigate the tree to where it was (or as close to there as you can), view the commit log at that point, look for a commit that you think removes the file(s) you want and, if it does, click on its parent commit and browse the tree from there. As for what version of a file, typically patches don't change that much, but you can browse the tree at that commit to see if your ebuild is there using that
Sep 06 08:15:38 <wraeth>	patch; or just grab the last one before it was removed.

Sep 06 08:20:49 <Kangie>	that it will. Go get a coffee. :)
Sep 06 08:20:53 <wokko>	cihancan: see ya around christmas time :)
Sep 06 08:20:55 <ricks_>	^
Sep 06 08:21:09 <Kangie>	ricks_, did you have any success with your glibc?
Sep 06 08:21:12 <nixdork>	wraeth: Ok so I found 2.25 at https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/sys-libs/glibc/files?id=f19183bc309b95544515109f736a8d4d35ca0472
Sep 06 08:21:28 <nixdork>	and I can go to the tree and get https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sys-libs/glibc/files?id=f19183bc309b95544515109f736a8d4d35ca0472
Sep 06 08:21:57 <ricks_>	Kangie, yup ^^ disabled nearly all the flags except caps and it went through
Sep 06 08:22:02 <nixdork>	but if I go to the 2.20 directory to get the file it's at https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sys-libs/glibc/files/2.20?id=f19183bc309b95544515109f736a8d4d35ca0472
Sep 06 08:22:02 <Kangie>	ah nice.
Sep 06 08:22:26 <ricks_>	i've binned it and cp'd it to root; now time to test out the patches again hahaha
Sep 06 08:22:49 <wokko>	ricks_: might've go away with just reinstalling util-linux with glibc at the same time ???
Sep 06 08:23:08 <nixdork>	wraeth: but that file looks like it's for 2.20 not 2.25.
Sep 06 08:23:33 <wraeth>	nixdork: I'm not sure I understand the question...
Sep 06 08:23:49 <wraeth>	Rather, I'm fairly sure I don't. :)
Sep 06 08:23:55 <ricks_>	wokko, possibly...i hadn't thought of that actually
Sep 06 08:23:58 <nixdork>	I don't either. :/
Sep 06 08:24:01 <wraeth>	Heh
Sep 06 08:24:23 <nixdork>	I guess /var/tmp/portage/sys-libs/glibc-2.25-r11/files/2.20/glibc-2.20-gentoo-stack_chk_fail.c means it's the .c file from 2.20 but it's still being used in 2.25?
Sep 06 08:25:13 <wraeth>	nixdork: That's plausible - no point distributing multiple copies of the patch just ebcause the version number changed, and a patch could be relevant for many versions - until the patch is accepted upstream or otherwise no longer relevant to apply.
Sep 06 08:25:58 <wraeth>	nixdork: Check the ebuild to see exactly what path it's referencing the patch at.
Sep 06 08:28:20 <Kangie>	yeah
Sep 06 08:28:24 <Kangie>	nixdork, they're looking for
Sep 06 08:28:33 <Kangie>			cp "${FILESDIR}"/2.20/glibc-2.20-gentoo-stack_chk_fail.c debug/stack_chk_fail.c || die
Sep 06 08:28:34 <Kangie>			cp "${FILESDIR}"/2.20/glibc-2.20-gentoo-chk_fail.c debug/chk_fail.c || die
Sep 06 08:28:45 <nixdork>	Also glibc-2.25-gentoo-chk_fail.c
Sep 06 08:28:55 <nixdork>	I just found that in the ebuild.
Sep 06 08:29:00 <nixdork>	It's missing.
Sep 06 08:29:06 <Kangie>	the file?
Sep 06 08:29:21 <nixdork>	Yeah.
Sep 06 08:29:21 <Kangie>	I see both of them there
Sep 06 08:29:28 <Kangie>	https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sys-libs/glibc/files/2.20?id=f19183bc309b95544515109f736a8d4d35ca0472
Sep 06 08:31:05 <nixdork>	Your link is from 2.20 tho.
Sep 06 08:31:11 <nixdork>	https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sys-libs/glibc/files/2.25?id=910b42a909907ecfe68366fe31d5652765e0969d
Sep 06 08:32:22 <Kangie>	nixdork, if you go a couple levels up the source tree, you'll see the 2.25 ebuild is there in that commit
Sep 06 08:32:25 <Kangie>	tbh it's not r-11 though
Sep 06 08:32:43 <Kangie>	your commit isn't r-11 either...
Sep 06 08:33:11 <Kangie>	ah, because they moved it in r-1 to /2.25
Sep 06 08:33:26 <Kangie>	https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/sys-libs/glibc/files/2.25?id=910b42a909907ecfe68366fe31d5652765e0969d
Sep 06 08:33:34 <Kangie>	I'll be offline for a few.
Sep 06 08:44:54 <nixdork>	OMG
Sep 06 08:45:21 <nixdork>	It worked for almost 10 minutes then it blew up with so many error messages.
Sep 06 08:45:57 <wraeth>	That's progress. Now to start working on that blow-up. :)
Sep 06 08:46:03 <nixdork>	# wc -l /var/tmp/portage/sys-libs/glibc-2.25-r11/temp/build.log
Sep 06 08:46:03 <nixdork>	16095 /var/tmp/portage/sys-libs/glibc-2.25-r11/temp/build.log
Sep 06 08:46:20 <nixdork>	I think I sprained my terminal.
Sep 06 08:46:55 <wraeth>	Heh
Sep 06 08:46:57 <nixdork>	I haven't seen that much spam since I tried to cat /vmlinuz.
Sep 06 08:47:41 <nixdork>	 /usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory
Sep 06 08:49:21 <nixdork>	It must be trying to compile multilib I guess.
Sep 06 08:51:53 <nixdork>	[ebuild     U #] sys-libs/glibc-2.25-r11 [2.22-r4] USE="(multilib*) rpc%* -audit% -caps% -headers-only%"
Sep 06 08:52:15 <Kangie>	nixdork, are you on a multilib profile?
Sep 06 08:52:33 <nixdork>	But I put -multilib in package.use for sys-libs/glibc
Sep 06 08:52:39 <nixdork>	I didn't think so but now I'm not sure.
Sep 06 08:52:49 <wraeth>	eselect profile show
Sep 06 08:53:35 <cihancan>	wokko: cya
Sep 06 08:53:40 <nixdork>	I messed up. :(
Sep 06 08:53:57 <Kangie>	are you on a multilib profile now, and you started from no-multilib?
Sep 06 08:54:03 <nixdork>	I had an out of date profile and I updated to the wrong one.
Sep 06 08:54:12 <nixdork>	Right.
Sep 06 08:54:31 <Kangie>	just update your profile to no-multilib and see how it goes.
Sep 06 08:54:31 <wraeth>	Moving from multilib->nomultilib isn't hard; moving from nomultilib->multilib is.
Sep 06 08:54:45 <Kangie>	if it wasn't multilib in the first place, hopefully it'll just work.
Sep 06 08:55:50 <nixdork>	Well I already said yolo right?
Sep 06 08:56:07 <wraeth>	And I've cringed every time you have. ;)
Sep 06 08:56:15 <Kangie>	pretty much. It sounds like you're getting closer to getting gentoo going on that stupidly old openvz kernel. :P
Sep 06 08:56:27 <nixdork>	If I have to nuke this vm and start over I am going to scream so much.
Sep 06 08:56:50 <wraeth>	If you do, at least you'll have the experience gained from all the messing about so far. :)
Sep 06 08:56:54 <Kangie>	nixdork, just backup your local repo stuff, and whatever glibc stuff you've done to the local repo
Sep 06 08:57:07 <Kangie>	so at worst you're starting from that outdated stage3 but can get portage & glibc done. ;P
Sep 06 08:57:29 <cihancan>	emerging sys-devel/llvm-7.1.0
Sep 06 08:58:16 <Kangie>	it'll get there cihancan.
Sep 06 08:58:43 <cihancan>	i hope :)
Sep 06 08:59:06 <Kangie>	I recently rebuilt my laptop on gentoo, and it's only a Intel i5-6200U (4) @ 2.800GHz with 4GB RAM
Sep 06 08:59:15 <Kangie>	llvm got there in the end.
Sep 06 09:00:20 <cihancan>	Kangie: it is like my older laptop i used gentoo on it 3 years
Sep 06 09:01:51 <cihancan>	it had 5200u which topped 103C on load
Sep 06 09:01:51 <cihancan>	it didnt burn my house
Sep 06 09:03:19 <nixdork>	I need to thank all you guys who have been helping me on this insane quest.
Sep 06 09:03:28 <generic>	cihancan it's really a shame have you tried cpupower?
Sep 06 09:03:43 <cihancan>	generic: no i didnt
Sep 06 09:03:47 <nixdork>	I have a killer headache now but at least glibc is compiling and it might actually finish this time.
Sep 06 09:04:19 <cihancan>	103C not that high for silicon man
Sep 06 09:04:23 <Kangie>	generic, oh yeah. I should probably setup a
Sep 06 09:04:32 <Kangie>	power management for cpu thing.
Sep 06 09:04:36 <cihancan>	it still in spec
Sep 06 09:04:44 <Kangie>	cihancan, that's the max.
Sep 06 09:04:50 <Kangie>	The CPU will throttle once it hits 100C
Sep 06 09:05:01 <generic>	cihancan: wouldn't expect too much from it because most chips have minimum frequencies of 1000mhz
Sep 06 09:05:42 <nixdork>	OMG it worked!
Sep 06 09:05:45 <nixdork>	>>> Jobs: 1 of 1 complete                           Load avg: 3.81, 3.86, 2.57
Sep 06 09:06:01 <nixdork>	I almost can't believe it.
Sep 06 09:06:04 <Kangie>	haha, so now you can rebuild your toolchain & hopefully things will do their stuff?
Sep 06 09:07:00 <nixdork>	Yeah I think maybe I should emerge --rebuild-everything-I-just-upgraded to hopefully clean up the multilib screwup.
Sep 06 09:07:38 <generic>	I really need a way to keep mixer levels from being changed
Sep 06 09:07:53 <Kangie>	nixdork, maybe changed-use will pick up the multilib flag?
Sep 06 09:07:58 <Kangie>	save you a few rebuilds.
Sep 06 09:08:13 <generic>	now madplay is changing my mixer levels
Sep 06 09:10:03 <nixdork>	# man emerge
Sep 06 09:10:03 <nixdork>	could not launch PAGER: No such file or directory
Sep 06 09:10:08 <nixdork>	LOLLLL
Sep 06 09:10:38 <wraeth>	Set $PAGER to something that exists, more or less. ^.^
Sep 06 09:11:52 <xcm>	hello. i need some help with certain build failures. gtk+-2.24.32 fails because it can't find libfribidi. build.log: http://dpaste.com/2J9Y7F4 , emerge --info: http://dpaste.com/3XAFE80
Sep 06 09:12:24 <nixdork>	wraeth: But less is already there and works.
Sep 06 09:12:41 <wraeth>	nixdork: Is that what $PAGER is set to?
Sep 06 09:12:53 <nixdork>	Speak the yolo, suffer like a cholo.
Sep 06 09:13:08 <nixdork>	less
Sep 06 09:13:09 <wraeth>	nixdork: Because that error looks like it's trying to run something called "PAGER"
Sep 06 09:13:39 <nixdork>	I probably need to reboot but I won't be surprised if the vm never boots again.
Sep 06 09:13:49 <generic>	xcm: try making a symbolic link
Sep 06 09:14:12 <generic>	xcm: to the libfribidi version you have
Sep 06 09:14:45 <wraeth>	nixdork: Try 'PAGER=less man emerge'
Sep 06 09:14:53 <xcm>	generic: the one i have installed already provides /usr/lib32/libfribidi.so.0 and /usr/lib64/libfribidi.so.0
Sep 06 09:15:07 <nixdork>	Isn't there a flag for forcing a rebuild of existing packages?
Sep 06 09:15:36 <wraeth>	nixdork: emerge builds what you tell it to build (dep tree depending)
Sep 06 09:16:46 <generic>	xcm: ln -s /usr/lib/libfribidi.so.version /usr/lib/libfribidi.0
Sep 06 09:17:35 <xcm>	generic: right. i'll try `revdep-rebuild --library /usr/lib64/libfribidi.so.0` first and then that
Sep 06 09:17:48 <nixdork>	wraeth: I told it to do a bunch of packages in a loop and most of them were like this: These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:
Sep 06 09:17:57 <nixdork>	Calculating dependencies... done!
Sep 06 09:18:01 <nixdork>	So they got skipped.
Sep 06 09:18:31 <generic>	xcm: or maybe a libtool doesn't find the paths
Sep 06 09:18:43 <nixdork>	I guess I need to leave out all the options like -D and stuff.
Sep 06 09:19:48 <wraeth>	nixdork: I'm not sure what you mean. Full command and output into a paste service would help; but I'm also just about to lave.
Sep 06 09:19:51 <wraeth>	Leave, even.
Sep 06 09:21:29 <Kangie>	heh. 40 mins for me. :(
Sep 06 09:21:31 <xcm>	while i let that execute.. fftw fails with "compiling simd-avx2.h without avx2 support". `cpuid2cpuflags` says the cpu supports avx2 and i have set its output in make.conf. build.log: http://dpaste.com/0E4S00J
Sep 06 09:21:45 <Kangie>	what's your CPU xcm?
Sep 06 09:21:56 <xcm>	Kangie: i5-4210U
Sep 06 09:22:43 <Kangie>	yeah, apparently it has avx2.
Sep 06 09:23:48 <Kangie>	xcm, what're you compiling?
Sep 06 09:24:30 <xcm>	Kangie: sci-libs/fftw-3.3.6_p2
Sep 06 09:25:00 <nixdork>	wraeth: I was doing emerge --newuse which was dumb.
Sep 06 09:25:01 <nixdork>	Thanks for all your help tho.
Sep 06 09:25:01 <nixdork>	I think I'm going to let this thing build as many packages as it can and see what happens overnight.
Sep 06 09:25:18 <Kangie>	Fair enough. have a good night nixdork.
Sep 06 09:25:35 <wraeth>	nixdork: Not dumb; excessive, perhaps, but not dumb.
Sep 06 09:25:48 <nixdork>	Thank you too Kangie.
Sep 06 09:26:06 <Kangie>	xcm, what CPU flags do you have set in your make.conf?
Sep 06 09:26:26 <xcm>	Kangie: emerge --info: http://dpaste.com/3XAFE80
Sep 06 09:27:02 <Kangie>	yeah, OK, AVX2 is enabled there, too.
Sep 06 09:27:17 <xcm>	i'll temporarily remove avx2 from it and see what happens. although i suspect it is not the culprit
Sep 06 09:27:52 <xcm>	should had pasted emerge -v, sorry about that. but yes, it was +avx2
Sep 06 09:28:12 <Kangie>	xcm, what's the output of equery u sci-libs/fftw?
Sep 06 09:28:28 <Kangie>	but yeah, if you turn avx2 off it will probably compile.
Sep 06 09:29:31 <xcm>	Kangie: http://dpaste.com/39BDDXD
Sep 06 09:30:22 <Kangie>	avx2 is disabled there - did you disable it manually already?
Sep 06 09:32:52 <xcm>	Kangie: yes, that's why it's disabled in the paste
Sep 06 09:34:18 <Kangie>	ok. No idea xcm. You could try emerging another package that uses avx2 and see if that works. There's a few reports in the forum in german and italian from a couple years ago, but they didn't really find a solution.
Sep 06 09:35:17 <xcm>	Kangie: thanks for looking into it. it's compiling for now, let's see if it finishes
Sep 06 09:35:31 <xcm>	generic: unfortunately symlinking libfribidi didn't work
Sep 06 09:36:07 <xcm>	generic: oh, i'll have to try again. it seems to be looking for the 32bit version of it instead
Sep 06 09:37:11 <xcm>	i don't even need abi_x86_32 on this particular machine. i'm making my life difficult for no reason
Sep 06 09:41:15 <xcm>	Kangie: it worked with avx2 disabled :)
Sep 06 09:41:41 <Kangie>	xcm, weird that avx2 wasn't passed properly.
Sep 06 09:43:23 <Kangie>	xcm, looks like an upstream bug
Sep 06 09:48:53 <Kangie>	hey xcm, any reason you're using march=x86_64 and mtune instead of march=native?
Sep 06 09:49:20 <Kangie>	'cause I'm apparently successfully compiling fftw with avx2 now.
Sep 06 09:49:56 <xcm>	Kangie: because i want everything to work if my hardware catches fire tonight and i have to switch to different hardware
Sep 06 09:50:10 <xcm>	(also because i'm lazy and binhost)
Sep 06 09:50:26 <Kangie>	fair enough.
Sep 06 09:51:52 <xcm>	i just cloned this entire config from my other box, on which fftw must have at some point compiled successfuly :/ perhaps some newer combination of deps?
Sep 06 09:56:47 <Kangie>	xcm, I'm leaning towards it being a side effect of your march & mtune atm.
Sep 06 09:56:50 <Kangie>	ie
Sep 06 09:56:58 <Kangie>	march=generic doesn't have avx2
Sep 06 09:57:05 <Kangie>	but mtune does
Sep 06 09:57:11 <Kangie>	so it gets confused
Sep 06 09:57:41 <Kangie>	I reckon if you set march=native, mtune=broadwell
Sep 06 09:57:49 <Kangie>	haswell sorry
Sep 06 09:57:55 <Kangie>	it'd work just fine.
Sep 06 09:58:06 <Kangie>	or alternately just march=native
Sep 06 09:59:04 <xcm>	Kangie: oh that could make sense
Sep 06 09:59:35 <Kangie>	I reckon it'd solve the issue for you. Feel free to give it a go. I'll be offline for an hour but I'm interested to see if this fixes your issue.
Sep 06 09:59:45 <Kangie>	seems like GCC gets a bit confused about processor features in that particular combination.
Sep 06 10:01:47 <Kangie>	anyway, I'm outta here. Will pop back in around an hour to see if it helped, xcm. I'd certainly be interested in knowing if march=native fixes that package. :)
Sep 06 10:01:50 <xcm>	Kangie: actually, on both machines the output of `gcc -v -E -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null -mtune=native 2>&1 | grep /cc1 | grep -o -- '--param .*'` is the same (save for cache size)
Sep 06 10:02:22 <xcm>	Kangie: alright, i'll let you know if i have time to try it out
Sep 06 10:03:02 <Kangie>	cheers. :)
Sep 06 10:13:28 <ricks_>	Is there anything wrong with globally masking static-libs? Unsure if I'm introducing silent errors, there are a couple packages that warn about missing .la files but seem to work otherwise
Sep 06 10:13:50 <Kelsar>	ricks_: those are usually used for initramfs
Sep 06 10:15:34 <ricks_>	Kelsar, ah yes, I've read about that. I only need busybox for a proper initramfs, right? It's actually working now (no-multilib profile with sysd), except cryptsetup is broken, so I've unmasked busybox only
Sep 06 10:16:09 <Kelsar>	ricks_: if you need cryptsetup in your initramds, you will need static-libs for that
Sep 06 10:17:15 <ricks_>	Alright, I'll look into that, thank you
Sep 06 10:43:27 <generic>	im looking for a method to freeze alsa mixer levels. can I change /dev/mixer permissions so only root can access them somehow?
Sep 06 10:56:03 <Kangie>	xcm, any luck?
Sep 06 10:56:39 <xcm>	Kangie: i'm working on getting the rest of the system in shape for now, but i'll eventually get to it
Sep 06 10:57:04 <Kangie>	nah, all good. It's to sate my curiousity more than anything else. :)
Sep 06 10:58:27 <cihancan>	guys i have another problem looks like emerge`s installation phase takes too long much longer than usual
Sep 06 10:58:43 <cihancan>	it builds fast but takes too much time at installation phase
Sep 06 10:59:17 <cihancan>	what could be the problem?
Sep 06 11:00:00 <Kangie>	hm.
Sep 06 11:00:02 <Kangie>	Disk IO?
Sep 06 11:00:16 <cihancan>	i cant see it really there is no hdd light on my laptop
Sep 06 11:00:25 <cihancan>	load avg pretty low
Sep 06 11:00:52 <Xelnor>	cihancan: on specific packages?
Sep 06 11:00:56 <cihancan>	on all
Sep 06 11:01:04 <Kangie>	cihancan, try emerging iotop
Sep 06 11:01:05 <cihancan>	so stupid bug
Sep 06 11:02:17 <cihancan>	it built it but im waiting for it to install
Sep 06 11:02:18 <Kangie>	once you've done that, do some IO things on the disk. See if it plateaus on the install, go from there.
Sep 06 11:03:09 <cihancan>	why gentoo is so buggy
Sep 06 11:03:16 <cihancan>	it wasnt before
Sep 06 11:03:21 <cihancan>	i used it for years
Sep 06 11:03:30 <Kangie>	cihancan, It hasn't gotten any more buggy in the last 5-6 years.
Sep 06 11:03:35 <cihancan>	because of another bug i needed to reinstall gentoo
Sep 06 11:03:41 <Kangie>	are you on an ssd?
Sep 06 11:03:43 <Kangie>	what bug was that?
Sep 06 11:03:45 <cihancan>	now i cant install it
Sep 06 11:04:03 <cihancan>	sec
Sep 06 11:04:22 <Kangie>	also, one more thing to do. Try cd /usr/src
Sep 06 11:04:23 <Kangie>	then
Sep 06 11:04:30 <Kangie>	rsync -av linux copy

Sep 06 11:05:43 <cihancan>	not gentoo one
Sep 06 11:05:45 <Kangie>	you could have unmerged etc.
Sep 06 11:05:50 <Kangie>	but anyway
Sep 06 11:05:53 <Kangie>	how did that rsync go?
Sep 06 11:06:20 <cihancan>	it gone well no errors
Sep 06 11:06:31 <Kangie>	went pretty quick?
Sep 06 11:06:37 <cihancan>	yes
Sep 06 11:07:00 <cihancan>	ive rebooted rechroot
Sep 06 11:07:06 <cihancan>	but it didnt fix the problem
Sep 06 11:07:11 <cihancan>	somehow emerge installs so slow
Sep 06 11:07:18 <cihancan>	it feels like a bug to me
Sep 06 11:07:19 <Kangie>	emaint --fix cleanconfmem
Sep 06 11:07:20 <Kangie>	?
Sep 06 11:08:02 <Kelsar>	cihancan: it just calls "cp", so check your io with iostat or dstat
Sep 06 11:08:32 <Kangie>	he's waiting for it to 'install' now.
Sep 06 11:08:33 <cihancan>	disk io is 7kb
Sep 06 11:08:49 <Kangie>	we also copied the kernel sources with rsync, and it went pretty quickly.
Sep 06 11:09:01 <Kelsar>	cihancan: while it is doing someting, if it stays there, you got a problem
Sep 06 11:09:19 <Kangie>	can you delete the copy we made, and rsync again while watching io?
Sep 06 11:09:24 <Kelsar>	cihancan: ssd hdd? which filesystem?
Sep 06 11:09:26 <cihancan>	disk io is only 3-15 kb no any other actions
Sep 06 11:09:35 <cihancan>	ext4 on a mechanical harddik
Sep 06 11:10:06 <Kelsar>	slow is relative
Sep 06 11:10:19 <Xelnor>	cihancan: chroot <== so you're running from another system? which distribution?
Sep 06 11:10:27 <cihancan>	mint
Sep 06 11:11:07 <cihancan>	it was working normally 10 mins ago
Sep 06 11:11:23 <Xelnor>	and how "slow" are we talking about? maybe try adding `keeptemp` to FEATURES in /etc/portage/make.conf and examine the logs (/var/tmp/portage/<cat>/<atom>/temp/build.log) to see which steps seem to be slow?
Sep 06 11:11:32 <cihancan>	its not the distribution im sure ive installed gentoo 2 times using this same distribution
Sep 06 11:11:41 <cihancan>	i guess ill reformat this
Sep 06 11:11:45 <cihancan>	and try again
Sep 06 11:12:00 <Kangie>	cihancan, that will probably solve your problem, but it's likely that we can fix it if we troubleshoot a little bit.
Sep 06 11:13:20 <cihancan>	whatever formatting it it will take less time than troubleshootin
Sep 06 11:15:20 <Kangie>	ok. Are you following a guide at all?
Sep 06 11:15:24 <Kelsar>	install is not in build.log
Sep 06 11:15:27 <cihancan>	yes gentoo handbook
Sep 06 11:15:45 <Kangie>	Ok, cool.
Sep 06 11:15:47 <Kelsar>	chances are, those are just seek times
Sep 06 11:15:58 <Kelsar>	and nothing will change at all
Sep 06 11:16:14 <cihancan>	need to reboot now
Sep 06 11:16:23 <Kangie>	cihancan, installing a lot of small files can be really slow on a mechanical hdd. Keep that in mind.
Sep 06 11:19:35 <Kangie>	well that was fruitless.
Sep 06 11:25:03 <cihancan>	pff i guess i destroyed windows bootloader
Sep 06 11:25:14 <cihancan>	whatever now i need to install gentoo %100
Sep 06 11:27:06 <josef64>	my current Gentoo is ~then years old, it works fine without new install
Sep 06 11:32:15 <cihancan>	josef64: i messed with some git versions of xorg it break things before it was my installation was working quite good
Sep 06 11:32:29 <cihancan>	sorry for bad english
Sep 06 11:32:39 <cihancan>	it works pretty good
Sep 06 11:32:58 <cihancan>	but today im experiencing some stupid bugs with the new installation tries
Sep 06 11:33:42 <Kangie>	cihancan, what installation medium are you using? a Mint livecd?
Sep 06 11:33:47 <cihancan>	yes
Sep 06 11:34:01 <cihancan>	i always use ubuntu live cd for gentoo installation
Sep 06 11:34:04 <Kangie>	ok. Just curious. Good luck with your install.
Sep 06 11:35:10 <cihancan>	ty
Sep 06 11:36:22 <cihancan>	Kangie: now it installs normally
Sep 06 11:36:36 <cihancan>	something break emerge last time
Sep 06 11:45:00 <cihancan>	Kangie: handbook recommends me to do ln -sf /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab im suspecting last time emerge broke because of this should i skip this? or it is mandatory?
Sep 06 11:46:27 <Kelsar>	nothing to do with emerge
Sep 06 11:47:54 <eseifert>	Hi! I'm struggling to get image support (PNG, JPEG, TIFF) in dev-lang/R. This shows USE flags and output in R on my machine: http://dpaste.com/3M8MXRN
Sep 06 11:48:07 <eseifert>	Is there someone around who knows how to solve this?
Sep 06 11:49:10 <Kelsar>	eseifert: cairo i guess
Sep 06 11:50:26 <eseifert>	Kelsar: Thanks! So, I should disable cairo?
Sep 06 11:51:17 <Kelsar>	eseifert: now, but i mean, that is a graphics library handling those things
Sep 06 11:51:20 <Kangie>	uh hold on cihancan
Sep 06 11:54:40 <eseifert>	Kelsar: I see. I'll dig into cairo problems then.
Sep 06 11:54:56 <Kangie>	eseifert, got a build log for that package?
Sep 06 11:55:09 <Kangie>	I suspect the configuration step will shed some light on it.
Sep 06 11:55:33 <Kelsar>	eseifert: maybe R deactivates png support, if cairo support is build, dunno. look at the R ebuild i would suggest
Sep 06 11:57:27 <Kangie>	nothing in the ebuild to suggest that.
Sep 06 11:58:47 <Kangie>	eseifert, check the configuration. or unpack the ebuild and run the configuration script.
Sep 06 11:59:02 <Kangie>	Sorry, check the configuration when you emerge or *
Sep 06 12:21:25 <cihancan>	Kangie: how to move boot partition to somewhere else?
Sep 06 12:21:54 <cihancan>	i mean i need to move files to another partition but how to copy them keeping file rights
Sep 06 12:22:51 <Kelsar>	cp -a
Sep 06 12:22:57 <cihancan>	ok
Sep 06 12:30:22 <Kelsar>	or rsync -a
Sep 06 12:40:29 <eseifert>	Thanks Kelsar! I could get image support working in dev-lang/R by setting USE="X" for in dev-lang/R and x11-libs/cairo.
Sep 06 12:40:42 <Kelsar>	eseifert: nice
Sep 06 12:41:00 <eseifert>	I just tried to avoid USE="X" because it's a headless machine and the dev-lang/R ebuild says "|| ( cairo X )" for all image USE flags.
Sep 06 12:47:23 <mitigate>	if i use layman and i want to regenerate the  files under /var/lib/layman/overlay/metadata/md5-cache how do i do it?
Sep 06 12:47:54 <mitigate>	i think i have prefix related problem qlop -lu doesnt show the installed packages it just reports package times
Sep 06 12:48:06 <mitigate>	last few package build times i think
Sep 06 13:08:48 <Kobboi>	libvpx related slot conflict, but I don't understand it: http://dpaste.com/28ESRRZ
Sep 06 13:32:23 <wokko>	Kobboi: Firefox's ebuild has 'system-libvpx? ( =media-libs/libvpx-1.7*:0=[postproc] )' which is why the issue
Sep 06 13:35:11 <Kangie>	any thoughts on why metagen would fail with the following error:
Sep 06 13:35:15 <Kangie>	    from repoman.checks.herds import herdbase
Sep 06 13:35:15 <Kangie>	ImportError: No module named herds
Sep 06 13:35:36 <Kangie>	I mean, obviously there's a missing module, but I assume that it should work?
Sep 06 13:37:01 <Kangie>	obviously repoman is installed, too.
Sep 06 13:37:52 <cihancan>	help needed
Sep 06 13:38:15 <cihancan>	emerge started to install very slowly
Sep 06 13:38:26 <cihancan>	it just happens without anything done
Sep 06 13:38:51 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 06 13:38:53 <Kangie>	same as before cihancan?
Sep 06 13:38:56 <cihancan>	yes
Sep 06 13:39:05 <cihancan>	it just happened on itself
Sep 06 13:39:06 <Kelsar>	it is a spinning disk moving many small files
Sep 06 13:39:18 <cihancan>	there is no io
Sep 06 13:39:31 <cihancan>	only a few kbyte in a few seconds
Sep 06 13:39:32 <Kelsar>	yes, totaly expected
Sep 06 13:39:47 <cihancan>	how do i fix that i t was working 5 minutes ago
Sep 06 13:39:56 <cihancan>	it was installing files in normal haste
Sep 06 13:40:02 <wokko>	Kangie: metagen just installed fine here so must be your end
Sep 06 13:40:34 <Kangie>	wokko, does it run?
Sep 06 13:40:38 <Kangie>	even --help fails for me
Sep 06 13:40:44 <Kelsar>	get an ssd cihancan, really waht you describe is the normal behaviour, as far as i can tell from your description
Sep 06 13:40:52 <ameliadolly>	Hallo
Sep 06 13:41:04 <wokko>	Kangie: good question, never used it.... let me see :)
Sep 06 13:41:04 <Kangie>	Hi ameliadolly. What can we help with?
Sep 06 13:41:09 <cihancan>	Kelsar: man you dont understand it was working normally 10 minutes ago
Sep 06 13:41:16 <cihancan>	it is not harddisk
Sep 06 13:41:29 <Kelsar>	cihancan: i understand, you don't understand what is happening
Sep 06 13:41:47 <ameliadolly>	Who want to dating with me and earn money join here http://kortlink.no/gYs
Sep 06 13:41:52 <cihancan>	where do i look for lock files normally in ?
Sep 06 13:42:01 <Kangie>	...
Sep 06 13:42:12 <cihancan>	i mean portage lock files
Sep 06 13:42:27 <Kelsar>	cihancan: individual files aren't getting locked
Sep 06 13:43:10 <cihancan>	it takes 10 seconds to build a package and 5 minutes to install it is that normal?
Sep 06 13:43:16 <Kelsar>	cihancan: it is fast 1st, before it can cache a lot in your ram and write later, once your memory cache is filled up, it gets slower
Sep 06 13:43:33 <cihancan>	i rebooted man
Sep 06 13:43:34 <wokko>	Kangie: seem to work fine here
Sep 06 13:43:44 <Kangie>	Cheers wokko. I'll work it out. :)
Sep 06 13:43:48 <Kelsar>	and i am sure you are exaggerating
Sep 06 13:43:50 <cihancan>	wokko man emerge started to install very slowly
Sep 06 13:43:59 <cihancan>	it builds fast but installs very slowly
Sep 06 13:44:21 <cihancan>	ive checked io activity and its very slow only a few kilobytes in 30 seconds
Sep 06 13:44:57 <BtbN>	kb/s mean nothing, it's about iops
Sep 06 13:45:22 <cihancan>	it was working normal i started another emerge while one is running and it happened now it moves very slowly
Sep 06 13:45:35 <cihancan>	ive rebooted and still happens
Sep 06 13:45:53 <cihancan>	is there a lock file or sth somewhere i should delete?
Sep 06 13:46:36 <BtbN>	Your HDD is not gonna get any faster after a reboot, why would it?
Sep 06 13:47:06 <ameliadolly>	You can join in here for get to money baby http://kortlink.no/gYs
Sep 06 13:47:56 <cihancan>	Kelsar: im not exaggerating man something is wrong
Sep 06 13:49:29 <wokko>	cihancan: clean out /var/tmp/portage/ check to see if your running out of hdd space ???
Sep 06 13:50:26 <cihancan>	wokko: this is a new install i have 30gb of spare
Sep 06 13:51:36 <wokko>	cihancan: check inodes too 'df -i'
Sep 06 13:52:08 <cihancan>	what to look at
Sep 06 13:52:18 <cihancan>	max %17
Sep 06 13:52:24 <cihancan>	others used %1
Sep 06 13:52:27 <wokko>	heaps
Sep 06 13:53:04 <ameliadolly>	Join and see the video naked I am here for free http://kortlink.no/gYs
Sep 06 13:53:26 <wokko>	cihancan: sledge hammer comes in handy too, fixes most things :)
Sep 06 13:53:34 <cihancan>	im about to
Sep 06 13:53:40 <wokko>	:)
Sep 06 13:53:54 <cihancan>	but this computer doesnt deserve this maybe some gentoo developers do
Sep 06 13:54:36 <cihancan>	i bought this thing for its 4 cores thinking i would install gentoo faster
Sep 06 13:54:53 <cihancan>	its totally a bug people doesnt even believe that im hacing it
Sep 06 13:55:18 <wokko>	cihancan: spinning rust or ssd ?
Sep 06 13:55:21 <Kangie>	cihancan, more cores will speed compilation, but if the IO speed is an issue the install will take longer.
Sep 06 13:55:37 <cihancan>	wokko: spinning disk and it was working ok 15 mintes ago
Sep 06 13:56:03 <cihancan>	now installing built packages takes 5 min to copy
Sep 06 13:56:08 <wokko>	run fsck on it
Sep 06 13:57:17 <Kobboi>	wokko: I would then expect portage to keep libvpx-1.7.0 and not block the updating of other packages because of it
Sep 06 13:57:19 <cihancan>	wokko /dev/sdb5 is in use.
Sep 06 13:57:24 <cihancan>	ive unmounted it already
Sep 06 13:57:47 <cihancan>	reboot?
Sep 06 13:58:30 <Kangie>	It'll do the job.
Sep 06 14:00:08 <wokko>	Kobboi: dunno, seems strange for ~arch package relying on a arch lib unless libvpx1.7 was ~arch and has just become stable ?
Sep 06 14:02:40 <wokko>	Kobboi: bug 693510
Sep 06 14:02:42 <willikins>	wokko: https://bugs.gentoo.org/693510 "=media-libs/libvpx-1.7.0 stabilization"; Gentoo Linux, Stabilization; CONF; whissi:media-video
Sep 06 14:02:51 <wokko>	!botsnack
Sep 06 14:02:51 <willikins>	wokko: ta :)
Sep 06 14:03:44 <wokko>	Kobboi: should file a bug on firefox for it
Sep 06 14:03:58 <Kobboi>	because of what exactly
Sep 06 14:04:03 <Kobboi>	i have been talking to whissi about it
Sep 06 14:04:32 <Kobboi>	there's nothing wrong with firefox wanting <libvpx-1.8, i would say
Sep 06 14:05:01 <wokko>	Kobboi: becos firefox 69 now relies on a stable libvpx1.7
Sep 06 14:05:20 <Kobboi>	what is wrong with depending on a stable library, some only come in stable versions
Sep 06 14:06:06 <Kangie>	It's expected behaviour though. You asked emerge to update (I assume) your @world
Sep 06 14:06:30 <wokko>	Kobboi: that means you will get a block as you RE WITH YOUR OTHER ~ARCH PACKAGES THAT CAN USE 1.8
Sep 06 14:06:33 <Kangie>	so it tried to grab the latest libvpx package, found that it would cause an issue, then informed you of it.
Sep 06 14:06:36 <Kobboi>	my @system, which because of a custom profile effectively equals my @world
Sep 06 14:06:45 <wokko>	sorry for the caps
Sep 06 14:06:47 <Kobboi>	np
Sep 06 14:07:13 <Kangie>	yeah, I actually read that as yelling. 0.o My inner monologue was screaming.
Sep 06 14:07:48 <wokko>	Kangie: lol, fat pinky hit caps key instead of 'a'
Sep 06 14:08:14 <Kangie>	also, Kobboi - that's probably a big part of why 1.8 is still masked.
Sep 06 14:09:47 <mitigate>	sddm input devices freeze if elogind is running. if i stop elogind it starts working again
Sep 06 14:10:38 <mitigate>	I dont think i can figure this out!
Sep 06 14:11:08 <Kangie>	mitigate, what do you mean by freeze?
Sep 06 14:11:19 <Kangie>	like, no kb+mouse in x while elogind is running?
Sep 06 14:14:30 <ricks_>	Since trying a systemd profile, my no-multlib profile has been inheriting the multilib.eclass. Can I just delete that eclass from the portage git tree?
Sep 06 14:15:38 <Kangie>	ricks_, no. next sync it'll be back I'm pretty sure.
Sep 06 14:16:21 <iamben>	ricks_: that doesn't just enable multilib builds
Sep 06 14:16:42 <mitigate>	I cant use the keyboard or mouse when i get the sddm login screen. i cant even C-M-F1 to vt1. I can login from a remote machine and turn off elogind and then the mouse and keyboard start responding
Sep 06 14:16:54 <iamben>	your profile isnt inheriting anthing, certain ebuilds use that to determine the proper library path for install, among other things
Sep 06 14:17:16 <Kangie>	interesting.
Sep 06 14:17:32 <ricks_>	Kangie, it surprisingly didn't, though I know I can reset it as a fail safe
Sep 06 14:17:45 <iamben>	the eclass which is actually used to build 32bit things, is multilib-build... but don't delete it, it's harmless and doesn't enable 32bit builds unless you turn stuff on yourself
Sep 06 14:18:08 <ricks_>	iamben, I see. It's probably an issue with my linker then, thank you
Sep 06 14:18:14 <hanetzer>	here's an idea/question. you know how you can -march=foo a binary into being unable to execute on another cpu? is there a sort of in-kernel emulation one could use to get around that?
Sep 06 14:18:26 <iamben>	what problem are you actually facing?
Sep 06 14:18:26 <Kelsar>	ricks_: which profile are you currently using?
Sep 06 14:18:51 <mitigate>	why would qlop only show the build timings from the past xxx hours ? i expect qlop -l to show a list of all installed packages
Sep 06 14:19:09 <iamben>	mitigate: new portage-utils behaves differently
Sep 06 14:19:18 <iamben>	qlop got a full rewrite, -l shows last emerge only
Sep 06 14:19:32 <mitigate>	aha
Sep 06 14:20:05 <iamben>	i think qlop -m is what you're looking for now?
Sep 06 14:20:23 <ricks_>	Kelsar, originally default/linux/amd64/17.1/no-multilib with masks to use systemd, then a custom default/linux/amd64/17.1/systemd/desktop/plasma/no-multilib, now back to the first
Sep 06 14:20:41 <_Cute_Kitty_>	Hi. How do I give my user account sudo permissions? in debian I would do sudo su root, then sudo adduser myname root
Sep 06 14:20:49 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but that doesn't work in gentoo
Sep 06 14:20:51 <wokko>	qlop use to have a 'g' option for logging the builds in a group
Sep 06 14:21:03 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: visudo to add your user to sudoers file
Sep 06 14:21:05 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, if you can su, edit /etc/sudoers
Sep 06 14:22:01 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, alternately, add your user to the group wheel, and enable that option (commented near the start of sudoers).
Sep 06 14:22:14 <ricks_>	If I knew how to collate all the variables for a profile I think I'd get what I'm actually doing when stacking them
Sep 06 14:22:36 <iamben>	ricks_: what problem are you facing?
Sep 06 14:24:07 <ricks_>	iamben, I'd like to have a profile that inherited desktop/plasma/systemd with no-multilib instead of cobbling it together in portage/profile
Sep 06 14:26:30 <iamben>	well unfortunately you're going to either need a custom profile or some stuff in /etc/portage
Sep 06 14:27:14 <iamben>	you can create a profile dir outside of the gentoo repo, which has "parent" file with desktop/plasma/systemd and arch/amd64/no-multilib in it
Sep 06 14:27:37 <iamben>	or jsut copy the arch/amd64/no-multilib/* stuff into /etc/portage/profile
Sep 06 14:28:34 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I'm sorry I got disconnected
Sep 06 14:28:38 <iamben>	but deleting eclasses isnt the solution =)
Sep 06 14:28:42 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I edited /etc/sudoers
Sep 06 14:28:50 <ricks_>	That's actually comforting to know in certainty. iirc the BOOTSTRAP_USE has multilib in it for systemd. i did the opposite and copied the desktop-systemd junk into profile, thanks again
Sep 06 14:28:51 <ricks_>	:p
Sep 06 14:28:53 <Kangie>	but you can't sudo?
Sep 06 14:28:58 <_Cute_Kitty_>	and I uncommented the line under ##uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
Sep 06 14:29:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i can sudo, but when i open portage manager it still says "not root"
Sep 06 14:29:23 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: portage manager?
Sep 06 14:29:26 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes
Sep 06 14:29:33 <iamben>	what command are you running which doesn't work?
Sep 06 14:29:36 <_Cute_Kitty_>	the porthole portage frontend
Sep 06 14:29:45 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I'm not running a command, I'm trying to run that app as root
Sep 06 14:29:49 <_Cute_Kitty_>	every time i click on it
Sep 06 14:30:02 <iamben>	how did you sudo a click?
Sep 06 14:30:07 <_Cute_Kitty_>	idk
Sep 06 14:30:15 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i didn't that's why it's not opening as root
Sep 06 14:30:19 <cihancan>	no one ever experienced the bug i had looks like this distribution have so little users
Sep 06 14:30:33 <iamben>	just adding your user to sudoers doesn't make every user command run as root
Sep 06 14:30:35 <cihancan>	i guess ill jump the boat and install funtoo
Sep 06 14:30:51 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok. so what file do i edit to get the command to open that app to run as root :)
Sep 06 14:30:53 <iamben>	cihancan: yeah funtoo has tons more users
Sep 06 14:31:04 <cihancan>	iamben: maybe it has lesser bugs
Sep 06 14:31:18 <iamben>	cihancan: it has lots more bugs and is worse in almost every way, but have fun
Sep 06 14:31:19 <iamben>	too
Sep 06 14:31:44 <cihancan>	iamben: gentoo doesnt work here
Sep 06 14:31:46 <_Cute_Kitty_>	sorry i'm new to gentoo lol. that's the way it worked in debian. if I wanted to open synaptic package manager as root I just added my name to the root list and everytime i opened it it opened with root privileges
Sep 06 14:31:50 <cihancan>	i couldnt fix my problem
Sep 06 14:31:58 <iamben>	cihancan: sorry to hear that, good luck with funtoo though
Sep 06 14:32:11 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, add your user to the portage group
Sep 06 14:32:21 <_Cute_Kitty_>	how
Sep 06 14:32:26 <wokko>	_Cute_Kitty_: Fyi, porthole hasn't been updated since 2014, emerge is quite easy to learn
Sep 06 14:32:54 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so what's the correct way to install applications?!
Sep 06 14:33:06 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: you can run emerge from a root shell
Sep 06 14:33:12 <iamben>	that's what most of us do
Sep 06 14:33:41 <wokko>	_Cute_Kitty_: eg 'emerge --ask --verbose firefox '
Sep 06 14:33:47 <ricks_>	_Cute_Kitty_, did you install a terminal emulator before X?
Sep 06 14:33:56 <Necktwi>	is bios boot partition really necessary? virtual box doesn't boot my gentoo physical partition. I've added a 2gb virtual disk for boot partition and installed grub to it. but vbox won't boot it unlike vmware.
Sep 06 14:34:08 <Kangie>	Necktwi, it will.
Sep 06 14:34:09 <iamben>	Necktwi: it's necessary for grub+gpt+bios
Sep 06 14:34:16 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so how do I install something simple like neofetch Kangie:
Sep 06 14:34:18 <iamben>	only for that specific combo
Sep 06 14:34:22 <Kangie>	does it boot to 'uefi console'?
Sep 06 14:34:24 <Necktwi>	my vbox is uefi
Sep 06 14:34:31 <iamben>	Necktwi: it's not used for UEFI at all.
Sep 06 14:34:34 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i have xfce 4 terminal
Sep 06 14:34:42 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: emerge -av neofetch
Sep 06 14:34:55 <Necktwi>	what's not used for uefi?
Sep 06 14:35:03 <iamben>	Necktwi: bios boto partition
Sep 06 14:35:09 <iamben>	the thing you asked about
Sep 06 14:35:11 <Necktwi>	ha thought so
Sep 06 14:35:15 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so -av is shorthand for ask and verbose
Sep 06 14:35:19 <cihancan>	sorry to lose this awesome community
Sep 06 14:35:27 <iamben>	cihancan: goodbye
Sep 06 14:35:29 <ricks_>	:(
Sep 06 14:35:42 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok so it finished that command but when i type neofetch it says command not found :(
Sep 06 14:35:45 <Kangie>	iamben beat me.
Sep 06 14:35:50 <Kangie>	curlybracket, that's right.
Sep 06 14:35:55 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, rather
Sep 06 14:36:00 <iamben>	ricks_: he's publically pouting to get more sympathy & attention on his support request, don't fall for it
Sep 06 14:36:13 <ricks_>	yes and i find it a bit funny
Sep 06 14:36:14 <Necktwi>	will removing bios boot partition work?
Sep 06 14:36:16 <Kangie>	'emerge -av neofetch'
Sep 06 14:36:34 <Kangie>	Necktwi, is your issue that it boots to 'uefi console' instead of grub?
Sep 06 14:36:36 <iamben>	Necktwi: having the unneeded partition wont cause any problems on UEFI.  are you using grub?
Sep 06 14:36:49 <Necktwi>	it boot to some shell
Sep 06 14:37:02 <Kangie>	ok.
Sep 06 14:37:05 <iamben>	Necktwi: a "grub>" shell or somethign else?
Sep 06 14:37:10 <Kangie>	So virtualbox is a bit 'bad' at uefi
Sep 06 14:37:11 <Necktwi>	not grub
Sep 06 14:37:13 <Kangie>	there's a fix for this.
Sep 06 14:37:25 <iamben>	Necktwi: you're wanting grub though, right?
Sep 06 14:37:27 <Necktwi>	some other shell with blue screen
Sep 06 14:37:35 <Necktwi>	yes i want grub
Sep 06 14:37:56 <iamben>	what command did you use for grub-install?
Sep 06 14:38:01 <Kangie>	cool. i have a fix. Gimme a minute.
Sep 06 14:38:02 <_Cute_Kitty_>	following use changes are necessary: required by app -misc/neofetch-9999 required by neofetch (Argument)
Sep 06 14:38:16 <Necktwi>	i read some where vbox will suppurt either uefi or bios but not both
Sep 06 14:38:17 <_Cute_Kitty_>	www-client /w3m-0.5.3p20190105 imli
Sep 06 14:38:17 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: do you know how to set USE flags?
Sep 06 14:38:23 <_Cute_Kitty_>	no
Sep 06 14:38:25 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, are you running ~amd64?
Sep 06 14:38:34 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: you need to know how to set USE flags, it's in the handbook
Sep 06 14:38:43 <Necktwi>	grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot
Sep 06 14:38:43 <Necktwi>	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Sep 06 14:38:46 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i'm running a raspberry pi with a 64 bit gentoo image
Sep 06 14:38:55 <iamben>	Necktwi: try that grub-install command again with --removable
Sep 06 14:39:03 <Kangie>	neck
Sep 06 14:39:09 <Kangie>	Necktwi, https://askubuntu.com/questions/566315/virtualbox-boots-only-in-uefi-interactive-shell
Sep 06 14:39:20 <hanetzer>	reason I'm asking is I'm thinking that popping my laptop hard drive out every now and then and popping it into my main machine, chrooting and upgrading would be a more 'doable' option instead of fsck'ing around with dstcc
Sep 06 14:39:24 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: neofetch isnt keyworded for arm, so it's asking for extra unmasks
Sep 06 14:39:40 <iamben>	it'd be a lot easier if you learned gentoo on a major arch like amd64 first
Sep 06 14:39:56 <_Cute_Kitty_>	oh i see, so it's an architecture issue
Sep 06 14:39:58 <hanetzer>	ah yeh. that's is problematic :)
Sep 06 14:40:03 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i'll just skip installing that for now
Sep 06 14:40:20 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but normally if that was right it would have just installed after the first command right
Sep 06 14:40:23 <hanetzer>	its an easy fix tho. I've had to do it for 'more important' packages in the past.
Sep 06 14:40:36 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: mostly yes, unless some extra USE changes were required
Sep 06 14:40:53 <hanetzer>	yeah, emerge neofetch should install it if there are no keyword issues :)
Sep 06 14:41:08 <_Cute_Kitty_>	thanks
Sep 06 14:41:10 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, that's right.
Sep 06 14:41:15 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I'll look into use changes later
Sep 06 14:42:37 <iamben>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Working/USE
Sep 06 14:42:40 <Kangie>	hanetzer, did you start and finish a thought an hour and a half apart?
Sep 06 14:42:59 <hanetzer>	Kangie: no, just realized it would be a good idea to explain myself
Sep 06 14:43:23 <ricks_>	that is a good thing to do, yes
Sep 06 14:43:30 <hanetzer>	both processors are amd, but one is ryzen and the other is something like bdver4
Sep 06 14:43:48 <Kangie>	well hanetzer, ryzen should support everything that your laptop chipset supports
Sep 06 14:43:55 <Kangie>	so rather than setting march=native
Sep 06 14:44:03 <Kangie>	do cpuid2cpuflags
Sep 06 14:44:03 *	wokko now knows how those arch base distros have those fancy starts to there terminals, with neofetch :)
Sep 06 14:44:21 <_Cute_Kitty_>	how do I install something with all needed dependencies?
Sep 06 14:44:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	would -av do that
Sep 06 14:44:31 <Kangie>	emerge will handle that automatically.
Sep 06 14:44:31 <hanetzer>	Kangie: yeah, I set cpuid2cpuflags and the march=znver1 or whatever the proper option is. I don't use bare native
Sep 06 14:44:40 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I'm trying to install x11-themes/arc-theme now :)
Sep 06 14:44:41 <Kangie>	then you'll be fine.
Sep 06 14:44:44 <hanetzer>	_Cute_Kitty_: just like most distros, it will pull them all automaticaly :)
Sep 06 14:44:55 <Kangie>	If your plan is to throw it into the PC and use the ryzen to do massive compiles
Sep 06 14:45:04 <_Cute_Kitty_>	it's giving me a keyword chnages error though.
Sep 06 14:45:12 <Kangie>	assuming that znver1 is the march of your laptop
Sep 06 14:45:19 <hanetzer>	Kangie: no, that's the pc
Sep 06 14:45:26 <Kangie>	ok. You want to set it for the laptop
Sep 06 14:45:32 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: that one also isnt keyworded for arm
Sep 06 14:45:33 <Kangie>	so even when it's in the PC it builds binaries that work on the laptop.
Sep 06 14:45:36 <hanetzer>	yeah. unsure what the laptop is offhand.
Sep 06 14:45:42 <Kangie>	dr google?
Sep 06 14:45:53 <ricks_>	Wouldn't you need to add --deep to pull *all* dependencies?
Sep 06 14:45:56 <hanetzer>	about to boot the laptop with the gentoo iso and do some probing
Sep 06 14:46:01 <Kangie>	ricks_, no.
Sep 06 14:46:35 <Kangie>	If you need something to build, run, etc, it's specified in the ebuild.
Sep 06 14:46:37 <_Cute_Kitty_>	is gentoo an rpm based distro or debian based
Sep 06 14:46:38 <_Cute_Kitty_>	rpm right
Sep 06 14:46:43 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so I need gtk3-devel
Sep 06 14:46:47 <hanetzer>	_Cute_Kitty_: neither.
Sep 06 14:46:54 <Kangie>	If they have dependencies that need to be enabled too, they'll be pulled in.
Sep 06 14:46:55 <Kangie>	and so on
Sep 06 14:46:56 <hanetzer>	gentoo is a 'root' distro, or close to it.
Sep 06 14:46:57 <ricks_>	_Cute_Kitty_, echo '=app-misc/neofetch-9999 **' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
Sep 06 14:47:08 <wokko>	_Cute_Kitty_: source based distro
Sep 06 14:47:26 <_Cute_Kitty_>	rip lol
Sep 06 14:47:42 <hanetzer>	ricks_: I'd suggest instead setting app-misc/neofetch amd64 to get a 'version' not a live ebuild :)
Sep 06 14:48:06 *	ricks_ shrugs
Sep 06 14:48:30 <iamben>	_Cute_Kitty_: you do not need to worry about satisfying deps yourself, emerge does taht
Sep 06 14:49:14 <_Cute_Kitty_>	gotcha
Sep 06 14:49:38 <Kangie>	ricks_, for example, an ebuild I'm working on will check not only that a package is installed as part of its dependencies, it will check if a particular use flag is enabled as well.
Sep 06 14:49:41 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I'll be back around later guys with more questions, I've got some work to do :)  thanks for all the help so far
Sep 06 14:49:45 <Kangie>	(and most will do so)
Sep 06 14:50:31 <Necktwi>	sorry my net got broken, did i miss anything?
Sep 06 14:50:55 <iamben>	Necktwi: try redoing grub-install with --removable appended
Sep 06 14:51:11 <Necktwi>	ok
Sep 06 14:51:19 <ricks_>	Kangie, i see, thanks for the tip
Sep 06 14:51:33 <hanetzer>	iamben: --removeable is useful :)
Sep 06 14:51:37 <iamben>	that makes it install grub's efi image to the default EFI boot location, $ESP/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi, so it will work even without the custom entry created via efibootmgr (which sometimes doesn't work, on fussy UEFI impls)
Sep 06 14:52:10 <hanetzer>	yeah. especially useful if its an 'on-the-go' install on usb or something :)
Sep 06 15:00:31 <hanetzer>	huh.
Sep 06 15:00:43 <Kangie>	?
Sep 06 15:01:00 <hanetzer>	ls shows broken symlinks as flashing...
Sep 06 15:01:06 <hanetzer>	never seen that before.
Sep 06 15:05:22 <iamben>	it's done that for as long as i can remember
Sep 06 15:07:43 <hanetzer>	been using various linuxes since 2012 or so, can't recall ever seeing that :P
Sep 06 15:07:59 <hanetzer>	anywho.
Sep 06 15:08:41 <iamben>	that's good, you've not had a lot of broken symlinks =)
Sep 06 15:12:00 <hanetzer>	hmm. nope. illegal opcode.
Sep 06 15:12:16 <Kangie>	doing what, hanetzer
Sep 06 15:12:25 <iamben>	what CFLAGS @ build time, and what cpu @ runtime?
Sep 06 15:12:37 <hanetzer>	emerging. lets see.
Sep 06 15:13:31 <hanetzer>	well, kinda both. I've chrooted into the march=bdver4 rootfs from a running znver1 system
Sep 06 15:14:43 <iamben>	according to man gcc, bdver4 enables a few things znver1 doesn't (have)
Sep 06 15:14:50 <Necktwi>	iamben, --removable worked
Sep 06 15:14:55 <iamben>	Necktwi: cool
Sep 06 15:15:38 <hanetzer>	iamben: yeah, which is why I was wondering about emulating opcodes; I think arm can do that for some stuff...
Sep 06 15:16:05 <iamben>	hanetzer: while that might be possible in theory, no the kernel cannot do that currently, afaik.  qemu maybe.
Sep 06 15:16:14 <iamben>	probably shoudl just build with better CFLAGS
Sep 06 15:16:36 <hanetzer>	could try crossdev. it may work better than an amd64->aarch64 cross
Sep 06 15:16:55 <iamben>	i can't think of any way crossdev would help at all
Sep 06 15:17:08 <iamben>	just fix your CFLAGS, no cross compiler needed
Sep 06 15:17:29 <Necktwi>	vbox takes lot of time at checking local filesystems but i don't see any disk activiy
Sep 06 15:17:31 <hanetzer>	how can I fix this? I specifically *want* bdver4
Sep 06 15:17:42 <iamben>	but you cannot build on bdver4?
Sep 06 15:18:00 <hanetzer>	iamben: I'd like to avoid it. the bdver4 machine is 'weak' :P
Sep 06 15:18:03 <Kangie>	hanetzer wants to build for bdver4 on ryzen
Sep 06 15:18:12 <hanetzer>	threads man :)
Sep 06 15:18:16 <Kangie>	hanetzer, find a subset of cpuflags that both have
Sep 06 15:18:18 <Kangie>	and set that.
Sep 06 15:18:44 <Kangie>	you'll lose some instructions off the bdver4, but it'll work on both cpus.
Sep 06 15:18:44 <iamben>	your best bet will probably be to set -march=bdver4 but add a seris of -mno-foo args to disable the things that znver1 can't handle
Sep 06 15:24:25 <ricks_>	hanetzer, diff -y --suppress-common-lines <(gcc -march=bdver4 --target-help -Q | grep disabled) <(gcc -march=znver1 --target-help -Q | grep disabled)
Sep 06 15:25:40 <nexgen>	hello
Sep 06 15:25:55 <nexgen>	please let me know why emerge --sync does not work
Sep 06 15:26:08 <nexgen>	a problem with GPG keys server update
Sep 06 15:26:54 <Necktwi>	vbox takes lot of time at checking local filesystems but i don't see any disk activiy
Sep 06 15:28:51 <Necktwi>	it didn't happen with vmware or during physical boot
Sep 06 15:29:09 <hanetzer>	hmm. is there a way to determine which opcode is failing from the dmesg output?
Sep 06 15:30:46 <iamben>	nexgen: does it work after rebuilding gnutls?
Sep 06 15:31:48 <hanetzer>	ricks_: if I understand this correctly, I should add the disabled options from the znver1 output to the bdver4 root?
Sep 06 15:32:08 <iamben>	hanetzer: i think you might need a debugger to get the exact opcode
Sep 06 15:34:14 <hanetzer>	iamben: ah, so no easyish way to do so.
Sep 06 15:35:18 <iamben>	as i understand it
Sep 06 15:37:54 <hanetzer>	huh... does portage grab the make jobs count if you don't set it yourself?
Sep 06 15:38:25 <Kangie>	no?
Sep 06 15:38:28 <iamben>	"emake" in portage has some logic to call make -j$(nproc) if makeopts is unset
Sep 06 15:38:30 <Xelnor>	hanetzer: maybe try `-mtune=bdver4` and a suitable -march to match both CPUs?
Sep 06 15:38:36 <iamben>	so sorta yes
Sep 06 15:38:45 <iamben>	if you want 1 job, force it
Sep 06 15:38:46 <ricks_>	hanetzer, i think so, im a bit tired right now. something like -mno-fma4 and so on added to your cflags. this could also be accomplished with setting the -march and emerging for binaries only

Sep 07 11:34:29 <pie>	i have built gtk+ with the ABI_X86_32

Sep 07 12:20:52 <pie>	it works with opengl, but crashes immediately with vulkan
Sep 07 12:26:31 <ratrace>	pie: under wine or native steam + proton?
Sep 07 12:26:44 <pie>	ratrace: steam + proton
Sep 07 12:27:06 <therealfarfetchd>	pie: doom only works with steam runtime for some reason
Sep 07 12:27:30 <ratrace>	pie: hmm yeah. same here, but last year I played doom under wine, with vulcan, just fine
Sep 07 12:27:48 <ratrace>	so back then, and directly under wine, it worked, but under steam+proton only opengl works
Sep 07 12:27:53 <pie>	therealfarfetchd: i cant even get steam to launch without runtime, i solved all the library errors but now it gets stuck on logging in user, and the console spams appdatacache.cpp (2197) : Assertion Failed: !bSharedKVSymbols
Sep 07 12:46:38 <NekoMay>	What package includes the "decode-dimms" utility?
Sep 07 12:49:09 <ricks__>	NekoMay, http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/decode-dimms.1.html seems to be i2c-tools
Sep 07 12:49:21 <NekoMay>	ricks__: Not true for Gentoo
Sep 07 12:49:37 <ricks__>	yup, just checked and i have it installed
Sep 07 12:50:03 <NekoMay>	Yeah, I was looking at the list of installed files but didn't see it, sorry
Sep 07 12:50:39 <ricks__>	best bet would be to run 'equery f i2c-tools and run each of those binaries in /usr/sbin and see if one of them is what you're looking for
Sep 07 12:50:44 <ricks__>	might've renamed it?
Sep 07 12:51:15 <NekoMay>	Nah, it's there now, just running low on brainpower
Sep 07 12:51:19 <NekoMay>	lol
Sep 07 12:51:26 <NekoMay>	Thanks for the help
Sep 07 12:52:05 <ricks__>	magical
Sep 07 12:52:06 <ricks__>	lol
Sep 07 12:54:00 <NekoMay>	Ah
Sep 07 12:54:06 <NekoMay>	You have to have the perl
Sep 07 12:54:09 <NekoMay>	USE flag enabled
Sep 07 12:56:11 <NekoMay>	A flag not listed on packages.gentoo.org
Sep 07 12:56:19 <NekoMay>	And none of lm_sensors local flags are listed
Sep 07 12:56:21 <ricks__>	hm
Sep 07 12:57:13 <ricks__>	you might benefit from emerging gentoolkit and eix
Sep 07 12:57:32 <ricks__>	though that's odd that it doesnt state that decode-dimms requires perl
Sep 07 12:59:51 <NekoMay>	packages. doesn't list it as a USE flag
Sep 07 13:00:24 <NekoMay>	It's definitely a valid flag, but according to the site, it's not
Sep 07 13:00:53 <NekoMay>	I think there might be something messed up with packages. because as I mentioned, none of lm_sensors local USE flags are listed
Sep 07 13:02:34 <ricks__>	ive found that to be the case for both gentoolkit and the official website
Sep 07 13:03:17 <ricks__>	never figured out why...but i personally do global flags for what i need
Sep 07 14:07:29 <Inepu>	hi all
Sep 07 14:07:57 <Inepu>	depclean suggests me to delete these packages https://ncry.pt/p/daPn#XZayEYgycsscmc7jDVB8CdjTBg49uj_519harn6AfMo
Sep 07 14:08:47 <javashin>	hello
Sep 07 14:09:01 <javashin>	i cannot boot gentoo with openrc and genkernel
Sep 07 14:09:12 <javashin>	i got this on boot /lib/rc/sh/init.sh line 104 echo write error : no space left on device
Sep 07 14:09:27 <Inepu>	but I believe that udisks and killproc shouldn't be deleted. What should I do?
Sep 07 14:10:00 <javashin>	echo sysinit >"$RC_SVCDIR"/softlevel is line 104 on that file
Sep 07 14:10:39 <Inepu>	javashin, I'm a newbye, but perhaps isn't there space enough?
Sep 07 14:10:51 <javashin>	no
Sep 07 14:11:03 <javashin>	bunch of space left
Sep 07 14:11:14 <grknight>	Inepu: it's saying just one slot of udisks is eligible, but keeping the other
Sep 07 14:11:49 <Inepu>	ok grknight, thank you, it's true
Sep 07 14:12:53 <Inepu>	grknight, and killproc?
Sep 07 14:13:10 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 07 14:13:47 <cihancan>	iamben, i didnt sell my soul man ive installed arch linux for now ill wait that emerge bug to get resolved and install gentoo again
Sep 07 14:13:53 <grknight>	Inepu: killproc was only needed by scsi-rescan-bus as a package.  you're welcome to put it in world if you want to keep it
Sep 07 14:14:14 <grknight>	rescan-scsi-bus
Sep 07 14:15:15 <Inepu>	grknight, ok, understood, so I believe that really i don't need it
Sep 07 14:16:13 <Inepu>	thx grknight
Sep 07 14:20:16 <zxcat>	I have a constant message from portage about "emerge @preserved-rebuild", related to 3 packages that I already rebuild. How to "clean" that message way ?
Sep 07 14:46:56 <fling>	Which package for mencoder?
Sep 07 14:47:55 <fling>	mplayer with +encode ?
Sep 07 14:57:19 <grawity>	does mencoder still exist?
Sep 07 14:57:34 <grawity>	iirc it was just a poor wrapper around ffmpeg/avconv
Sep 07 14:57:37 <fling>	grawity: I have no idea, going to try it
Sep 07 14:58:06 <fling>	this way mpv and gstreamer might be considered as smart wrappers to ffmpeg too :P
Sep 07 14:59:38 <fling>	I'm having issues with out of order pts in uvc, going to to chop some input frames using mencoder
Sep 07 15:13:38 <javashin>	i cant boot ,  /lib/rc/sh/init.sh line 104 echo write error : no space left on device = line 104 " echo sysinit >"$RC_SVCDIR"/softlevel " this dont let me eat my brunch "rice with red beans pork and cazabe de yuca"  how i solve this so i can process my meal ?
Sep 07 15:18:57 <Xelnor>	javashin: df -i says what?
Sep 07 15:19:47 <javashin>	is not space
Sep 07 15:19:51 <javashin>	the problem
Sep 07 15:19:57 <Xelnor>	javashin: df -i is about inodes

Sep 07 15:22:27 <javashin>	now
Sep 07 15:23:11 <Xelnor>	wait a minute, where is that $RC_SVCDIR path?
Sep 07 15:23:38 <javashin>	   ? /run/openrc
Sep 07 15:25:54 <Xelnor>	and what is it mounted from?
Sep 07 15:25:54 <grawity>	doesn't ZFS have a dynamic inode limit? (like most other non-ext4 filesystems do)
Sep 07 15:28:10 <javashin>	Xelnor, i dont know openrc is supposed to do everything
Sep 07 15:29:01 <javashin>	its own stuff mounts proc sysfs dev etc etc
Sep 07 15:30:28 <Xelnor>	javashin: do you have a fstab entry for /run? or something in your initrd?
Sep 07 15:30:44 <javashin>	no
Sep 07 15:30:51 <javashin>	why would i
Sep 07 15:30:53 <Xelnor>	you're playing with zfs, which doesn't play nice with usual linux tools
Sep 07 15:31:00 <Xelnor>	so, well, maybe? :)
Sep 07 15:31:47 <Xelnor>	javashin: is it a vserver?
Sep 07 15:31:52 <javashin>	this is a gentoo systemd which im on now
Sep 07 15:31:54 <javashin>	no
Sep 07 15:32:06 <Xelnor>	err
Sep 07 15:32:11 <Xelnor>	openrc or systemd??
Sep 07 15:32:15 <javashin>	and gentoo systemd zfs = not a problem in 7 month
Sep 07 15:32:23 <javashin>	the one im trying to boot
Sep 07 15:32:30 <javashin>	is gentoo-openrc
Sep 07 15:32:46 <javashin>	zroot/ROOT/Gentoo > systemd
Sep 07 15:32:47 <Xelnor>	javashin: openrc mounts /run as a tmpfs
Sep 07 15:32:53 <Xelnor>	do you have enough ram?
Sep 07 15:32:56 <javashin>	zroot/ROOT/default [===-----------------]  12.2%   7.6G     54.5G  62.1G /mnt/gentoo-openrc
Sep 07 15:32:58 <javashin>	yes
Sep 07 15:33:00 <javashin>	8G
Sep 07 15:33:09 <Xelnor>	and how much is used by zfs?
Sep 07 15:33:16 <javashin>	now ?
Sep 07 15:33:28 <javashin>	on boot who knows ....
Sep 07 15:34:13 <Xelnor>	I'd suggest making a backup of /lib/rc/sh/init.sh, and adding a couple of test lines there
Sep 07 15:34:40 <Xelnor>	like showing the path it's using for RC_SVCDIR, showing the output of `mount` and `df -h` and `df -i` and `free -h`
Sep 07 15:47:14 <grknight>	the default of RC_SVCDIR is /run/openrc
Sep 07 15:47:31 <javashin>	grknight, how fix this ?
Sep 07 15:48:17 <javashin>	 /run must be empty ?
Sep 07 15:48:44 <Xelnor>	javashin: take a look at /lib/rc/sh/init.sh
Sep 07 15:49:04 <grknight>	if you do 'echo default > /run/openrc/runlevel'  what does it say?
Sep 07 15:49:54 <Xelnor>	javashin: do you see a line with `Mounting /run` before the failure?
Sep 07 15:50:34 <javashin>	im on gentoo systemd now
Sep 07 15:50:41 <grknight>	(yes I misspelled it, but that's ok)
Sep 07 15:50:46 <javashin>	i cannot boot gentoo oprnrc
Sep 07 15:51:08 <Xelnor>	basically, .../init.sh will mount a tmpfs (with 10% of ram as a max size) on /run during boot
Sep 07 15:51:13 <javashin>	Xelnor, yes
Sep 07 15:51:51 <Xelnor>	ok
Sep 07 15:52:09 <Xelnor>	anything about xenfs too? or just that message followed by the failure?
Sep 07 15:52:31 <javashin>	i changed to 30
Sep 07 15:52:36 <grknight>	javashin: start with init=/bin/bb or init=/bin/bash then run /lib/rc/sh/init.sh
Sep 07 15:52:36 <javashin>	let me reboot
Sep 07 15:52:47 <javashin>	ok
Sep 07 15:52:59 <javashin>	whats init=/bin/bb
Sep 07 15:53:00 <javashin>	bb
Sep 07 15:53:08 <grknight>	busybox shell
Sep 07 15:53:19 <javashin>	ok
Sep 07 15:53:22 <javashin>	good
Sep 07 15:53:38 <javashin>	and if i cannot write ?
Sep 07 15:53:56 <javashin>	the keyboard module has to be loaded ?
Sep 07 15:54:08 <Xelnor>	javashin: if you can't write, you'll be able to debug more :)
Sep 07 15:54:20 <grknight>	actually run this:
Sep 07 15:55:30 <grknight>	RC_SVCDIR=/run/openrc RC_LIBEXECDIR=/lib/rc /lib/rc/sh/init.sh
Sep 07 15:55:39 <grknight>	that will fill in necessary variables
Sep 07 15:57:09 <javashin>	on boot ?
Sep 07 15:57:16 <javashin>	after boot with bb ?
Sep 07 16:07:43 <kazdow>	fuck off
Sep 07 16:07:44 <kazdow>	fuck off
Sep 07 16:07:45 <kazdow>	fuck off

Sep 07 17:17:31 <javashin>	dunno was not booting
Sep 07 17:17:46 <javashin>	i had never cared about this
Sep 07 17:17:48 <grknight>	when you were having the issue, what was the size of /run?  you could have started /bin/bb or /bin/bash to know
Sep 07 17:18:02 <javashin>	always was fine out of the box
Sep 07 17:18:16 <javashin>	no
Sep 07 17:18:27 <javashin>	i cannot type on bb or bash as init
Sep 07 17:18:39 <javashin>	keyboard dont work
Sep 07 17:18:51 <javashin>	genkernel fault i think
Sep 07 17:18:55 <grknight>	probably because your keyboard driver was not included into the kernel (instead of as a module)
Sep 07 17:19:05 <grknight>	or the USB bus driver
Sep 07 17:19:09 <javashin>	yes is a module
Sep 07 17:21:43 <grknight>	it is possible to give the 'debug' option to the kernel commandline for genkernel's initramfs to stop at a shell to look around
Sep 07 17:21:56 <grknight>	for future troubleshooting

Sep 09 09:23:42 <Kangie>	honigkuchen, what redsh said - If you can explain what you're doing and why you're trying to do it, we might be able to put you onto a better solution.
Sep 09 09:24:13 <redsh>	Based on what he said on -chat, it's blender, which needs a bit more updating and some dependencies need to be updated as well.
Sep 09 09:24:28 <redsh>	Err, the ebuild needs updating, rather.
Sep 09 09:24:58 <Kangie>	yeah, I figured it would be that.
Sep 09 09:25:13 <honigkuchen>	I learned how blender solved such things by just putting depencies in home
Sep 09 09:25:28 <redsh>	Good luck updating to 2.81 like that :D
Sep 09 09:25:28 <honigkuchen>	and asked myself and you how such thing can be dealt in general
Sep 09 09:25:36 <Kangie>	Tbh it sounds like a whole bunch of the changes for blender 2.8 are to do with the python_target being 3.7
Sep 09 09:26:16 <redsh>	There was that link to a repo with some ebuilds. Taking a look at the ebuilds for anything sketchy and then adding them to your local overlay probably would've worked.
Sep 09 09:27:29 <redsh>	I've personally written some ebuilds. Not very complex ones, thankfully, since the build systems were sane.
Sep 09 09:28:03 <Kangie>	Yeah, most of the time if you update an ebuild's version number and stick it in your local overlay it'll grab the appropriate version sources and go ahead and compile them.
Sep 09 09:28:54 <redsh>	I mean actual new ones, not just version bumps :P
Sep 09 09:29:20 <redsh>	Projects do occasionally make bigger changes like new/removed dependencies or even change their build systems.
Sep 09 09:29:28 <Kangie>	oh yeah.
Sep 09 09:29:45 <Kangie>	I've got an ebuild in bugzilla now. I should really update that with the improved version I made.
Sep 09 09:40:01 <Paradox55>	iamben if/when you get on and if you see this, after reinstalling three times and messing with this all day the "solution" was to downgrade f2fs-tools to 1.10.0
Sep 09 09:40:11 <Paradox55>	little package mask, done
Sep 09 11:41:06 <ManDay>	Is Gstreamer not maintained currently?
Sep 09 11:41:47 <redsh>	`equery m gstreamer` seems to imply it does. Even a whole team?
Sep 09 11:42:36 <Polynomial-C>	Lemme guess... lack of gstreamer-1.16?
Sep 09 11:43:14 <Polynomial-C>	bug #690468
Sep 09 11:43:16 <willikins>	Polynomial-C: https://bugs.gentoo.org/690468 "media-libs/gstreamer-1.16.0 version bump"; Gentoo Linux, Current packages; CONF; chitty_cloud:gstreamer
Sep 09 11:44:31 <ManDay>	Polynomial-C: Among others, yes
Sep 09 11:44:41 <ManDay>	Thanks
Sep 09 11:50:21 <ManDay>	Hm, why would `emerge -uDN world` try to reemerge XYZ from ::gentoo while I have it (exact same version) shadowed in an overlay (which is pulled on `emerge XYZ`) ?
Sep 09 11:51:21 <Polynomial-C>	ManDay: usually overlay have precedence over ::gentoo
Sep 09 11:51:24 <Polynomial-C>	*overlays
Sep 09 11:51:57 <ManDay>	Polynomial-C: yes, that's why I don't understand why the -uDN will try to pull it from ::gentoo
Sep 09 11:52:17 <redsh>	The output might help.
Sep 09 11:52:21 <ManDay>	sure
Sep 09 11:53:16 <ManDay>	http://dpaste.com/3AE8PK6
Sep 09 11:53:18 <ManDay>	Your paste can be seen here:
Sep 09 11:54:51 <redsh>	Does the overlay mesa not have X in IUSE?
Sep 09 12:03:14 <ManDay>	redsh: There is no overlay mesa
Sep 09 12:03:22 <ManDay>	The overlay is gst-plugins-vaapi
Sep 09 12:03:31 <ManDay>	(which skips the mesa[X(+)])
Sep 09 12:03:56 <Polynomial-C>	ManDay: mask the ::gentoo version and run emerge again.
Sep 09 12:05:58 <ManDay>	Polynomial-C: Then it directly goes to pull the overlay version.
Sep 09 12:06:07 <ManDay>	Is that a bug in the resolver perhaps?
Sep 09 12:06:32 <Polynomial-C>	ManDay: perhaps the overlay has lower priority.
Sep 09 12:06:36 <lg188>	I'm using xfce which uses exo-open to launch a file. but for some reason it defaults to xterm.
Sep 09 12:07:06 <ManDay>	Polynomial-C: If that were so, wouldn't `emerge gst-plugins-vaapi` also resort to ::gentoo?
Sep 09 12:07:10 <lg188>	I'm using `/usr/bin/kitty "%s"` as the command to replace it (in the GUI)
Sep 09 12:07:27 <lg188>	but for some reason it defaults to the wrong emulator
Sep 09 12:08:04 <lg188>	I can get it to run just fine with `exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator`
Sep 09 12:08:13 <lg188>	but the moment I add a file, it bugs out
Sep 09 12:18:41 <spacedust>	can i set up /etc/conf.d/net to use dhcp for an interface but leave ipv6 out ?
Sep 09 12:18:48 <spacedust>	i dont want it to configure a ipv6
Sep 09 12:21:16 <yabobay>	is it possible to install gentoo with only one partition? im using MBR, and i wont be doing Swap partition
Sep 09 12:21:28 <DrEeevil>	mostly yes
Sep 09 12:21:35 <DrEeevil>	as long as your bootloader can find a kernel ...
Sep 09 12:22:01 <yabobay>	because on the handbook it says i need multiple partitions to get a bootloader
Sep 09 12:24:19 <ManDay>	spacedust: Up to the configuration of your dhcp client, I'd say.
Sep 09 12:24:39 <ManDay>	dhcpcd, for instance, has "ipv4/6" config entries.
Sep 09 12:24:40 <spacedust>	ManDay: i see, where to set that ? is there a dhcp_ens3="-param" ?
Sep 09 12:24:55 <spacedust>	im not sure which one im using, for now i switch to static :)
Sep 09 12:24:57 <spacedust>	just rebooting
Sep 09 12:25:21 <spacedust>	aaaaah ipv6 its there ....
Sep 09 12:26:09 <spacedust>	nobody set it config_ens3="10.0.2.15/24" routes_ens3="default via 10.0.2.2"
Sep 09 12:26:25 <spacedust>	so if i dont explicitly say what ipv6 i want it will use dhcp ?
Sep 09 12:26:43 <spacedust>	ManDay: i am using dhcpcd
Sep 09 12:26:47 <ManDay>	can't parse your question
Sep 09 12:26:56 <spacedust>	or am i ? :) i have dhcp and dhcpcd package as well
Sep 09 12:27:02 <spacedust>	so now which one will netifrc use ?
Sep 09 12:27:18 <ManDay>	netifrc is a mystery to me...
Sep 09 12:28:02 <ManDay>	you can just try dhcpcd
Sep 09 12:29:15 <spacedust>	how ?
Sep 09 12:29:22 <spacedust>	how to set up dhcpcd to use only ipv4 ?
Sep 09 12:29:58 <ManDay>	I would *think* that dhcpcd.conf would help with that, but then again I'm not sure how netifrc invokes dhcpcd
Sep 09 12:30:19 <ManDay>	but I think dhcpcd.conf should at least be worth a try
Sep 09 12:31:27 <ManDay>	(i.e. noipv6)
Sep 09 12:31:55 <ManDay>	netifrc might still try to set up a linklocal adress, though
Sep 09 12:32:46 <spacedust>	/etc/conf.d/dhcpd:# DHCPD_OPTS=""
Sep 09 12:32:48 <spacedust>	-4
Sep 09 12:33:02 <spacedust>	/etc/conf.d/net:modules_ens3="dhcpcd"
Sep 09 12:33:07 <ManDay>	yeah, then there are these conf.d entries...
Sep 09 12:33:08 <BtbN>	dhcpcd is not responsible for IPv6. The Kernel takes care of that on its own mostly.
Sep 09 12:33:25 <spacedust>	crossing fingers, rebooting :)
Sep 09 12:33:52 <spacedust>	BtbN: well i definitly get a route, so im 100% sure the kernel does not get a route by itself so its dhcp doing that im sure
Sep 09 12:34:05 <BtbN>	It totaly is able to get a route on its own, yes.
Sep 09 12:34:08 <ManDay>	spacedust: never underestimate the kernel features :-D
Sep 09 12:34:12 <BtbN>	IPv6 does not need DHCP for that
Sep 09 12:34:21 <BtbN>	It doesn't need DHCP at all, actually.
Sep 09 12:34:25 <ManDay>	just read menuconfig for an idea of v6-features
Sep 09 12:34:27 <BtbN>	RA handles everything it needs.
Sep 09 12:34:33 <spacedust>	BtbN: oh cool :) i forget how many cool features ipv6 has :)
Sep 09 12:34:55 <BtbN>	I think the only thing the Kernel can't do entirely on its own is setting DNS servers, but that's about it.
Sep 09 12:34:59 <spacedust>	BtbN: so how to tell not to do it, i want to set up ipv6 later but want ipv4 via dhcp or static
Sep 09 12:35:34 <spacedust>	BtbN: indeed its not dhcpcd i just rebooted with the -4 setting and the rest and still getting ipv6 :)
Sep 09 12:35:57 <Kangie>	spacedust, take ipv6 out of your kernel?
Sep 09 12:36:20 <BtbN>	There's a sysctl setting to turn off RA on an interface
Sep 09 12:36:24 <BtbN>	But why do you even want that?
Sep 09 12:36:26 <ManDay>	Kangie: he said he wants to set it up later
Sep 09 12:37:12 <Kangie>	Fair.
Sep 09 12:44:58 <cihancan>	hi iamben
Sep 09 12:51:16 <Kangie>	Hi cihancan. What can we help you with?
Sep 09 12:58:35 <cihancan>	Kangie: hi man thx for asking ive no problems anymore i tried a 3rd install and everything went without problems
Sep 09 12:58:51 <Kangie>	Good to hear.
Sep 09 12:59:14 <cihancan>	i downloaded stage3 tarball from main gentoo server maybe that was the cause because whenever i use turkish gentoo servers i face a problem
Sep 09 12:59:25 <cihancan>	i will no more use turkish mirrors for anything again
Sep 09 13:02:04 <cihancan>	still gentoo has the least bugs i tried many distros on this laptop most of them worked so bad
Sep 09 13:02:57 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 09 13:04:32 <Kangie>	that's good cihancan.
Sep 09 13:05:58 <cihancan>	and support on this channel is awesome
Sep 09 13:08:49 <spacedust>	Kangie: no i cant i need it, but want it not to be set by default
Sep 09 13:08:59 <spacedust>	BtbN: maybe i need to turn off RA yes
Sep 09 13:09:06 <spacedust>	BtbN: can that make things complicated later ?
Sep 09 13:09:24 <spacedust>	BtbN: i want to remove the ipv6 i have now and add a ipv6 over ipv4 tunnel :)
Sep 09 13:09:39 <spacedust>	why ? :) cause its more complex and more messy :D yes tahts why :D and im also stupid thats why :D lol
Sep 09 13:10:41 <spacedust>	sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth1.autoconf=0
Sep 09 13:10:41 <spacedust>	sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.eth1.accept_ra=0
Sep 09 13:10:44 <spacedust>	found it thanks BtbN
Sep 09 13:11:11 <cihancan>	i realized that systemd is boots very fast on a barebone system but if you add a few simple services boot times drop drastically, imo openrc is more usable than systemd
Sep 09 13:11:44 <ratrace>	nah
Sep 09 13:11:53 <spacedust>	cihancan: OpenRC ftw :D
Sep 09 13:12:12 <spacedust>	so easy to set up a openrc enabled chroot on my phone :D hehe systemD ... bleeeeaaaah
Sep 09 13:13:28 <spacedust>	aaaaand adding those to my sysctl.conf + reboot = not helpin :( still getting ipv6 addresses somehow
Sep 09 13:14:03 <redsh>	spacedust: Do these addresses happen to start with fd?
Sep 09 13:14:10 <spacedust>	yes
Sep 09 13:14:13 <kerframil>	all IPv6 links have a link-local address.
Sep 09 13:14:14 <spacedust>	no
Sep 09 13:14:20 <spacedust>	        inet6 fe80::143c:cf6:bdcd:4dc8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
Sep 09 13:14:21 <spacedust>	        inet6 fec0::df21:66b2:948:d387  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x40<site>
Sep 09 13:14:27 <redsh>	Those are fine too.
Sep 09 13:14:28 <ryao>	spacedust: Wait... you want to disable IPv6?
Sep 09 13:14:31 <spacedust>	default via fe80::2 dev ens3 proto ra metric 202 pref medium
Sep 09 13:14:34 <spacedust>	no
Sep 09 13:14:37 <redsh>	They're not globally routable.
Sep 09 13:14:40 <ryao>	I just read the backlog. Nevermind.
Sep 09 13:14:50 <spacedust>	but i do have ipv6 and can access ipv6 sites
Sep 09 13:14:54 <spacedust>	and i also have a default route
Sep 09 13:14:56 <spacedust>	this is a kvm vm
Sep 09 13:15:11 <spacedust>	ryao: i want to disable the automatic configuration
Sep 09 13:15:18 <redsh>	... Really? NAT on IPv6?
Sep 09 13:15:20 <ryao>	spacedust: I thought fe addresses were link local addresses. IPv6 is a bit weird in how it assigns addresses.
Sep 09 13:15:21 <spacedust>	ryao: and then i want to add a ipv6 tunnel
Sep 09 13:15:29 <grawity>	probably just prefix translation
Sep 09 13:15:38 <grawity>	ryao: fe80 is link-local, other fe* are not necessarily
Sep 09 13:15:40 <spacedust>	i can now manually delete these
Sep 09 13:16:02 <ryao>	spacedust: grawity It says site in his example. I am not familiarw ith that one.
Sep 09 13:16:08 <ryao>	spacedust: I meant that for grawity.
Sep 09 13:16:16 <grawity>	fec* is the (now obsolete) "site local" range, and ... it doesn't get assigned by the host itself, it has to be assigned via config or via RAs just like global addresses
Sep 09 13:16:19 <redsh>	spacedust: And i.e `curl v6.ident.me` works and shows you your IPv6 address?
Sep 09 13:16:46 <freakynl>	Some people, incorrectly, seem to think that NAT is the firewall. It's the stateful inspection part that's the firewall (and yes, that can apply NAT, but it's not necessary for the stateful part at all). Just get a stateful firewall and route IPv6, using NAT on it is riduculous.
Sep 09 13:17:33 <spacedust>	ff00::/8 dev ens3 metric 256 pref medium
Sep 09 13:17:33 <spacedust>	ff00::/8 dev wg0 metric 256 pref medium
Sep 09 13:17:34 <grawity>	sadly, 1:1 NAT is one of the few actually usable approaches to handling dynamic prefixes
Sep 09 13:17:42 <spacedust>	so now im left with these only, these are link local right ?
Sep 09 13:17:44 <grawity>	no
Sep 09 13:17:47 <grawity>	they're multicast
Sep 09 13:17:50 <spacedust>	i should leave those or delete ?
Sep 09 13:17:56 <spacedust>	i never set ipv6 for wg0 wireguard
Sep 09 13:18:06 <grawity>	are you looking at the 'local' table?
Sep 09 13:18:08 <redsh>	freakynl: Well, if you you don't have globally routable IPv6 addresses, but do have IPv6 connectivity, then it sounds like IPv6 NAT to me.
Sep 09 13:18:16 <cihancan>	Kangie: have you played divinity original sin? it has a native linux client
Sep 09 13:18:16 <spacedust>	grawity: ip looking at ip -6 r
Sep 09 13:18:19 <grawity>	yes
Sep 09 13:18:19 <freakynl>	I assign my servers static IPv6 addresses
Sep 09 13:18:22 <spacedust>	redsh: i jsut deleted the routes and ips :)
Sep 09 13:18:25 <grawity>	you practically never need to delete anything from the 'local' table, treat it as the kernel's realm
Sep 09 13:18:32 <spacedust>	hm ?
Sep 09 13:18:34 <freakynl>	redsh: Really? Sounds like it's using IPv4 to reach the internet to me then ;)
Sep 09 13:18:37 <spacedust>	which is the local table ?
Sep 09 13:18:40 <spacedust>	ip -6 r ?
Sep 09 13:18:47 <grawity>	normally `ip -6 r` shows the 'main' table
Sep 09 13:18:49 <redsh>	freakynl: That's why I asked him about v6.ident.me
Sep 09 13:18:55 <grawity>	while `ip -6 r ls table all` shows all of them
Sep 09 13:18:58 <spacedust>	redsh: i cant now cause i delete the routes and ips wait a bit
Sep 09 13:19:04 <redsh>	spacedust: Well, if they appeared after a reboot, then they might appear again after another one.
Sep 09 13:19:10 <spacedust>	yes
Sep 09 13:19:14 <grawity>	the ff00::/8 routes I would expect only in 'table local' but not in main
Sep 09 13:19:15 <spacedust>	i will reboot soon and test that
Sep 09 13:19:22 <spacedust>	redsh: i could access ipv6.google.com with links
Sep 09 13:19:24 <grawity>	maybe your network configurator copies them there, idk
Sep 09 13:19:31 <spacedust>	local ::1 dev lo proto kernel metric 0 pref medium
Sep 09 13:19:31 <spacedust>	ff00::/8 dev ens3 metric 256 pref medium
Sep 09 13:19:31 <spacedust>	ff00::/8 dev wg0 metric 256 pref medium
Sep 09 13:20:03 <grawity>	either way, having a ff00::/8 route is normal, even if it's in the wrong table for some reason
Sep 09 13:20:10 <redsh>	Well, ipv6.google.com doesn't appear to have any IPv4 addresses, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Sep 09 13:23:06 <spacedust>	well tunnel does not work due to either kvm or firewall not allowing ipv6 over ipv4 tunnels
Sep 09 13:23:33 <spacedust>	redsh: yes curl gives back ipv6 address
Sep 09 13:23:36 <grawity>	anyway, sysctls... one common problem is that the boot process loads sysctl.conf *before* eth1 actually shows up, so net.ipv6.conf.all or net.ipv6.conf.default would work, but net.ipv6.conf.eth1 just isn't there yet
Sep 09 13:23:37 <spacedust>	so NAT :D
Sep 09 13:23:45 <ryao>	spacedust: Maybe you need to enable ip forwarding support.
Sep 09 13:23:57 <spacedust>	ryao: i dont have administrative rights :)
Sep 09 13:24:22 <spacedust>	ryao: you still working on zfs on linux ? i remember you from there, great help
Sep 09 13:24:25 <spacedust>	ryao++
Sep 09 13:24:36 <ryao>	spacedust: Thanks and I should have some things in the pipeline for that.
Sep 09 13:24:44 <ryao>	spacedust: What is the difference between root and administrative privileges?
Sep 09 13:24:56 <spacedust>	nothing :D
Sep 09 13:25:14 <spacedust>	whoami = notroot :)
Sep 09 13:25:33 <ryao>	spacedust: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Sep 09 13:25:57 <ryao>	That *might* be needed.
Sep 09 13:26:18 <spacedust>	ryao: negative :) admin set it to 0 :) # Disables packet forwarding
Sep 09 13:26:18 <spacedust>	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
Sep 09 13:26:25 <spacedust>	so thats why my tunnel isnt working
Sep 09 13:26:33 <spacedust>	btw i should had even asked before doing it :)
Sep 09 13:27:11 <grawity>	if this machine is a tunnel endpoint, it shouldn't matter
Sep 09 13:27:30 <spacedust>	no the machine is a kvm vm on the host that has the ip set for the tunnel endpoint
Sep 09 13:27:37 <grawity>	ah
Sep 09 13:27:47 <spacedust>	but im using my own local ip of the vm in the setup of the tunnel, but as ryao stated i probably need forwarding
Sep 09 13:28:16 <spacedust>	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
Sep 09 13:28:20 <grawity>	ah, host has public IPv4 address, VM has private IPv4 address, you need the VM to be tunnel endpoint?
Sep 09 13:28:21 <spacedust>	i have this on the vm but its not enough
Sep 09 13:28:33 <spacedust>	grawity: yes
Sep 09 13:28:36 <grawity>	of course it's not, because it's on the wrong machine
Sep 09 13:28:43 <spacedust>	huh ?
Sep 09 13:28:46 <spacedust>	it should work
Sep 09 13:28:54 <grawity>	but the VM isn't doing packet forwarding, is it
Sep 09 13:29:03 <spacedust>	the host isnt doing it
Sep 09 13:29:06 <spacedust>	the vm is doing it
Sep 09 13:29:25 <grawity>	hold on, where is the VM forwarding packets to/from?
Sep 09 13:29:43 <spacedust>	i have tried this on a virtualbox windows host with a linux guest and works without issues, indeed i had bridge the vm not nated ... hmmm
Sep 09 13:30:11 <spacedust>	it has fowarding enabled but its not forwarding anything anywhere
Sep 09 13:30:26 <grawity>	ok, where is the VM *supposed to* forward packets to/from
Sep 09 13:30:52 <spacedust>	it just enabled its not supposed to forward anything anywhere i guess for this to work
Sep 09 13:30:55 <spacedust>	am i wrong ?
Sep 09 13:31:01 <spacedust>	you confused the heck out of me now :D
Sep 09 13:31:13 <grawity>	this entire discussion is quite confusing
Sep 09 13:31:25 <grawity>	but yes I do have a feeling that the ip_forward option is completley useless on the V
Sep 09 13:31:31 <spacedust>	lets drop the topic and return to gentoo topic :) before i get a warning from an op for being offtopic :)
Sep 09 13:31:58 <spacedust>	grawity: might be useless now, but i have a wireguard tunnel so it could be very much usable if i wanted to :)
Sep 09 13:35:35 <ryao>	spacedust: It is just a guess. I have had issues with that disabled in the past. It is the default.
Sep 09 13:36:16 <ryao>	spacedust: If your VM is doing NAT, then enabling that on it probably isn't needed. Wait.. what kind of tunnel is this? If it the HE tunnel broker, then it cannot be behind NAT.
Sep 09 13:36:30 <grawity>	so if the VM is behind NAT (e.g. the host is NATing), then the host needs a DNAT rule for this
Sep 09 13:36:44 <grawity>	(I almost said "port forwarding rule" but technically this thing has no ports, it's just protocol 41)
Sep 09 13:44:23 <spacedust>	ryao: it can be behind nat, it is HE tunnel broker
Sep 09 13:44:48 <spacedust>	ryao: i have another place where i tried it, router does ipv4 only <NAT> <vm-bridge to NAT>
Sep 09 13:45:03 <spacedust>	here is different a bit its just the host doing the nat for the vm
Sep 09 13:45:23 <spacedust>	i guess something its blocking it, either a firewall or this forwarding setting or something
Sep 09 13:45:26 <grawity>	do you have control of the host's iptables rules?
Sep 09 13:45:42 <spacedust>	HE tunnel broker definitly works behind nat, you just change the local ip to the lan ip
Sep 09 13:45:44 <grawity>	and, well, use tcpdump and investigate instead of guessing
Sep 09 13:45:54 <spacedust>	grawity: nope :) waiting for the admin to be around
Sep 09 13:46:22 <grawity>	if the host is NATing your regular TCP and UDP traffic, that should mean its IP-forward settings are just fine
Sep 09 13:46:29 <grawity>	since it's the same setting that covers everything
Sep 09 13:46:37 <spacedust>	grawity: i didnt needed no DNAT rule on the host place
Sep 09 13:46:48 <grawity>	there's no separate "forward proto41 tunnel" sysctl, aside from iptables rules
Sep 09 13:46:50 *	ChanServ gives voice to Polynomial-C
Sep 09 13:47:08 <spacedust>	then its blocked by firewall thats all
Sep 09 13:47:35 <spacedust>	or im doing something wrong :) anyways ill drop this topic for now, thanks for all the information
Sep 09 14:19:32 <ryao>	spacedust: I have never gotten the HE tunnel broker working behind a NAT. Not all NATs support operating on things other than UDP or TCP.
Sep 09 14:21:08 <spacedust>	ryao: i just thought about something, maybe i cant set up a HE tunnel cause the host already has native ipv6 ?
Sep 09 14:21:33 <redsh>	No, it's probably because you aren't forwarding protocol 41.
Sep 09 14:21:36 <ryao>	spacedust: That shouldn't affect it. It might affect default routes.
Sep 09 14:21:38 <grawity>	ryao: most Linux-based ones do, since it doesn't even involve a protocol module... it's unfortunate that most routers don't expose it in the UI for configuring static rules though
Sep 09 14:21:58 <spacedust>	ryao: the one i got it working behind NAT is behind a cheap cheap soho router and on a windows 7 host in a debian vm guest :) debian vm is on the same subnet as windows host ... bridge mode
Sep 09 14:21:59 <grawity>	otoh if you have two hosts behind the same NAT both trying to use a tunnel, then you have trouble no matter what
Sep 09 14:21:59 <ryao>	spacedust: What redsh said about protocol 41. I had that issue when I tried doing a DMZ with double NAT routers once.
Sep 09 14:22:16 <spacedust>	ryao: thats why i wanted to delete all ipv6 addr and route on the guest vm
Sep 09 14:22:22 <grawity>	spacedust: no, that's nonsense
Sep 09 14:22:31 <spacedust>	grawity: its not exposed on the UI but it works
Sep 09 14:22:50 <grawity>	spacedust: but it *might be* that your tunnel is working fine but the "default" default route points to native v6
Sep 09 14:22:57 <spacedust>	and of course i stopped the vm and then the host :) so i cant remotely work on it :) wanted to do a restart :) duhhh
Sep 09 14:23:12 <spacedust>	grawity: default route of what ?
Sep 09 14:23:30 <spacedust>	default ipv6 route on the gues after starting tunnel is the one that should be
Sep 09 14:23:37 <spacedust>	and its the only route for ipv6 defaul
Sep 09 14:23:44 <spacedust>	as is the default :D
Sep 09 14:24:02 <grawity>	ok then "host already has native ipv6" has nothing to do with it whatsoever
Sep 09 14:24:16 <spacedust>	okay
Sep 09 14:24:19 <spacedust>	was just a touhhgt
Sep 09 14:25:55 <grawity>	from the host's perspective, the tunnel is just some stuff carried in ipv4 packets
Sep 09 14:38:49 <spacedust>	fe80::/10 – Link-Local Addresses, used on the internal network (IPv4 alternative: 169.254.0.0/16)
Sep 09 14:39:34 <grawity>	aaaaand?
Sep 09 14:41:02 <spacedust>	http://dpaste.com/0GHGSJJ
Sep 09 14:41:09 <spacedust>	http://dpaste.com/0SBC44F
Sep 09 14:41:20 <spacedust>	so im using such an address to get to my NATing "device" right ?
Sep 09 14:41:57 <grawity>	no
Sep 09 14:42:30 <grawity>	you are using a 'site-local' fec0:* address
Sep 09 14:42:51 <spacedust>	fe80Discovered open port 513/tcp on fe80::2
Sep 09 14:42:52 <spacedust>	hehe
Sep 09 14:47:43 <spacedust>	i am 100% a firewall setting is the culprit, nmap-ing via -6 and -4 gives different results, probably there are a ton of firewall rules limiting this :)
Sep 09 14:47:49 <spacedust>	and that is good :)
Sep 09 14:48:33 <spacedust>	recently i discovered that my ISP modem can not set the firewall level , i was able to 1-2 years ago, now it wont let me change the settings ... its ipv4 only and dhcp over adsl
Sep 09 14:48:43 <spacedust>	pppoe
Sep 09 14:49:36 <spacedust>	should get a proper router there and set it in bridged and let the router behind it handle everything
Sep 09 14:51:48 <spacedust>	it could probably work but since the ip isnt pingable HE wont allow it
Sep 09 14:52:45 <spacedust>	so my option is to make a tunnel elsewhere and share is via wireguard :D routeable even
Sep 09 14:52:50 <spacedust>	its neat
Sep 09 14:53:22 <spacedust>	ipv6 over wireguard over ipv4 everywhere :)
Sep 09 14:53:28 <spacedust>	yet to try it on android ...
Sep 09 14:53:45 <spacedust>	and since i shutdown my "server" vm's host ... i cant test ... duhh
Sep 09 14:53:59 <spacedust>	and i shouldnt drink so much coffee probably :D
Sep 09 14:54:25 <spacedust>	well time to set up a tunnel elsewhere :)
Sep 09 14:56:47 *	wokko passes spacedust a shovel to dig the tunnel

Sep 09 15:23:10 <MJaoune>	Is anyone using Gentoo with an SSD? Does it harm its lifespan (The way portage works I mean)? Are there any steps I need to do if I use an SSD on gentoo?
Sep 09 15:24:05 <hijacker>	MJaoune, portage build dir is in ramfs for me
Sep 09 15:24:19 <lg188>	MJaoune: I'd say to not update too much.
Sep 09 15:24:34 <groepaz__>	you will want to buy a new computer before it becomes a problem
Sep 09 15:26:57 <fiesh>	we have gentoo on an raidz1 on 4 ssds here, it would be the lulz if the hard disks couldn't handle the periodic once-per-day rsync...
Sep 09 15:27:02 <fiesh>	on a
Sep 09 15:28:22 <satmd>	I update almost daily, no wear noticed yet - and yes, ramdisk for /var/tmp/portage
Sep 09 15:30:49 <DrEeevil>	MJaoune: modern SSDs have a pretty long lifespan
Sep 09 15:34:27 <grawity>	on that note, would be interesting if anyone has measured the effects of relatime / lazytime / noatime
Sep 09 15:34:50 <grawity>	I never saw the point of noatime, but someone asked in another channel today, so
Sep 09 15:35:03 <MJaoune>	I guess just mounting /var/tmp/portage to ramfs would cause no harm for the ssd, and it is just a precaution... Are there packages that would require more than 8GB of space to build? Firefox, chromium, llvm?
Sep 09 15:35:32 <satmd>	I chose 9gb - no chromium though
Sep 09 15:35:49 <satmd>	remember, that tmpfs does not use more ram than it really needs
Sep 09 15:35:57 <Kelsar>	MJaoune: haven't yet killed a SSD with /var/tmp/portage on it, unless those are really old ssds, you won't kill them with that
Sep 09 15:35:59 <satmd>	but... the compile will take up memory, too
Sep 09 15:37:15 <DrEeevil>	satmd: and remember that with memory pressure tmpfs goes to swap :D
Sep 09 15:37:55 <satmd>	regarding that, I have reserved a little bit of zram for swap
Sep 09 15:38:07 <satmd>	I have btrfs on raid, no place for regular swap (yet)
Sep 09 15:39:15 <DrEeevil>	ouch
Sep 09 15:39:28 <DrEeevil>	satmd: last time I tried zram it was slower than swap on regular harddisk
Sep 09 15:39:37 <DrEeevil>	I'm not sure if this does what you think it does
Sep 09 15:40:45 <satmd>	well, it allows me to catch a bit, when memory gets full, time to react
Sep 09 15:46:44 <cihancan>	is libglvnd working? why its use flag is masked?
Sep 09 15:47:55 <cihancan>	i need it working for nvidia optimus how to make it work?
Sep 09 15:53:46 <iamben>	cihancan: the as entry mentins bug 692170, it might be ready to unmask for adventurous users
Sep 09 15:53:49 <willikins>	iamben: https://bugs.gentoo.org/692170 "x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers: Add support for media-libs/libglvnd"; Gentoo Linux, Current packages; RESO, FIXE; hhfeuer:jer
Sep 09 15:54:07 <iamben>	you'd need to unmask the USE flag, and the package
Sep 09 15:59:49 <cihancan>	iamben: ok ill take a look
Sep 09 16:14:52 <systo>	So trying to boot a gentoo install dvd from refind using uefi boot. Is the livedvd-amd64-hardened-nomultilib-20170118.iso bios only?
Sep 09 16:16:29 <iamben>	systo: it should have UEFI support, but it's a bit outdated otherwise (other hw support)
Sep 09 16:16:52 <jmgb4>	Is the permission for /etc/shadow really supposed to be 400? Mine is 640 for some reason...
Sep 09 16:17:22 <systo>	iamben, I'm getting an invalid loader file error
Sep 09 16:17:59 <redsh>	jmgb4: I don't think it should matter much if it's owned by root:root anyway. Unless you happen to just let anyone in the root group.
Sep 09 16:18:02 <ratrace>	jmgb4: 640 is correct
Sep 09 16:18:11 <iamben>	systo: what are you pointing refind at?
Sep 09 16:18:48 <jmgb4>	redsh, Just digging through a vulnerability report, according to this report is should be 400, I didnt think that was correct. And no I dont let "anybody" as root or in the root group.
Sep 09 16:19:02 <redsh>	And it's root:root?
Sep 09 16:19:15 <systo>	Refind detects the usb, with caption "Boot Fallback boot loader from Gentoo-AMD6
Sep 09 16:19:29 <redsh>	It's 640 on my Gentoo and at least two Debians and 400 on at least one Debian.
Sep 09 16:19:57 <redsh>	Not that root generally pays attention to Unix file system permissions anyhow.
Sep 09 16:20:44 <jmgb4>	it is redsh
Sep 09 16:20:52 <redsh>	If you were letting processes run with the root group, then that'd be more of a worry for me.
Sep 09 16:20:58 <jmgb4>	Nah
Sep 09 16:21:05 <redsh>	Yeah, just saying that.
Sep 09 16:21:21 <jmgb4>	Yeah I am just responding so you understand I am not skipping over anything
Sep 09 16:21:29 <jmgb4>	I am surprised how many vulns are in w3m
Sep 09 16:21:47 <jmgb4>	I dont thikn I need it but am double checking before I nuke it
Sep 09 16:22:37 <systo>	jmbg4, wonder how v3m compaires to elinks on that front
Sep 09 16:23:39 <jmgb4>	systo, Not sure but I am install elinks and run the report again lol
Sep 09 16:23:56 <jmgb4>	I never fully trust these scans anyway, its just interesting but it did pull down like ~30 vulns and CVEs with w3m
Sep 09 16:25:23 <systo>	oh. I'm seeing 7 CVEs for elinks, but that's cve's only
Sep 09 16:28:51 <jmgb4>	I am surprised there are no kernel vulns but the way the kernels have been released (frequency) I am not very surprised I guess
Sep 09 17:10:11 <cihancan>	iamben: do you think can we resolve this?
Sep 09 17:10:14 <cihancan>	https://paste.ee/p/xD1Zv
Sep 09 17:10:57 <cihancan>	xorg-server still pulls eselect-opengl
Sep 09 17:11:04 <iamben>	cihancan: well it's asking you to add some package.* entries for a few things
Sep 09 17:11:43 <cihancan>	iamben: what about blocks?
Sep 09 17:12:15 <iamben>	well for one thing you haven't unmasked libglvnd on nvidia-drivers yet
Sep 09 17:12:54 <iamben>	im not sure if there's an xorg-server ebuild yet that doesn't need eselect-opengl
Sep 09 17:14:52 <cihancan>	iamben: what if i link you a overlay can you check that xorg-server version in there doesnt need eselect-opengl?
Sep 09 17:15:11 <cihancan>	iamben: https://github.com/LuoJinghua/gentoo-overlay
Sep 09 17:16:03 <iamben>	why do i need to check? you chck
Sep 09 17:16:24 <cihancan>	ok i checked ebuild
Sep 09 17:16:40 <cihancan>	there is no eselect-opengl in the ebuild
Sep 09 17:16:52 <cihancan>	iamben: how can i add that overlay?
Sep 09 17:17:05 <iamben>	via eselect-repository, or layman
Sep 09 17:17:55 <cihancan>	its not on the layman's repository list
Sep 09 17:18:04 <cihancan>	still can i add it with it? how?
Sep 09 17:18:10 <KuerbisKern>	Do I need pulseaudio for bluetooth audio?
Sep 09 17:18:38 <iamben>	cihancan: you could write your own repos.conf file for it
Sep 09 17:18:43 <grawity>	KuerbisKern: maybe not technically, but it seems like it'll do *a lot* of work for you
Sep 09 17:18:50 <HEX0>	KuerbisKern: tias
Sep 09 17:19:18 <cihancan>	iamben: really ive no idea how to do it
Sep 09 17:19:29 <KuerbisKern>	thanks
Sep 09 17:20:19 <iamben>	cihancan: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf#External_ebuild_repository
Sep 09 17:21:23 <iamben>	cihancan: note that this repo has "ljh" in its repo_name file, so you shoulduse [ljh] as teh header in the repos.conf entry
Sep 09 17:24:22 <cihancan>	iamben: then emerge --sync?
Sep 09 17:24:52 <iamben>	yes, or just emerge --sync ljh (to not sync gentoo or other repos again)
Sep 09 17:26:34 <cihancan>	iamben: ok now when i emerge xorg-server overlay one is preferred?
Sep 09 17:26:58 <iamben>	by default, yes
Sep 09 17:27:05 <cihancan>	ok lets try ty
Sep 09 17:27:09 <iamben>	if you want to be sure, you can "emerge -av xorg-server::ljh"
Sep 09 17:30:25 <cihancan>	iamben: nvidia-drivers from this guys overlay still pulls eselect opengl
Sep 09 17:30:43 <cihancan>	i guess its impossible to use glvnd for now?
Sep 09 17:30:50 <iamben>	on your last paste, you hadn't unmasked the flag on nvidia-drivers yet
Sep 09 17:30:58 <cihancan>	hmm
Sep 09 17:31:11 <cihancan>	thanks for pointing that
Sep 09 17:33:15 <cihancan>	iamben: its ok its emerging now
Sep 09 17:33:29 <cihancan>	youre the hero
Sep 09 17:33:43 <iamben>	i have no idea if glvnd will actually work
Sep 09 17:33:59 <cihancan>	iamben: i will help with that
Sep 09 17:34:08 <cihancan>	i hope it works
Sep 09 17:40:01 <cihancan>	iamben: how it works on other distributions? is libglvnd enabled on them or they use a different method?
Sep 09 17:40:05 <pylsan>	I get a wierd text flood from portage when syncing "For compatibility with <=portage-2.1.6.7, only call EXPORT_FUNCTIONS after inherit(s)."

Sep 09 18:30:27 <grknight>	mark4: seems like an overlay has one.. but I cannot vouch for quality
Sep 09 18:31:00 <pylsan>	grknight: yes kernel-2.eclass , is there anything to do with it
Sep 09 18:31:43 <mark4>	grknight, is there a wish list bug report "i would love to see an ebuild for kotlin blah blah" ?
Sep 09 18:32:35 <iamben>	mark4: you can open such a report, but it's unlikely anyone's going to do anything unless they already had plans to do so
Sep 09 18:32:40 <iterati>	Let's say I want to install Gentoo alongside another linux distro. On a different partition. Then after I make sure all work, going to erase the old linux and move gentoo into that. Should I use the existing grub and boot partition ?
Sep 09 18:32:41 <iamben>	as far as official devs, anyway
Sep 09 18:32:54 <iamben>	a bug report can be helpful for users to collaborate on a new build

Sep 09 19:09:09 <zChris>	Alright seems that my gentoo-sources 4.19.52 have been purged. Not sure when i did that. Can it happen if you do uDu update ?
Sep 09 19:09:32 <iamben>	zChris: no, but depclean can do that
Sep 09 19:09:46 <iamben>	you should think about getting a newer 4.19.x kernel, .52 is old and crusty
Sep 09 19:10:15 <zChris>	iamben: Well i have 4.19.66 but i cant rebuild nvidia-drivers
Sep 09 19:10:44 <iamben>	zChris: did you build & boot 4.19.66 yet?
Sep 09 19:11:12 <zChris>	hmm ah i didnt do grub-mkconfig it seems since im on 19.52 still
Sep 09 19:29:24 <systo>	jmgb4, what the vuln say about elinks?

Sep 09 19:51:26 <West77>	Hi everyone, I just did a fresh install of  Gentoo. Upon rebooting my keyboard and mouse do not work or they seem to not even be detected (no power). This is what my make.conf looks like.  https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1101670.html
Sep 09 19:52:00 <West77>	Xorg and the drivers have already been installed
Sep 09 19:52:23 <iamben>	West77: do they work in tty?
Sep 09 19:52:48 <grknight>	West77: how did you create your kernel? did you forget to build the USB Host controller driver?
Sep 09 19:53:07 <West77>	I will double check on that right now
Sep 09 19:53:17 <West77>	It was done manually
Sep 09 19:54:49 <grknight>	West77: also make sure that USB HID (Human Interface Device) is enabled
Sep 09 19:55:08 <grknight>	or perhaps Human Input Device
Sep 09 19:59:53 <West77>	Both are enabled
Sep 09 20:01:08 <West77>	Could it be an issue with xorg?
Sep 09 20:01:24 <grknight>	is this OpenRC or systemd?
Sep 09 20:01:37 <iamben>	West77: do they work in tty?
Sep 09 20:02:56 <West77>	no it does not. I am stuck in the login screen and I am unable to login
Sep 09 20:03:02 <Necktwi>	what should eselcet opengl set for virtualbox guest?
Sep 09 20:03:19 <grknight>	Necktwi: xorg-x11
Sep 09 20:03:30 <Necktwi>	thank you
Sep 09 20:03:44 <iamben>	West77: tty login screen or a gui login manager?
Sep 09 20:03:54 <West77>	tty login screen
Sep 09 20:04:13 <iamben>	West77: then xorg isnt involved, this is a kernel config problem.  can you use wgetpaste to share your kernel .config ?
Sep 09 20:05:24 <West77>	I will try. I am using the gentoo minimal live cd at the moment
Sep 09 20:05:39 <grknight>	the minimal includes wgetpaste outside the chroot

Sep 09 20:11:22 <West77>	thank you!
Sep 09 20:11:40 <_Cute_Kitty_>	also should I use owncloud or samba to share files on my server machine with any other machine
Sep 09 20:12:30 <dalu>	iamben, this log won't help you, the files are deleted, but portage still refuses to install the package

Sep 09 20:15:11 <dalu>	never mind, I `rm -rf /lib/systemd`
Sep 09 20:16:09 <West77>	grknight they are both razer branded
Sep 09 20:16:28 <West77>	the mouse and the keyboard

Sep 09 20:18:00 <_Cute_Kitty_>	nevermind i got it
Sep 09 20:18:02 <_Cute_Kitty_>	thanks :)
Sep 09 20:18:06 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so, owncloud or samba
Sep 09 20:18:31 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I need to access all the files i have stored from any other computer anywhere,  so samba may be out of the question
Sep 09 20:18:32 <grknight>	up to you
Sep 09 20:18:48 <_Cute_Kitty_>	what do people around here think of Owncloud? do any of you use it
Sep 09 20:19:18 <grknight>	that's not on topic here
Sep 09 20:19:45 <earendil>	VPN will allow you to use CIFS reasonably well
Sep 09 20:19:57 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok. well i have another question then. what about this https://mrs0m30n3.github.io/youtube-dl-gui/#downloads .... I'm trying to download it on gentoo, and i think the easiest way is to use python pip to download it.
Sep 09 20:20:15 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but pip install youtube-dlg won't install it
Sep 09 20:20:53 <grknight>	you're not allowed to use pip to install on Gentoo as it breaks stuff (as root);  you can add the --user switch to allow pip to install to a user
Sep 09 20:21:13 <_Cute_Kitty_>	dpaste.com/1CBBMHG i was getting to that
Sep 09 20:21:23 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i ran the command with --user but it gives me the errors listed in that text
Sep 09 20:21:37 <_Cute_Kitty_>	I don't have a ton of experience with python so maybe one of you could help me with understanding the error?
Sep 09 20:22:13 <grknight>	try putting EPYTHON="python2.7"  before pip.. your app does not support the default of python 3.6
Sep 09 20:23:06 <_Cute_Kitty_>	http://dpaste.com/3ABKYCJ
Sep 09 20:23:34 <grknight>	yeah, you're in a mess of dep issues now
Sep 09 20:23:41 <_Cute_Kitty_>	can you explain that
Sep 09 20:24:05 <grknight>	you'll need the correct version of wxpython
Sep 09 20:24:07 <mroh>	net-misc/youtube-dl-gui is in several "official" overlays ...
Sep 09 20:25:28 <grknight>	West77: I don't see anything missing.. but perhaps someone else will
Sep 09 20:25:38 <UndrWater>	i'm getting a mariadb / openssl block: http://dpaste.com/1QP21NP
Sep 09 20:26:02 <West77>	grknight thank you for looking into it :]
Sep 09 20:26:27 <BadBob>	Hi - when building gmp (required by openoffice) - initial compilation succeeds, but then emerge dies with "ninja: error: unknown target 'install'"
Sep 09 20:26:29 <iamben>	UndrWater: are you masking new mariadb?
Sep 09 20:26:39 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok. well i have the command line youtubedl so that will be enough. another question. my dvd detects dvds and lists them on desktop but when i try to play them in vlc it does nothing, clicking on the dvd in file mangaer says "operationon not permitted" and makemkv says there are no optical drives found.
Sep 09 20:26:45 <iamben>	BadBob: known bug, drop back one version (you mean glm, not gmp)
Sep 09 20:26:46 <UndrWater>	iamben: hang on
Sep 09 20:27:01 <iamben>	West77: can you pastebin dmesg output from the installcd where kb/mouse work?
Sep 09 20:27:08 <BadBob>	iamben:  Yes, I meant glm... oops.  Thanks for the tip.
Sep 09 20:27:44 <iamben>	BadBob: it's only the latest ~arch one which is broken, you can drop back one version.  fyi when using full ~arch, you really should have bugs.gentoo.org bookmarked & handy.
Sep 09 20:28:04 <grknight>	_Cute_Kitty_: your user may need to be in the cdrom group to read such things
Sep 09 20:28:29 <iamben>	BadBob: oh and a fix was just committed seconds ago
Sep 09 20:28:34 <grknight>	_Cute_Kitty_: but if you are running elogind (or perhaps consolekit), that may not be necessary
Sep 09 20:28:35 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes, i think you're right. how do i add my user to cdrom
Sep 09 20:28:39 <UndrWater>	iamben: it appears i was.  I'm not sure why...i'm going to have to comment these things going further
Sep 09 20:28:53 <BadBob>	iamben:  absolutely.  thanks.  i took a quick look for an existing bug report but i failed to find it, sorry
Sep 09 20:29:10 <grknight>	_Cute_Kitty_: gpasswd -a <user> cdrom
Sep 09 20:29:55 <_Cute_Kitty_>	thank you
Sep 09 20:30:27 <mroh>	BadBob: 693928
Sep 09 20:30:48 <BadBob>	iamben:  perhaps because my brain is confusing glm and gmp.  sorry for the mixup
Sep 09 20:31:30 <West77>	iamben where is this file dmesg?
Sep 09 20:31:42 <West77>	thanks you for your patience
Sep 09 20:31:44 <iamben>	West77: wgetpaste -c "dmesg"         (it's a command which dumps kernel log)
Sep 09 20:31:51 <_Cute_Kitty_>	same error ,clicking on dvd says not authorized to open
Sep 09 20:33:29 <luke-jr>	What is the "security reason" paramiko is patched with "Disabled by Gentoo for security reasons. Enable with 'server' USE flag"?
Sep 09 20:33:52 <BadBob>	Cute_Kitty:  I think you need to start a new session before the group membership is seen
Sep 09 20:35:33 <iamben>	luke-jr: did you read the USE flag mask comments?
Sep 09 20:37:48 <grknight>	_Cute_Kitty_: did you logout and back in?
Sep 09 20:38:04 <_Cute_Kitty_>	no
Sep 09 20:38:28 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but I will now lol :)
Sep 09 20:46:40 <mark4>	does anyone here use the meld differencing / merging tool?
Sep 09 20:48:18 <BadBob>	mark4:  first time I've heard of it.
Sep 09 20:49:04 <mark4>	im editing its configs and have the config window open. thers no "save" button or "done" button. and none of the keys i press get out of the config editor :/
Sep 09 20:50:15 <luke-jr>	iamben: didn't realise it was, thanks
Sep 09 20:51:49 <BadBob>	mark4:  i never used meld before but i decided to try it.   looks like the preferences pops up a dialog.  if you just 'x' out of that dialog, looks like the prefs take effect.
Sep 09 20:52:27 <BadBob>	mark4:  I mean, looks like the prefs take effect immediately, no need to save or apply or anything
Sep 09 20:52:44 <mark4>	i mean. NO keypress i enter closes that window lol
Sep 09 20:52:58 <mark4>	theres no "im done with this stuff" button
Sep 09 20:53:07 <BadBob>	mark4:  the window manager exit button
Sep 09 20:54:14 <BadBob>	mark4:  is your window manager showing a frame for the preferences dialog?
Sep 09 20:54:18 <mark4>	sure i didnt mean to close that window
Sep 09 20:54:28 <systo>	hmm, is there a way to see if ZoL on this rescue cd supports a specific feature?
Sep 09 20:54:34 <mark4>	BadBob, define "frame" ?
Sep 09 20:54:46 <BadBob>	window manager decoration with icon, 'exit' button, etc
Sep 09 20:55:23 <BadBob>	mark4:  typically like 'resize' and 'close' buttons, and a title ...
Sep 09 20:56:00 <mark4>	no, none of the above on that window
Sep 09 20:56:28 <BadBob>	mark4:  then your window manager is not showing decorations for that popup.  what WM are you using?
Sep 09 20:57:08 <mark4>	cinnamon desktop
Sep 09 20:57:34 <zChris>	Do linux have virtual network interfaces when vpn is installed like windows? Not in use just installed
Sep 09 20:58:35 <BadBob>	mark4:   this is what I see:   https://pasteboard.co/IwEh6QD.jpg
Sep 09 20:58:52 <BadBob>	mark4:  i think it was a bit goofy of the application authors not to add an 'apply' or 'ok' or 'close' button
Sep 09 20:59:00 <mark4>	what wm?
Sep 09 20:59:04 <katana_web>	zChris, normally software like openVPN creates a tunnel device
Sep 09 20:59:06 <West77>	iamben http://dpaste.com/27ARKPD
Sep 09 20:59:08 <BadBob>	mark4:  but it looks like they were just counting on the window manager to provide a close button
Sep 09 20:59:11 <BadBob>	mark4:  this is enlightenment
Sep 09 20:59:19 <BadBob>	mark4:  sadly i know nothing about cinnamon
Sep 09 20:59:31 <mark4>	i installed that recently but have not switched to it
Sep 09 20:59:42 <BadBob>	mark4:  did you try hitting 'esc' in the config dialog ?
Sep 09 20:59:47 <mark4>	tried it many years ago but found too many bugs in it back them
Sep 09 20:59:50 <mark4>	yes tried that lol
Sep 09 20:59:57 <BadBob>	mark4:  somehow, it works here !
Sep 09 21:00:12 <BadBob>	mark4:  meld 3.20.1, just installed it
Sep 09 21:00:47 <BadBob>	mark4:  does cinnamon show old-style window decorations for any windows at all?  or does it hide all of them?
Sep 09 21:01:15 <mark4>	what do you mean by old style? thers a new style?
Sep 09 21:01:22 <mark4>	i get an X button etc on other windows just fine
Sep 09 21:01:27 <BadBob>	mark4:  new style is not to show them at all :)
Sep 09 21:01:54 <mark4>	and replace them with what?
Sep 09 21:02:00 <BadBob>	mark4:  ok, so somehow cinnamon treats this differently, probably because it's a modal dialog
Sep 09 21:02:06 <mark4>	im also not a fan of the whoe new fangled no title bar BS either
Sep 09 21:02:20 <BadBob>	mark4:  a lot of newer apps just hide the WM decoration and replace it with *nothing*.
Sep 09 21:02:32 <mark4>	cant shade a window if it has no title bar
Sep 09 21:02:46 <BadBob>	mark4:  i am not a fan of that style.  it's coming from the mobile world, I think
Sep 09 21:02:51 <BadBob>	mark4:  yeah, it kind of sucks
Sep 09 21:02:54 <mark4>	yup
Sep 09 21:03:08 <mark4>	but this is turning OT and the on topic police will bash us :)
Sep 09 21:04:02 <BadBob>	mark4:  well, i'm trying to help you find a solution
Sep 09 21:04:32 <BadBob>	mark4:  solution 1)   if cinnamon does not have a shortcut key for 'close window' (eg F4) you could bind one
Sep 09 21:04:35 <mark4>	yea im not sure there is one lol
Sep 09 21:04:55 <BadBob>	mark4:  solution 2:  find out why 'esc' does not work (I suspect the cinnamon WM is 'eating' the keystroke)
Sep 09 21:04:56 <mark4>	actually i always always always totally unbind ANY and all keypresses bound to the windowmanager
Sep 09 21:05:15 <mark4>	if it is its going to get ugly lol
Sep 09 21:05:21 <mark4>	ill look into that
Sep 09 21:05:36 <BadBob>	mark4:  solution 3:  learn how to stop Cinnamon from hiding the WM decoration (it's probably a configuration option)
Sep 09 21:05:44 <BadBob>	mark4:  solution 4:  change WM
Sep 09 21:06:05 <BadBob>	mark4:  solution 5:  add a  'close' button to the dialog, or petition the app author to do so
Sep 09 21:06:23 <West77>	iamben hi Ben. I see that  it shows the keyboard and the mouse when using that command. However this only when using chroot through the boot usb
Sep 09 21:10:11 <West77>	http://dpaste.com/27ARKPD
Sep 09 21:13:24 <katana_web>	zChris, the "virtiual" interface is can be called tun0, and it's a kernel device (your kernel' .config or /proc/config.gz needs: CONFIG_TUN set to either 'y' or 'm')
Sep 09 21:14:48 <iamben>	West77: have you only built one kernel ever, or have you been tweaking the config and rebuilding a few times?
Sep 09 21:15:16 <iamben>	tbh your config looks fine, i just wonder if the kernel you're currently *booting* hasnt been built with this newest good config
Sep 09 21:15:35 <West77>	iamben a few times due to going back and forth
Sep 09 21:16:10 <iamben>	West77: do you have another PC you can ssh in from, on a no-keyboard-no-mouse failed boot?
Sep 09 21:16:23 <iamben>	or maybe you can grab the /var/log/dmesg file from chroot
Sep 09 21:16:36 <iamben>	i'd be curious to see the dmesg output on a failed boot
Sep 09 21:18:05 <West77>	How do I grab that file?
Sep 09 21:18:17 <West77>	using chroot. Thanks again Ben
Sep 09 21:20:18 <iamben>	if you emerge wgetpaste inside chroot, then you can "wgetpaste /var/log/dmesg" from inside chroot
Sep 09 21:20:26 <iamben>	or from outside do wgetpaste /mnt/gentoo/var/log/dmesg
Sep 09 21:20:50 <palica>	can someone help me with this, I am trying to compile stuff inside docker and I am getting this error: https://pastebin.com/JPEuXDBd
Sep 09 21:21:28 <palica>	seems sandbox related, what capabilities is docker missing?
Sep 09 21:21:46 <West77>	iamben it's very odd, but I get the no such file found message
Sep 09 21:21:53 <West77>	From inside chroot
Sep 09 21:22:32 <iamben>	West77: do you boot via systemd or openrc on the new install?
Sep 09 21:22:46 <West77>	openrc
Sep 09 21:23:06 <iamben>	hmm then /var/log/dmesg should exist
Sep 09 21:24:17 <BadBob>	West77:  what's the last thing (non-error) message you see when you try to boot?
Sep 09 21:24:27 <West77>	iamben http://dpaste.com/2CHWT9E
Sep 09 21:24:53 <West77>	BadBob I'll checck right now
Sep 09 21:26:02 <iamben>	West77: in /etc/conf.d/bootmisc , is log_dmesg="YES" set (and uncommented)?
Sep 09 21:35:13 <BadBob>	iamben:  i think the /var/log/dmesg file only gets written after the filesystems are mounted, which might be after the boot failure.   bootmisc.conf says "Write the initial dmesg log into /var/log/dmesg after boot".  It's not getting written as the system boots.
Sep 09 21:36:03 <iamben>	BadBob: it's defnitely after the rootfs remount but his boot only "fails" in that he has no keyboard to login at tty1
Sep 09 21:36:16 <iamben>	so i think it should still be written, unless he also has rootfs/fstab issues on top of all this
Sep 09 21:36:17 <BadBob>	iamben:  OIC.  I thougt it was a completely failed boot, sorry
Sep 09 21:36:36 <iamben>	yeah my saying "failed boot" is a bit confusing
Sep 09 21:37:05 <BadBob>	iamben: no prob, I'm just trying (too hard maybe) to be helpful :)
Sep 09 21:37:13 <katana_web>	also curious that there was no /var/log/messages
Sep 09 21:38:14 <iamben>	messages is specifically a syslog-ng ism
Sep 09 21:38:43 <West77>	BadBob the last message I see is (non error) starting openrc-settingsd, and setting up lightdm.
Sep 09 21:39:06 <BadBob>	West77:  OK.  The  boot is succeeding, I was just confused
Sep 09 21:39:35 <West77>	I did however see a message rootfilesystem couldnt not be mounted read/write. Unable to resolve Label
Sep 09 21:39:43 <BadBob>	West77:  A-HA !!!
Sep 09 21:39:49 <iamben>	ok so it sounds like you do also have fstab issues
Sep 09 21:39:51 <West77>	iamben yes the log is on for dmesg
Sep 09 21:40:43 <BadBob>	West77:  you're not going to get too far without a working root filesystem
Sep 09 21:41:03 <iamben>	West77: can you share your fstab and "blkid" output?
Sep 09 21:43:17 <West77>	This is the fstab
Sep 09 21:43:28 <West77>	http://dpaste.com/29GRV6R
Sep 09 21:44:35 <West77>	http://dpaste.com/05PMJ2D
Sep 09 21:44:46 <katana_web>	what's the preferred for the rootfs... LABEL or UUID?
Sep 09 21:44:50 <BadBob>	West77:  see how the labels don't match?
Sep 09 21:45:16 <iamben>	West77: PARTLABEL vs LABEL
Sep 09 21:45:36 <West77>	it never dawned to me to look there
Sep 09 21:45:46 <West77>	lets see now :)
Sep 09 21:46:05 <iamben>	katana_web: yes, or PARTLABEL or PARTUUID (it's really just personal preference, for the most part)
Sep 09 21:46:33 <iamben>	i like PARTLABEL since they're readable by kernel & userspace & humans
Sep 09 21:47:39 <katana_web>	can you also pass them in kernel command line eg. root=PARTLABEL=rootfs ?
Sep 09 21:47:45 <iamben>	yep
Sep 09 21:48:12 <katana_web>	better not have multiple rootfs labels then ;)
Sep 09 21:49:09 <katana_web>	might only be an issue for a, say, longer lived install that has had drives added
Sep 09 21:49:34 <iamben>	yeah it's true that collisions are a lot more likely for labels than uuids =)
Sep 09 21:49:43 <katana_web>	and root migrated between them
Sep 09 21:49:49 <systo>	uugh, my ZFS root has one feature not available on Fearedbliss' zfs rescue CD
Sep 09 21:50:23 <systo>	Time to learn catalyst on another system
Sep 09 21:50:42 <lupus>	hello gentoomen. i had an old gentoo laptop with xfce4, where the screen got busted. for the past year it has just been serving as a headless teamspeak server. today i have been trying to scrub uneeded x11 stuff, but it's proven more difficult that i thought.
Sep 09 21:52:16 <iamben>	lupus: did you clean all the x11 stuffs out of /var/lib/portage/world then depclean?
Sep 09 21:52:54 <lupus>	i changed my profile from /17.0/desktop to /17.0/ emerge -c on everything i could see that was x11 related. i can't delete these packages: http://dpaste.com/2FM90Y4. my world file now looks like this: http://dpaste.com/2A6PHJ2
Sep 09 21:53:38 <iamben>	lupus: did you "emerge -uDNav @world" after the profile change?
Sep 09 21:53:52 <lupus>	iamben: i did not
Sep 09 21:54:12 <iamben>	you need to do that to apply all the USE changes, like -X etc
Sep 09 21:54:13 <redsh>	lupus: Do you have USE=x set in make.conf?
Sep 09 21:54:28 <iamben>	i think after you do that, depclean will offer to remove quite a lot of pkgs
Sep 09 21:55:05 <lupus>	iamben: i will try, thanks
Sep 09 22:04:06 <West77>	iamben upon rebooting I now enter a black screen. I feel we are getting close since I can see whats on the dmesg log
Sep 09 22:04:11 <West77>	http://dpaste.com/0SFG235
Sep 09 22:07:13 <iamben>	West77: what kind of gpu?
Sep 09 22:07:46 <West77>	2080TI from evga
Sep 09 22:08:48 <iamben>	have you added xdm to the default runlevel so that lightdm starts @ boot?
Sep 09 22:09:17 <West77>	yes I have
Sep 09 22:09:43 <iamben>	you might wanna remove xdm from the default runlevel until X is reliably working ... you can bypass xdm one-time by passing "nox" as a kernel param
Sep 09 22:10:45 <West77>	I'll remove it right now :)
Sep 09 22:11:37 <West77>	I'll reboot  now
Sep 09 22:16:13 <West77>	the keyboard and mouse are still not detected upon booting to the console terminal
Sep 09 22:17:35 <iamben>	but maybe /var/log/dmesg exists now?
Sep 09 22:18:01 <West77>	i'll check now
Sep 09 22:18:51 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 09 22:20:49 <katana_web>	iamben, wasn't this http://dpaste.com/0SFG235 the log/dmesg West77 posted earlier?
Sep 09 22:21:01 <iamben>	that's the livecd kernel, not his new kernel
Sep 09 22:21:07 <katana_web>	ah
Sep 09 22:22:01 <iamben>	hm or maybe it's not, my mistake
Sep 09 22:24:34 <West77>	http://dpaste.com/2ZRRG69
Sep 09 22:24:50 <West77>	This is the output from /mnt/gentoo/var/log/dmesg
Sep 09 22:25:18 <iamben>	West77: that's still kernel build #1, your first ever build of 4.19.66, from yesterday
Sep 09 22:25:33 <iamben>	are you sure you've been compiling & installing after the config tweaks?
Sep 09 22:26:14 <katana_web>	did you copy arch/.../bzImage to /boot or /boot/efi?
Sep 09 22:26:20 <iamben>	there's no mention of xhci in here, seems like this kernel still lacks XHCI_HCD support
Sep 09 22:26:35 <West77>	I am not sure. Any way to check this?
Sep 09 22:27:29 <iamben>	inside chroot, does "file /boot/vmlinuz-4.19.66" show #1 or some higher build number?
Sep 09 22:28:40 <grknight>	katana_web: you shouldn't ever copy that by hand to begin with
Sep 09 22:30:05 <West77>	http://dpaste.com/1B62NCK
Sep 09 22:30:19 <katana_web>	grknight, how do one install a kernel then...
Sep 09 22:30:23 <West77>	this whats in the boot folder
Sep 09 22:30:32 <grknight>	katana_web: 'make install'
Sep 09 22:30:51 <iamben>	West77: seems like you forgot to mount your split /boot partition
Sep 09 22:32:55 <West77>	iamben my apologizes http://dpaste.com/1SFBJ1C
Sep 09 22:33:34 <iamben>	so have you been forgetting to mount the /boot partition before each of these kernel rebuilds?
Sep 09 22:34:06 <iamben>	that might explain why you're still booting kernel #1 and you still don't have working USB
Sep 09 22:34:31 <West77>	Yeah I have. I was working on it late last night. Is my mistake fixable?
Sep 09 22:34:52 <iamben>	sure
Sep 09 22:35:26 <iamben>	i'd make sure /boot and /boot/efi are mounted up, then redo your kernel build+install, and grub-install, and grub-mkconfig
Sep 09 22:35:59 <West77>	sounds good. I'll start right now
Sep 09 22:36:08 <katana_web>	grknight, though I can't stand the name vmlinuz...
Sep 09 22:37:02 <grknight>	katana_web: no promises that "bzImage" works for everyone or for the future.  the make commands for the arch will ensure everything is built.  rename it later if you like
Sep 09 22:43:28 <katana_web>	I might be delusional but, seems fine to me http://dpaste.com/0B1SDH6
Sep 09 22:44:35 <iamben>	katana_web: you will use vmlinuz and you will like it
Sep 09 22:44:49 <jsubl2>	hehehe
Sep 09 22:45:02 <grknight>	can it work? yes.  does it work for all arches? no;  can it be changed to post-process or to a new name without warning? yes
Sep 09 22:46:47 <West77>	it finally works now :)
Sep 09 22:46:53 <katana_web>	I'm fine with that... and yes... I've had my share of kernel panics to teach me what to look for :)
Sep 09 22:50:13 <katana_web>	anyhow... any reason why no one's made an package that builds Visual Studio Code from source rather than pulling in the pre-build one?
Sep 09 22:50:44 <shinboi>	is it open source?
Sep 09 22:50:49 <katana_web>	yes...
Sep 09 22:51:17 <redsh>	I don't think there are a lot of ebuilds for Electron-based software.
Sep 09 22:51:24 <redsh>	That build them from source.
Sep 09 22:51:29 <katana_web>	shinboi it is MIT licensed
Sep 09 22:51:45 <redsh>	katana_web: Do you want to write one? :D
Sep 09 22:52:04 <grknight>	katana_web: maybe it was difficult and they didn't know how;  maybe it violates build policies/sandbox;  dunno really
Sep 09 22:52:28 <katana_web>	grknight, likely all of the above
Sep 09 22:53:21 <katana_web>	I haven't seen updated Electron ebuilds
Sep 09 22:54:10 <katana_web>	and trying to manually build it from source also seems daunting... but I'm not building electron apps normally either...
Sep 09 22:54:34 <katana_web>	*I'm normally not building
Sep 09 22:58:49 <lupus>	katana_web: i think it also might be a bin, but there is a foss version of visual studio code where all the telemetry is removed
Sep 09 22:59:25 <lupus>	https://gpo.zugaina.org/Search?search=vscodium
Sep 09 23:00:23 <lupus>	yea .. they are all bin. i'm using the one from jorgicio
Sep 09 23:00:56 <spare>	 /quit
Sep 09 23:02:51 <katana_web>	yeah... guess it's better to break a docker container than your gentoo installation ;)
Sep 09 23:03:30 <katana_web>	and I do have jorgicio's overlay... I might switch to that one
Sep 09 23:10:42 <mikejw>	hi, I'm trying to upgrade to kernel 4.19.66... I've merged from an old .config and built it but it crashes when I try to boot.. what's the best step forward to troubleshoot the new kernel?
Sep 09 23:12:33 <iamben>	mikejw: did you use genkernel or manual make?
Sep 09 23:12:40 <mikejw>	manual
Sep 09 23:13:12 <iamben>	was your previous/working kernel build manually also, or genkernel?
Sep 09 23:13:21 <mikejw>	manul also
Sep 09 23:13:50 <iamben>	what do you see on the screen when the new one fails? is it a panic?
Sep 09 23:14:58 <mikejw>	it looks like there are problems "mounting" devices and loading modules.. plus usb devices stop working.. and then there is a black screen with an underscore in the top corner :S
Sep 09 23:15:17 <iamben>	does it normally boot to a gui login manager?
Sep 09 23:15:29 <mikejw>	yep to lightdm, I belvieve
Sep 09 23:15:44 <mikejw>	*believe
Sep 09 23:16:00 <katana_web>	did you remember to: make modules_install
Sep 09 23:16:09 <mikejw>	yeah
Sep 09 23:16:52 <iamben>	it does kinda sound like you missed modules_install.  try booting with a "nox" kernel param so that lightdm doesn't start.
Sep 09 23:17:03 <iamben>	hopefully boot to tty will work and you can poke around a bit
Sep 09 23:17:17 <katana_web>	do you use nvidia-drivers ?
Sep 09 23:17:20 <mikejw>	I do
Sep 09 23:17:26 <katana_web>	might have to rebuild that too
Sep 09 23:18:03 <katana_web>	after setting your kernel version with eselect kernel set #
Sep 09 23:18:17 <mikejw>	I think I'm learning the hard way the perils of emerge --depclean
Sep 09 23:19:46 <mikejw>	I didn't realise it would deactivate old kernel sources
Sep 09 23:20:15 <iamben>	it will unless you add the old versions to world explicitly
Sep 09 23:21:11 <mikejw>	interesting
Sep 09 23:21:22 <mikejw>	is it worth doing a full emerge world while in the old kernel?
Sep 09 23:21:38 <iamben>	no
Sep 09 23:21:49 <mikejw>	ok
Sep 09 23:21:56 <mikejw>	brb
Sep 09 23:28:16 <mikejw>	hi, I'm back
Sep 09 23:28:43 <mikejw>	so now the new kernel boots into X fine but USB devices (mouse and keyboard) aren't working and in the old kernel it's the opposite :D
Sep 09 23:29:04 <iamben>	do the kb/mouse work in tty?
Sep 09 23:29:06 <remexre>	if I want to set up a gentoo device as a layer3-aware switch, is ebtables still a relevant tool?
Sep 09 23:29:21 <systo>	hmm, best way to update zfs on a livecd?
Sep 09 23:29:41 <iamben>	systo: use catalyst to build a new livecd
Sep 09 23:29:53 <mikejw>	iamben, how do I boot the new kenerl to tty?
Sep 09 23:30:02 <iamben>	mikejw: pass "nox" kernel param
Sep 09 23:30:34 <systo>	iamben anyway to do without a spare gentoo system?
Sep 09 23:30:49 <iamben>	systo: chroot on another linux
Sep 09 23:30:55 <systo>	kk
Sep 09 23:31:35 <mikejw>	iamben so the line that starts linux /vmlinuz-4.16.66-gentoo....  add 'nox' to the end?
Sep 09 23:31:47 <iamben>	mikejw: yep then press f10 to boot it
Sep 09 23:32:28 <mikejw>	iamben thanks... so that brings up login prompt and I can't type aything
Sep 09 23:32:54 <iamben>	mikejw: do you have another machine you can ssh in with?
Sep 09 23:32:57 <mikejw>	if only I had a ps2 keyboard :D
Sep 09 23:33:20 <mikejw>	good question
Sep 09 23:33:39 <iamben>	seems like you do have the PC, whether network+sshd is up is another question
Sep 09 23:36:28 <mikejw>	as a short-term solution, can I add the old kernel version back (so that it shows up in eselect)?
Sep 09 23:37:03 <iamben>	you need to build it again?
Sep 09 23:37:21 <iamben>	isn't it already built? why do you need to eselect it
Sep 09 23:37:30 <mikejw>	I guess I don't
Sep 09 23:41:25 <mikejw>	can't ssh for some reason (with new kernel)
Sep 09 23:41:35 <mikejw>	I guess the wifi hasn't come up
Sep 09 23:41:43 <iamben>	maybe for the same reason as your usb problem, none of your modules are loading
Sep 09 23:41:59 <mikejw>	yeah
Sep 09 23:42:47 <katana_web>	is /lib on its own partition, by chance?
Sep 09 23:44:19 <katana_web>	also is your WiFi on the USB bus...
Sep 09 23:44:30 <mikejw>	no
Sep 09 23:45:32 <mikejw>	dayme.. now X says no screens found (with old kernel)
Sep 09 23:46:19 <iamben>	maybe you should just work extra hard on getting the new kernel going
Sep 10 00:00:07 <mroh>	what is the fastest way to generate a bootable iso/usb image from the current running system?
Sep 10 00:07:27 <katana_web>	mroh wget iso && dd if=iso of=usb
Sep 10 00:10:36 <BtbN>	You should read the question again.
Sep 10 00:11:56 <katana_web>	converting a current system to a live image... maybe a little bit more involved...
Sep 10 00:12:50 <iamben>	im not aware of any tools to automate that
Sep 10 00:13:11 <BtbN>	It's also very much not straight forward
Sep 10 00:15:12 <iamben>	if you just pretend that your usb stick is a hard drive with (nearly) unlimited writes & speed, it's not so bad
Sep 10 00:17:10 <mroh>	Ah, catalyst w/ these spec files: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/releng.git/tree/releases/weekly/specs/amd64
Sep 10 00:17:26 <BtbN>	That creates a fresh one
Sep 10 00:28:59 <katana_web>	USB3 stick works pretty well as a rootfs
Sep 10 00:30:14 <BtbN>	Except it writes through fairly fast
Sep 10 00:30:27 <BtbN>	not even remotely close to the durability of an SSD
Sep 10 00:31:05 <earendil>	you can have an ssd on the end of that usb3...
Sep 10 00:31:37 <iamben>	but i think we're getting away from the actual question he asked
Sep 10 00:37:47 <mroh>	found some .deb based stuff, or something like this: https://github.com/Tomas-M/linux-live... but, no problem, if there is no such tool, lets write it ^^
Sep 10 01:00:16 <mikejw>	anyone any ideas how I can enable a PCI-e asus wifi adapter in the kernel
Sep 10 01:00:31 <mikejw>	I can't refer to the old kernel I was using because the Makefile has disappeared
Sep 10 01:00:59 <grknight>	mikejw: what's the pci id from 'lspci -nn'?
Sep 10 01:01:02 <iamben>	mikejw: you still have .config
Sep 10 01:01:13 <iamben>	didn't you copy that to your new kernel source dir before building?
Sep 10 01:02:00 <mikejw>	I used ./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh
Sep 10 01:02:09 <grknight>	why?
Sep 10 01:02:24 <mikejw>	perhaps it doesn't do what I thought
Sep 10 01:02:37 <iamben>	i just use cp
Sep 10 01:02:46 <mikejw>	ah cool.. I'll try that
Sep 10 01:02:49 <grknight>	you copy the old .config and then do either 'make oldconfig' or 'make olddefconfig'
Sep 10 01:03:19 <grknight>	(the former asks questions, the latter assumes kernel defaults on new options)
Sep 10 01:04:36 <mikejw>	ok giving that a whirl
Sep 10 02:31:26 <KuroLevin>	hi
Sep 10 02:31:39 <mroh>	hey
Sep 10 02:32:00 <KuroLevin>	I'm having some trouble with hw video decoding in the browser
Sep 10 02:32:48 <KuroLevin>	its webkit-gtk based so it uses gsttreamer i think
Sep 10 02:32:51 <Kangie>	Hi KuroLevin.
Sep 10 02:33:04 <Kangie>	So which browser, which codec?
Sep 10 02:33:53 <KuroLevin>	the thing is the video gliches out and i see in dmesg the kernel trying to load the nvidia firmware
Sep 10 02:34:17 <KuroLevin>	the intresting part is that i have -vdpau and vaapi
Sep 10 02:34:27 <KuroLevin>	(optimus laptop)
Sep 10 02:35:11 <KuroLevin>	browser is luakit and codec i think is all but i just tried x264
Sep 10 02:35:30 <KuroLevin>	all of them*
Sep 10 02:36:41 <KuroLevin>	suposedly it should be using the intel gpu to do the video decoding (vaapi)
Sep 10 02:37:42 <KuroLevin>	but for some reason it's trying to use the nvidia gpu (and fails as i dont have the firmware installed)
Sep 10 02:39:55 <Kangie>	Hm.
Sep 10 02:40:03 <Kangie>	I assume that you're choosing not to use the nvidia gpu for some reason?
Sep 10 02:40:16 <KuroLevin>	uses too much battery
Sep 10 02:40:46 <KuroLevin>	i only have the nouveau drivers installed so i can use the hdmi output
Sep 10 02:41:09 <Kangie>	Fair enough. Do you know if your laptop supports 'Hybrid Graphics'?
Sep 10 02:41:29 <Kangie>	It may be possible to configure it to use the intel GPU on battery and nvidia on AC
Sep 10 02:42:27 <Kangie>	though, if you needed noveau drivers to enable hdmi output that may not work.
Sep 10 02:42:37 <KuroLevin>	sometime ago it was working fine
Sep 10 02:42:54 <KuroLevin>	it supports hybrid graphics as far as i can tell
Sep 10 02:43:09 <Kangie>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hybrid_graphics might be worth looking into at some point.
Sep 10 02:43:23 <KuroLevin>	i can use DRI_PRIME variable to do offloading at least
Sep 10 02:45:17 <Kangie>	thanks for reminding me that I needed to sort out vaapi on this laptop.
Sep 10 02:45:23 <drbombay>	is it possible to run wayland witout xserver
Sep 10 02:45:57 <Kangie>	drbombay, do you mean without running the x11 apps in their own little desktop-y thing?
Sep 10 02:46:00 <KuroLevin>	i have already looked into that some time ago and left everything working fine
Sep 10 02:46:18 <Kangie>	or do you mean just start wayland directly?
Sep 10 02:46:21 <KuroLevin>	but something changed and i dont know what
Sep 10 02:47:34 <Kangie>	Hm.
Sep 10 02:47:37 <drbombay>	Kangie, yes
Sep 10 02:47:43 <Kangie>	... to which one?
Sep 10 02:48:21 <drbombay>	wayland only
Sep 10 02:48:21 <zxcat>	Gn! what choices as "wifi client manager" for shell mode we have?
Sep 10 02:48:41 <Kangie>	zxcat, network manager works from the shell, I believe.
Sep 10 02:48:50 <Kangie>	yeah, nmcli
Sep 10 02:49:20 <zxcat>	checking. ty
Sep 10 02:49:48 <grknight>	zxcat: nmtui for NM ncurses; there's also connman's interface if you don't like NM
Sep 10 02:50:19 <KuroLevin>	zxcat you can use wpa_cli directly but be warned as it is not user-frendly at all
Sep 10 02:50:22 <drbombay>	Kangie,  just start wayland directly
Sep 10 02:50:23 <grknight>	(the two are mutually exclusive so don't try both at the same time)
Sep 10 02:52:14 <zxcat>	no nmcli or nmtui packages... KuroLevin true.
Sep 10 02:54:00 <KuroLevin>	I think nmcli and nmtui are bundled with the networkmanager package but not sure
Sep 10 02:54:44 <Kangie>	zxcat, it's part of networkmanager
Sep 10 02:55:48 <zxcat>	ok
Sep 10 02:56:45 <Kangie>	drbombay, one minute.
Sep 10 02:57:46 <Kangie>	drbombay, check out Sakaki's guide. https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide/Setting_up_the_GNOME_3_Desktop
Sep 10 02:57:55 <Kangie>	There's also an openrc version.
Sep 10 02:58:20 <Kangie>	It's for gnome, but I'm sure you can adapt that. What you end up doing is calling wayland directly, and having wayland run an xserver for legacy apps.
Sep 10 02:58:38 <KuroLevin>	So Kangie, any idea why gtreamer is trying to use nvidia hw decoding when it should not even be capable of it (-vdpau USE flag)
Sep 10 02:59:24 <doc235>	ok
Sep 10 03:00:10 <Kangie>	KuroLevin, not really. gstreamer doesn't seem to have any vdpau/vaapi flags.
Sep 10 03:00:15 <doc235>	sorry wrong channel
Sep 10 03:00:39 <Kangie>	but possibly some plugins. hm.
Sep 10 03:01:42 <zxcat>	does dbus USE flag for wpa_supplicant is needed?
Sep 10 03:02:43 <Kangie>	zxcat, there isn't a dbus use flag for that package.
Sep 10 03:03:02 <grknight>	Kangie: yes there is
Sep 10 03:03:05 <zxcat>	what do you mean ?
Sep 10 03:03:08 <zxcat>	ah
Sep 10 03:04:18 <Kangie>	I stand corrected.
Sep 10 03:04:25 <Kangie>	Should have looked at the ebuild.
Sep 10 03:04:32 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 10 03:05:33 <wraeth>	Kangie: `equery uses <package>` (provided by gentoolkit) is also handy.
Sep 10 03:05:54 <Kangie>	You can try emerging it without dbus. If you plan to use NetworkManager it might cause issues down the line.
Sep 10 03:07:28 <KuroLevin>	ty, im gonna dig a little deeper
Sep 10 03:07:30 <Kangie>	KuroLevin, I have no idea. Sorry mate.
Sep 10 03:12:15 <zxcat>	guess it is
Sep 10 03:16:21 <zxcat>	Kangie: what is the difference between connecting with wpa_cli and wpa_supplicant?
Sep 10 03:18:36 <grknight>	zxcat: wpa_cli is a cli interface to the wpa_supplicant daemon
Sep 10 03:22:58 <zxcat>	I remember to use wpa_supplicant years ago, with conf files not the wpa_cli. it have a way to "view" networks in the area ?
Sep 10 03:24:06 <grknight>	scanning is usually done with a low level tool like net-wireless/iw
Sep 10 03:24:37 <wraeth>	I don't use wpa_cli but the 'scan' argument may be relevant as well. See 'wpa_cli --help'.
Sep 10 03:25:14 *	grknight guesses the wpa manuals are as outdated as some of its protocols
Sep 10 03:26:10 <KuroLevin>	wpa_cli is an interface to wpa_supplicant
Sep 10 03:27:36 <grknight>	zxcat: looks like you need: wpa_cli scan ; sleep 5 ; wpa_cli scan_results
Sep 10 03:28:23 <grknight>	or just install iw and do: iw dev wlan0 scan   (where wlan0 is the real device name)
Sep 10 03:33:10 <zxcat>	the iw was already instaled with wpa, but the result is "unreadeble" for iw... too many lines..  \\ the wpa_cli give me an error ( Failed to connect to non-global ctrl-ifname (nil)  error: no such file or dir
Sep 10 03:35:11 <zxcat>	just using networkmanager.. it have a nice ncurses interface
Sep 10 03:35:26 <zxcat>	ty
Sep 10 03:42:36 <tdr>	zxcat, nmtui?
Sep 10 03:43:00 <zxcat>	yes
Sep 10 03:43:42 <tdr>	zxcat, i use it too.  wpa can scan, and wpa_gui  is even nicer.  nmtui is universal tho because it works on terminal PLUS its easy
Sep 10 03:47:06 <zxcat>	is an "old" laptop but I'm "starting" to "love" tmux+vim+elinks+ranger for almost everything. Is an Awesome opportunity to a "noob" job, tools like nmtui.
Sep 10 03:47:51 <tdr>	zxcat, links -g  :)
Sep 10 03:48:17 <zxcat>	tdr that's for X
Sep 10 03:48:25 <tdr>	nope
Sep 10 03:48:32 <tdr>	works on console as well
Sep 10 03:48:47 <zxcat>	as images as presented as ASCII ?
Sep 10 03:48:57 <tdr>	fbcon flag ...
Sep 10 03:49:09 <zxcat>	hm
Sep 10 03:49:13 <tdr>	look at the USE flags for it, and it also supports console mouse (gpm)
Sep 10 03:49:56 <zxcat>	let me check.. links work well with ssl right? no sure which shell browser was unable to use it
Sep 10 03:49:57 <tdr>	the handbook used to mention links -g for reading during installs and even covered gpm
Sep 10 03:50:19 <tdr>	yes it supports both openssl and libressl (if you enable the libressl flag)
Sep 10 03:57:48 <zxcat>	very interesting.. looks better and gives more "control" Nice!
Sep 10 04:01:21 <zxcat>	what is "opening link in new window" ? elinks accept tabs
Sep 10 04:01:31 <kurly>	"try it and see" ;)
Sep 10 04:05:12 <zxcat>	kurly: nothing happen :) ... still not working with as "links -g" because I don't use mouse :D
Sep 10 04:12:34 <zxcat>	Suggestion: change links for elinks. Then the user can read other links related to some first link more easly. tabs are an awesome solution for shell mode. is like having tmux <3
Sep 10 04:13:04 <wokko>	zxcat: start 'gpm' service and mouse will work in 'links-g'
Sep 10 04:14:20 <zxcat>	wokko: not active from bios. but even if I use a USB mouse, something about the VT isn't working. I already touch inittab file, so.. maybe is the reason for.
Sep 10 04:18:57 <wokko>	zxcat: Ha, that's no good, links is pretty good without a X running, I use it in my spare room (gym) on a laptop to connect to plex so that I can have some tunes going in the background :)
Sep 10 04:21:54 <zxcat>	I check the suggestion of links.. still loving (next-tab(>)) (previous-tab(<)) shortcuts. the "other window" isn't anywhere, elinks wins :P
Sep 10 06:27:00 <DLPeterson>	Some time ago, I updated my system Lenovo T480s and after this point I was no longer able to connect to wifi networks, despite being able to see them and attempt to connect to them. I'm not sure if it is a Kernel configuration thing but that is my best guess. I've cleared out my NetworkManager logs, shut it down, enabled log level TRACE on all
Sep 10 06:27:01 <DLPeterson>	domains of NM, and restarted NetworkManager and attempted to connect. Here is the output: https://pastebin.com/7MaU8XFU
Sep 10 06:29:46 <DLPeterson>	The only thing that stands out to me in the log is `Activation: (wifi) association took too long, failing activation` -- anybody know if this is a matter of a simple timeout increase, or indicative of some larger problem?
Sep 10 06:32:12 <DLPeterson>	I have IPv6 disabled in my router, perhaps I need to disable this in my kernel as well? Anecdotal evidence online that perhaps this is the culprit...
Sep 10 06:32:41 <kurly>	it seems unlikely to me that IPv6 is the problem
Sep 10 06:32:48 <wraeth>	You could probably just disable IPv6 for the connection.
Sep 10 06:36:35 <DLPeterson>	kurly, wraeth, is there anything else in the log that stands out to you? I agree that IPv6 might be a red herring.
Sep 10 06:47:37 <wraeth>	DLPeterson: Not for me, but I'm not in a position to look at it properly. I was just suggesting an easier way to test your IPv6 hypothesis.
Sep 10 07:37:09 <_Cute_Kitty_>	hi i installed owncloud with this guide, used my pc ip instead of myDomain.com, and ran all the commands in this article, i'm using apache
Sep 10 07:37:10 <_Cute_Kitty_>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Owncloud
Sep 10 07:37:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	however, when i type, mypcIP/owncloud server refused to connect error
Sep 10 07:37:26 <_Cute_Kitty_>	what did I do wrong
Sep 10 07:39:15 <earendil>	can you verify its listening on the proper port?
Sep 10 07:42:56 <_Cute_Kitty_>	nvm got it thanks guys
Sep 10 07:45:09 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok i got it to work, but now it says "forbidden" you are not permitted to access this resource in the page that pops up when i type myip/owncloud
Sep 10 07:45:17 <_Cute_Kitty_>	apache port 443
Sep 10 07:45:48 <Kangie>	forbidden is a http error code.
Sep 10 07:46:17 <Kangie>	So check your owncloud permissions.
Sep 10 07:46:41 <Kangie>	and your apache config.
Sep 10 07:47:10 <_Cute_Kitty_>	how do i check owncloud permissions
Sep 10 07:48:16 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, did you follow the Owncloud guide on the gentoo wiki?
Sep 10 07:48:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes lol
Sep 10 07:48:34 <Kangie>	Cool, just trying to work out where you started from. :)
Sep 10 07:48:45 <_Cute_Kitty_>	np
Sep 10 07:48:56 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yeah i originally put myDomain.com in just like the guide did
Sep 10 07:49:12 <Kangie>	So you're at the point where the server is installed and running on your gentoo box, but the client fails with 403 when you try and connect from the owncloud client now?
Sep 10 07:49:12 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but then i  reran that command with my ip address instead
Sep 10 07:49:20 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes.
Sep 10 07:49:31 <_Cute_Kitty_>	server is installed, apache is running, but client fails 403
Sep 10 07:50:00 <Kangie>	OK, so a HTTP 403 means that the client doesn't have permission to access whatever resource it's attempting to.
Sep 10 07:50:26 <Kangie>	are there any apache error logs?
Sep 10 07:50:33 <_Cute_Kitty_>	no
Sep 10 07:50:50 <_Cute_Kitty_>	it just says apache reported error :forbidden
Sep 10 07:51:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	https://imgur.com/a/amrIk0H
Sep 10 07:51:40 <Kangie>	If you try and connect to your owncloud from a web browser (http://<ip>/owncloud) does it give a 403?
Sep 10 07:51:52 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes same exact error as pictured above
Sep 10 07:52:19 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but that time it says port 80
Sep 10 07:52:58 <Kangie>	OK. I'm going to take a look at the ebuild and see what it does.
Sep 10 07:54:03 <_Cute_Kitty_>	thanks
Sep 10 07:56:08 <_Cute_Kitty_>	Kangie: is it because the default directories that owncloud is setting up are in my root dirctory
Sep 10 07:56:13 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so it might be a permissions issue
Sep 10 07:56:17 <Kangie>	quite possibly
Sep 10 07:56:23 <Kangie>	Owncloud should be under your wwwroot
Sep 10 07:56:27 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes
Sep 10 07:56:36 <_Cute_Kitty_>	well, var/www/
Sep 10 07:56:39 <Kangie>	so usually /ar/www
Sep 10 07:56:43 <Kangie>	var/www
Sep 10 07:56:45 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yeah
Sep 10 07:56:46 <_Cute_Kitty_>	that
Sep 10 07:56:51 <_Cute_Kitty_>	that's where it all is*
Sep 10 07:57:04 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so idk what that means in terms of other ip addresses accesssing it
Sep 10 07:57:25 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, your webserver (apache2) only serves things below the webroot
Sep 10 07:57:36 <Kangie>	so on your computer you have /var/www/owncloud/folder/file
Sep 10 07:57:49 <Kangie>	but as far as someone connecting to apache, they'll only see /owncloud/folder/file
Sep 10 07:58:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	 var/www/172.31.78.39/htdocs/cloud/
Sep 10 07:58:12 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, who owns /var/www/owncloud ?
Sep 10 07:58:21 <_Cute_Kitty_>	those are the directories i have
Sep 10 07:59:24 <Kangie>	OK... You should have a folder /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
Sep 10 07:59:31 <Kangie>	.. though I am looking at debian. Don't mind me.
Sep 10 08:01:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	no
Sep 10 08:01:30 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, I've been looking at debian apache all morning, It's configured differently on that distro. :)
Sep 10 08:02:02 <_Cute_Kitty_>	modules.d vhosts.d httpd.conf and magic
Sep 10 08:02:08 <_Cute_Kitty_>	are the two folders and two files
Sep 10 08:02:10 <Kangie>	Yeah, I was wrong. Sorry!
Sep 10 08:02:40 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, what happens if you go to http://<ip>/172.31.78.39/htdocs/cloud/
Sep 10 08:02:40 <Kangie>	?
Sep 10 08:03:02 <_Cute_Kitty_>	same error
Sep 10 08:03:07 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i already tried that haha
Sep 10 08:03:59 <Kangie>	Yeah, I don't know much about apache on gentoo, unfortunately. Nor the owncloud installation.
Sep 10 08:04:23 <Kangie>	I'd install it to troubleshoot for you, but I've had a compile at 100% on all cores for the last few hours.
Sep 10 08:05:47 <Kangie>	_Cute_Kitty_, in your httpd.conf, is there a vhost with ServerName 172.31.78.39?
Sep 10 08:06:02 <Kangie>	Probably towards the end of the conf file.
Sep 10 08:06:35 <Kangie>	afk for 5.
Sep 10 08:10:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	Kangie : I have to go to bed, I'll be back tomorrow if i still haven't ifgured it out. than you
Sep 10 09:06:09 <genewitch>	what's the best hypervisor software i can run under gentoo?
Sep 10 09:06:24 <genewitch>	gentoo on the metal, and please, a decent VM interface
Sep 10 09:06:30 <genewitch>	virtualbox is fine
Sep 10 09:06:47 <Kangie>	What do you want to get out of it?
Sep 10 09:06:57 <Kangie>	what guest OSes do you want to run?
Sep 10 09:07:37 <ratrace>	it's not like you have a palette of options. virtualbox or qemu-kvm, virtmanager interface if you need GUI. I recommend qemu-kvm
Sep 10 09:08:01 <Kangie>	I was going to go with qemu-kvm. It works pretty well.
Sep 10 09:08:13 <genewitch>	ratrace: does virtmanager allow me to connect to the GUI from another machine
Sep 10 09:08:22 <genewitch>	say, on the same physical network
Sep 10 09:08:29 <ratrace>	I don't know, I don't use it, I prefer cli qemu-system-x86_64
Sep 10 09:08:29 <grawity>	it does have SPICE for that, yes
Sep 10 09:08:44 <grawity>	or, do you mean the _manager_ GUI? yes, it has that too
Sep 10 09:08:46 <genewitch>	right now we're using proxmox, wok, and some other thing, and virtualbox
Sep 10 09:09:00 <grawity>	(I think virt-manager can use both qemu-kvm and virtualbox as "backends"?)
Sep 10 09:09:55 <genewitch>	Yes i have hardware i want to test with different on the metal OS, ubuntu is ok like i haven't had any major issues with core functionality. Windows is, you know, windows, but the GUI is familiar for hyper-V and virtualbox is an old friend.
Sep 10 09:10:12 <genewitch>	wok is the worst of all worlds
Sep 10 09:10:37 <genewitch>	wok/kimchi et al. the only part that works is qemu
Sep 10 09:11:27 <genewitch>	i'm on a qemu VM using irssi in a gentoo VM right now
Sep 10 09:11:51 <genewitch>	have been for, i dunno, a year at least
Sep 10 09:12:45 <genewitch>	Gentoo saves me so much time, because if i can't download something and run it on my gentoo machines... it's going to be a PITA on any other OS, too. at least gentoo tells me within the first 60000ms
Sep 10 09:14:14 <genewitch>	Anyhow i will look at virtmanager, only used it to fix broken VMs on CLI. never knew there was an option for GUI
Sep 10 09:14:46 <genewitch>	Do you guys trust gentoo as a hypervisor?
Sep 10 09:14:55 <ratrace>	"trust"?
Sep 10 09:14:58 <genewitch>	"guys"
Sep 10 09:15:06 <grawity>	"gentoo"?
Sep 10 09:15:18 <ratrace>	"?"
Sep 10 09:15:26 <genewitch>	the penguin or the OS. yes do we trust gentoo as a hypervisor
Sep 10 09:16:00 <genewitch>	I vote yes.
Sep 10 09:16:01 <ratrace>	you'll have to define "trust".
Sep 10 09:16:05 <Kangie>	You have to trust something somewhere. I made the decision to trust in the ability of my intel processor to generate random numbers to speed up my init.
Sep 10 09:16:08 <ratrace>	trust gentoo to do/not-do what?
Sep 10 09:16:21 <Kangie>	But there's also an Intel ME somewhere in there, and I don't trust that processor. I don't know what code it's running at any given time.
Sep 10 09:16:26 <genewitch>	ratrace: make menuconfig and going through every screen once or twice a year
Sep 10 09:16:38 <genewitch>	running that kernel long term
Sep 10 09:16:49 <genewitch>	i.e. no reboots
Sep 10 09:16:52 <ratrace>	genewitch: sorry you're not making much sense. where does "trust" come in that sentence?
Sep 10 09:17:28 <genewitch>	well you gotta build the kernel
Sep 10 09:18:02 <Kangie>	https://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf
Sep 10 09:18:05 <Kangie>	genewitch, ^
Sep 10 09:18:30 <genewitch>	yes that title
Sep 10 09:18:33 <ratrace>	this convo is disjointed in so many ways, it hurts to be here... off to have a breakfast, toodle-doo!
Sep 10 09:18:59 <Kangie>	So genewitch. For your example of the gentoo-sources version of the linux kernel.
Sep 10 09:19:07 <Kangie>	Do you trust the Linux Kernel maintainers?
Sep 10 09:19:17 <genewitch>	yes
Sep 10 09:19:21 <Kangie>	Do you trust Gentoo's developers to make their changes without compromising you?
Sep 10 09:19:34 <genewitch>	i think so
Sep 10 09:19:41 <genewitch>	it depends on what you mean
Sep 10 09:19:43 <Kangie>	Do you trust that the binaries that shipped with your stage3 that you're using to build the kernel haven't been compromised
Sep 10 09:19:45 <xcm>	hey all. i have this lenovo x240 and a docking station for it. xrandr shows a bunch of ports, but doesn't detect the hdmi screen connected to the dock. what could i be missing here?
Sep 10 09:20:15 <genewitch>	Kangie: it is possible to rebuild the entire system with source code, iirc. i haven't done that in a long time but there's an emerge option
Sep 10 09:20:24 <Kangie>	genewitch, read the paper I linked you.
Sep 10 09:20:39 <genewitch>	i'm trying but i'm also reading here so i will make this an audio file
Sep 10 09:20:42 <Kangie>	it's about a theoretical attack where a compromised compiler knows that it's compiling a new version of itself, and so inserts a copy of the backdoor into the compiled code.
Sep 10 09:21:30 <Kangie>	and again, what is "trust" in this context? Do you "trust" the hardware that you're running on? What about the firmware binaries that you can't get the source for, and have to accept to make things like networking or video work properly.
Sep 10 09:24:16 <genewitch>	Kangie: yes i know about the theoretical backdoors. and i can't do anything about the hardware. Hypervisors gotta run somewhere. Guess i'll give it a shot.
Sep 10 09:24:40 <Kangie>	There you go, You can trust the gentoo kernel. :)
Sep 10 09:24:56 <genewitch>	yeah, i figured.
Sep 10 09:25:21 <genewitch>	screenreader is still reading
Sep 10 09:35:52 <DrEeevil>	Kangie: do you trust the hardware you have? :)
Sep 10 09:51:23 <Kangie>	DrEeevil, Man, it's a laptop. I have to load binary firmware to get my wifi adapater working.
Sep 10 09:51:27 <Kangie>	Also it has an IME.
Sep 10 09:51:29 <DrEeevil>	right
Sep 10 09:51:46 <Kangie>	But at the same time, I use my phone for more sensitive stuff, and it's even worse.
Sep 10 09:52:18 <Kangie>	Baseband processor, firmware bins..
Sep 10 09:52:39 <Kangie>	So, I trust my laptop *enough*.
Sep 10 09:57:01 <Paradox55>	How do I ignore a package? It's getting stuck on xf86-input-synaptics and if I add it to package.mask it complains that its missing
Sep 10 09:57:54 <fling>	Paradox55: add it to package.provided
Sep 10 09:58:20 <fling>	Paradox55: or just use --skipfirst if you just want to skip it for now
Sep 10 09:58:38 <fling>	Paradox55: Or edit INPUT_DEVICES in make.conf
Sep 10 09:58:57 <fling>	Paradox55: just having INPUT_DEVICES="libinput" there might work fine for you
Sep 10 09:59:02 <fling>	and no need for xf86-input-synaptics
Sep 10 09:59:59 <Paradox55>	im more interested on why it wont build
Sep 10 10:00:09 <Paradox55>	I left the pc running for hours and it was still stuck on the precheck
Sep 10 10:00:13 <fling>	what is your INPUT_DEVICES?
Sep 10 10:00:24 <fling>	oh ok
Sep 10 10:00:31 <fling>	try `emerge --skipfirst`
Sep 10 10:00:51 <fling>	leave figuring out for later and build everything else first
Sep 10 10:01:00 <fling>	there is a possibility it will resolve on it's own

Sep 10 23:14:59 <iamben>	5.2.14-gentoo with genkernel boots? but then you say "5.2.14 is just broken"
Sep 10 23:15:28 <q3cpma>	Hello, does anyone lack /usr/bin symlinks with the new clang-8?
Sep 10 23:21:18 <fling>	username234: is it something wrong in my .config?
Sep 10 23:21:57 <javashin>	the changelog of 5.2.14 shows a lot of changes from emails @intel.com something must be broken for me
Sep 10 23:22:16 <javashin>	iamben, "5.2.14" in general is broken for me
Sep 10 23:22:22 <javashin>	<iamben> 5.2.14-gentoo with genkernel boots? but then you say "5.2.14 is just broken" no
Sep 10 23:22:37 <username234>	fling: I haven't built that version of the kernel yet, so I'm not 100% sure.  Are these the standard gentoo-sources-5.2.14, or have they been additionally patched in some way?
Sep 10 23:22:49 <javashin>	"5.2.14" dont boot from any kind of sources "-***"
Sep 10 23:24:20 <javashin>	is not the video
Sep 10 23:24:30 <javashin>	no drm/intel changes
Sep 10 23:25:17 <javashin>	lets GOOO
Sep 10 23:25:24 *	javashin  time make -j3 oldconfig prepare bzImage modules install modules_install headers_install ; emerge -v1 virtualbox-modules acpi_call ; genkernel ramdisk --zfs 
Sep 10 23:25:33 <javashin>	on 5.2.13
Sep 10 23:25:43 <javashin>	bla
Sep 10 23:25:53 <javashin>	i just need a booteable kernel
Sep 10 23:25:53 <mroh>	spam
Sep 10 23:26:08 <username234>	javashin: why are you invoking all of those targets?
Sep 10 23:27:07 <javashin>	thinks goes smoothly all the time i emerge a new kernel , that i remove the old one just when i finish the new build
Sep 10 23:27:22 <javashin>	thinks/things*
Sep 10 23:27:37 <javashin>	today is the day
Sep 10 23:27:39 <javashin>	ahhaha
Sep 10 23:30:53 <fling>	username234: this is linux-5.1.21-gentoo with shiftfs and crypto gpl revert patches
Sep 10 23:30:55 <iamben>	your kernel build procedure is a bit nonsensical, probably shoudl move to full "genkernel all" in the future.  but let's see if you can get 5.2.13 working again.
Sep 10 23:30:59 <iamben>	javashin: ^
Sep 10 23:31:05 <fling>	username234: it builds on other hosts with different configs :P
Sep 10 23:31:42 <iamben>	i think in the first sentence here, you forgot the word "don't"  16:14 < javashin> 5.2.14-gentoo with genkernel or genkernel-next boot  16:22 < javashin> iamben, "5.2.14" in general is broken for me
Sep 10 23:31:55 <iamben>	which made the whole thing very confusing
Sep 10 23:32:25 <username234>	fling: did you hand edit .config or did you always use make menuconfig or make nconfig?
Sep 10 23:32:41 <username234>	or make oldconfig
Sep 10 23:34:43 <fling>	username234: used menuconfig with /proc/config.gz from running 4.20
Sep 10 23:35:04 <javashin>	yes
Sep 10 23:35:07 <javashin>	 my bad
Sep 10 23:35:34 <fling>	username234: yes, also used oldconfig first actually
Sep 10 23:35:41 <javashin>	ok emerge real    16m17.785s
Sep 10 23:35:45 <javashin>	time
Sep 10 23:36:00 <javashin>	lol
Sep 10 23:36:02 <javashin>	fling,
Sep 10 23:36:16 <javashin>	there are a lot of changes from 4.20 to 5.1
Sep 10 23:36:59 <username234>	fling: do you see the error with all the configs or just 1 / some ?
Sep 10 23:37:25 <fling>	javashin: I usually just hold ender in oldconfig when it starts asking about devices, because I don't care about all these things I don't have
Sep 10 23:37:44 <fling>	username234: probably only this one
Sep 10 23:37:52 <fling>	username234: I will try building with another one
Sep 10 23:39:03 <username234>	fling: you might try using 'oldefconfig' instead then (I think that's the correct target)
Sep 10 23:39:25 <fling>	username234: I used it prior menuconfig
Sep 10 23:39:37 <fling>	Just having hard time recalling what I did
Sep 10 23:39:54 <fling>	But I performed it twice just to be sure
Sep 10 23:39:57 <username234>	fling: no I mean, olddefconfig instead of oldconfig.  You wouldn't have to hold down enter then.
Sep 10 23:40:11 <fling>	like removed the sources and started from scratch using this config
Sep 10 23:40:24 <fling>	got the same results with LD looping there
Sep 10 23:41:01 <fling>	username234: but I only hold ender about devices and I'm choosing other things before the devices
Sep 10 23:41:02 <username234>	fling: what if you try by applying 1 patch at a time?
Sep 10 23:41:13 <fling>	nah, patches are good.
Sep 10 23:41:36 <fling>	I believe I have this issue even without any patches
Sep 10 23:41:37 <username234>	fling: so it does this with the stock gentoo-sources?
Sep 10 23:41:58 <fling>	Yes, I remember seeing it a long time ago with this config
Sep 10 23:42:08 <fling>	before I added the patches for sure
Sep 10 23:42:20 <username234>	fling: have you tried running fsck?
Sep 10 23:42:33 <fling>	there is no such thing for zfs
Sep 10 23:42:58 <username234>	fling: does ls <filename> find the file?
Sep 10 23:43:14 <fling>	header files? I should check
Sep 10 23:45:01 <fling>	username234: no, they are missing
Sep 10 23:45:43 <username234>	fling: could you try again using a clean version of gentoo-sources without the patches?
Sep 10 23:45:56 <username234>	fling: make should build everything the kernel depends on
Sep 11 00:17:18 <scrote>	hello.
Sep 11 00:17:58 <scrote>	If my nvidia card is pci express, is it safe to disable /dev/agpgart in the kernel?
Sep 11 00:18:30 <tdr>	no
Sep 11 00:18:45 <tdr>	agpgart is used for video memory, dont confuse it with "agp port"
Sep 11 00:19:32 <scrote>	oh ok, thanks
Sep 11 00:20:20 <tdr>	for the options under it, pick intel if your board is intel based, amd if it amd based etc .. (mb, not video card)
Sep 11 00:20:31 <tdr>	it defaults to via or something dumb
Sep 11 00:20:59 <scrote>	should I turn on nVidia Frame Buffer support?
Sep 11 00:21:03 <tdr>	NO
Sep 11 00:21:10 <scrote>	ok
Sep 11 00:21:12 <tdr>	are you efi booting?
Sep 11 00:21:17 <scrote>	yes
Sep 11 00:21:23 <tdr>	the only thing you need from the fb screen is efifb
Sep 11 00:22:01 <tdr>	those other framebuffers were for non-efi framebuffers (bios booting) for old video cards
Sep 11 00:22:03 <scrote>	<*>   AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support   // This ?
Sep 11 00:22:07 <scrote>	beign under agpgart
Sep 11 00:22:33 <tdr>	is your motherboard chipset amd?
Sep 11 00:22:39 <scrote>	I'm running a ryzen, yes
Sep 11 00:22:44 <tdr>	yeah that one then
Sep 11 00:22:58 <tdr>	you can use the in-kernel DRM too
Sep 11 00:23:29 <tdr>	with    [*]   Enable legacy fbdev support for your modesetting driver  as a suboption
Sep 11 00:26:53 <scrote>	What's the path to that?
Sep 11 00:27:23 <iamben>	that won't help you unless you use nouveau
Sep 11 00:27:31 <iamben>	you're going to use nvidia-drivers, right?
Sep 11 00:27:53 <scrote>	yes.
Sep 11 00:28:02 <scrote>	nouveau is off
Sep 11 00:28:22 <tdr>	it wont hurt tho either.
Sep 11 00:33:44 <tlhonmey>	So I just had emerge bomb out during a glibc upgrade and all I've got is non-root busybox...  Any other commands I try to run it complains about "Accessing a corrupted shared library."
Sep 11 00:34:20 <tlhonmey>	It doesn't seem to be respecting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Does that not work if glibc is hosed?
Sep 11 00:34:49 <CompanionCube>	considering that glibc implements the dynamic linker...
Sep 11 00:34:58 <tlhonmey>	Yeah, I was kind of afraid of that.
Sep 11 00:35:16 <tlhonmey>	Didn't know if anybody knew some secret place to poke it to get it to load glibc from a different location.
Sep 11 00:35:25 <CompanionCube>	you can escalate to root via reboot and init= maybe
Sep 11 00:35:36 <CompanionCube>	of course then you have no network and probably no way to setup one
Sep 11 00:35:51 <tlhonmey>	Yeah, I know, but I really don't want to have to drive all the way out there...
Sep 11 00:36:35 <CompanionCube>	well, you could see if you can a non-b0rked glibc from somewhere
Sep 11 00:36:54 <tdr>	tlhonmey, did it "bomb out" during the actual emerge from the sandbox to the real fs?
Sep 11 00:36:56 <tlhonmey>	That's easy.  Can't copy it into /lib64 without root though.
Sep 11 00:37:10 <tlhonmey>	tdr: I think so, yes.  Everything that uses glibc is dead.
Sep 11 00:37:22 <tdr>	so basiclaly everything
Sep 11 00:37:24 <iamben>	so you've been relying on sudo to get root, and that's broken?
Sep 11 00:37:31 <tlhonmey>	Yep.
Sep 11 00:37:42 <CompanionCube>	and see if you can manually invoke your non-borked glibc's dynamic linker to do things
Sep 11 00:37:45 <tdr>	tlhonmey, boot livemedia and say which version of glibc you had
Sep 11 00:38:15 <tlhonmey>	tdr: remote access.  If I could boot livemedia I wouldn't need help fixing it.  I've fixed worse locally before.
Sep 11 00:38:20 <iamben>	im not sure this is recoverable remotely
Sep 11 00:38:33 <tdr>	tlhonmey, do you have remote console during boot?
Sep 11 00:38:48 <iamben>	you either need a new static+suid sudo binary, or you'd have to modify the library path for sudo which im pretty sure is not "legal"
Sep 11 00:38:50 <tdr>	tlhonmey, i mean, can you see your bootloader etc?
Sep 11 00:39:12 <iamben>	you can't just allow unpriveleged users to link in random libc when he calls sudo
Sep 11 00:39:14 <tdr>	tlhonmey, rescue shell from initramfs could possibly help you if you can see the boot process
Sep 11 00:39:27 <tlhonmey>	tdr: I might be able to get someone to point a webcam at the screen and tell them what to type over the phone.
Sep 11 00:39:28 <Xelnor>	tlhonmey: you still have a running root shell?
Sep 11 00:39:39 <tlhonmey>	Xelnor: If I did, I'd have fixed this already.
Sep 11 00:39:46 <CompanionCube>	hm, is it perhaps possible to LD_PRELOAD glibc?
Sep 11 00:39:53 <tlhonmey>	Doesn't seem to be.
Sep 11 00:40:02 <iamben>	im pretty sure you cannot LD_PRELOAD libs for your sudo call
Sep 11 00:40:06 <tlhonmey>	I think it's glibc that listens to LD_PRELOAD
Sep 11 00:40:13 <Xelnor>	tlhonmey: you could have a shell as root but no binary working
Sep 11 00:40:19 <tdr>	tlhonmey, if you're going to remove puppet-master, make them boot livemedia
Sep 11 00:40:35 <tdr>	tlhonmey, better chance of success than via a tiny shell
Sep 11 00:40:42 <tdr>	s/remove/remote
Sep 11 00:40:50 <Xelnor>	tlhonmey: if you have a root shell, busybox could help you
Sep 11 00:40:54 <tlhonmey>	tdr: I could also just drive over there and fix it.  I was just hoping somebody knew something I didn't.
Sep 11 00:40:57 <iamben>	i think you are locked out by design
Sep 11 00:40:59 <Xelnor>	even if every other command fails
Sep 11 00:41:10 <iamben>	you cannot LD_PRELOAD stuff into a suid binary like sudo
Sep 11 00:41:17 <iamben>	this would be a big security problem.
Sep 11 00:41:32 <tlhonmey>	iamben: yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking.  From now on I make sure to set busybox setuid before touching glibc...
Sep 11 00:41:56 <tdr>	tlhonmey, for many things yes you could.  if it's pain to handle stuff with, consider putitng a "safe" boot option in your grub, a known-good bootable iso or small little partition with basic os, enough to get you booted so you can fix your other one
Sep 11 00:41:57 <iamben>	or keep a copy of the root password
Sep 11 00:42:09 <tlhonmey>	su is dynamic
Sep 11 00:42:24 <tlhonmey>	Busybox su requires busybox to be setuid, or so it says.
Sep 11 00:42:34 <tlhonmey>	I have the root password, just probably no way to do anything with it...
Sep 11 00:42:51 <tlhonmey>	maybe I can hack something via ssh...  Let's see...
Sep 11 00:42:53 <Xelnor>	maybe ssh as root?
Sep 11 00:43:01 <CompanionCube>	probably won't work
Sep 11 00:43:04 <Xelnor>	ssh root@localhost /bin/busybox
Sep 11 00:43:12 <CompanionCube>	that might
Sep 11 00:43:13 <iamben>	i assume sshd will also bomb out
Sep 11 00:43:14 <Xelnor>	if sshd is already loaded, it could work
Sep 11 00:43:25 <Xelnor>	worth a try at least :)
Sep 11 00:43:35 <tlhonmey>	I think sshd is bombing when it tries to check the password.
Sep 11 00:43:35 <tdr>	CompanionCube, likely you're going to end up needing a system tool that busybox doesn't provide tho, and it too will be broken
Sep 11 00:43:56 <tdr>	tlhonmey, i guess ^^ was for you ...
Sep 11 00:44:35 <tlhonmey>	tdr: all I need is enough root to copy a few library files.  Busybox would be enough.
Sep 11 00:44:35 <Xelnor>	tdr: if busybox is alive, and network open, you can use `busybox netcat` to fetch binaries :)
Sep 11 00:45:06 <tlhonmey>	Yeah, I've done that.  I just can't get enough privileges to do anything with them...
Sep 11 00:45:18 <tlhonmey>	Maybe I can convince it to mount something with a setuid version of busybox...
Sep 11 00:46:04 <tdr>	Xelnor, understood.  but it only takes one command that busybox does have and *bam* you could in worse shape
Sep 11 01:03:57 <scrote>	 [*] Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk') // If this is not a laptop, is this ok to turn off ?
Sep 11 01:04:49 <tlhonmey>	do you want to be able to hibernate it?
Sep 11 01:05:06 <tlhonmey>	I hibernate my desktop occasionally when they want me to move my desk and I don't want to lose my state...
Sep 11 01:06:06 <tdr>	scrote, if you wont use it, its fair game to be disabled
Sep 11 01:19:53 <lupus>	It seems that no matter which plymouth theme i choose, the background will just be grey and the luks password prompt is white. Is it because the theme is in /usr/share/plymouth/themes on the encrypted volume ?
Sep 11 01:22:33 <tlhonmey>	Might be.
Sep 11 01:23:02 <tlhonmey>	The grey and white theme is also its textmode fallback that it uses if anything goes wrong.
Sep 11 01:23:26 <tlhonmey>	What are you using for an initramfs generator?
Sep 11 01:24:03 <lupus>	tlhomey: dracut. i have verified that when i run dracut --kver 5.2.13-gentoo that plymouth is enabled.
Sep 11 01:24:19 <lupus>	tlhonmey*
Sep 11 01:24:55 <tlhonmey>	Well, if it has any problem at all it'll use that text-mode theme.  Have you tried invoking it while the system is up and running?
Sep 11 01:25:10 <tlhonmey>	You'll want to use ssh or something since it covers the screen and keyboard when it comes up.
Sep 11 01:25:19 <tlhonmey>	Otherwise you'll have a hard time turning it off.
Sep 11 01:25:42 <tlhonmey>	Note also that if you want to debug it you have to both build it with the debug USE flag *and* invoke it with --debug.
Sep 11 01:26:46 <tlhonmey>	Unfortunately I have to get going.  If you're still having the problem tomorrow I can probably help sort it out.  I had to rip the whole thing apart a few months back to make it work with genkernel.
Sep 11 01:27:26 <lupus>	tlhonmey: thanks for that. i might hit you up :)
Sep 11 01:27:48 <tlhonmey>	If you get it into debug mode it'll usually tell you why it's not happy.
Sep 11 01:31:41 <joseph2>	does /usr need to be present at boot time when using systemd?
Sep 11 01:32:31 <tdr>	josam, afaik it it does for systemd or openrc either one nowdays
Sep 11 01:32:49 <tdr>	joseph2  afaik it it does for systemd or openrc either one nowdays
Sep 11 01:33:00 <joseph2>	thanks!
Sep 11 01:33:33 <wraeth>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Systemd#Ensure_.2Fusr_is_present_at_boot_time
Sep 11 01:34:09 <joseph2>	yeah, i wasnt sure if this was an optional step
Sep 11 01:34:54 <tdr>	fsck and friends are all under /usr/sbin
Sep 11 01:35:08 <joseph2>	hmm
Sep 11 01:49:27 <joseph2>	why is switching eselect profile from plain nothing to systemd taking a long time?
Sep 11 01:49:58 <kurly>	eselect profile should take several milliseconds
Sep 11 01:52:41 <joseph2>	dang, its saying its taking 100 percent cpu, and its uptime is 10 minutes...
Sep 11 01:53:24 <kurly>	'eselect profile set X' updates a symlink; it is strange that it would use any measurable amount of cpu
Sep 11 01:53:43 <wraeth>	Just to be sure, you mean the `eselect profile set ...` command is, or are you referring to rebuilding/updating @world after switching the symlink?
Sep 11 01:54:10 <joseph2>	just running eselect profile set 29
Sep 11 01:54:31 <wraeth>	That's unusual...
Sep 11 01:55:07 <joseph2>	hmm.... i guess ill just add the systemd useflag instead.
Sep 11 01:55:15 <kurly>	...
Sep 11 01:55:19 <wraeth>	No, you should be able to set the profile normally.
Sep 11 01:55:33 <joseph2>	haha
Sep 11 01:55:55 <wraeth>	Can you ctrl+c the command, then check output from `ls -l /etc/portage` and make sure make.profile is a valid symlink?
Sep 11 01:56:54 <josef64>	time eselect profile set 24
Sep 11 01:56:54 <josef64>	real    0m0,982s
Sep 11 01:57:03 <joseph2>	http://dpaste.com/0E7XE6J
Sep 11 01:57:51 <wraeth>	joseph2: Try running eselect again, and if it takes more than 10 seconds ctrl+c it again and we can try setting it manually.
Sep 11 01:58:49 <joseph2>	ok, it took longer than 10 seconds.
Sep 11 02:00:30 <wraeth>	Okay, use eselect to get the full name of the profile you want (the numbers won't always be the same across all systems), then run `ln -s ../..$(portageq get_repo_path / gentoo)/profiles/<the_profile_path> /etc/portage/make.profile`
Sep 11 02:00:30 <wraeth>	For example: ln -s ../..$(portageq get_repo_path / gentoo)/profiles/default/linux/amd64/17.1/systemd /etc/portage/make.profile
Sep 11 02:01:12 <wraeth>	Once done, use `eselect profile show` to check it's picked it up, then (for curiosities sake) try eselect profile set again.
Sep 11 02:03:02 <zxcat>	gn. I did installed NetworkManager, but I don't wish to have NetworkManager starting up at boot time. I removed from boot time using rc-update del NetworkManager, but even then, when I boot, NetworkManager starts again. Any suggestion to solve this problem or should I simply desinstall NetworkManager?
Sep 11 02:04:03 <wraeth>	zxcat: Use `rc-status -a` and check it's not in any other runlevels (NM is usually in 'default' not 'boot').
Sep 11 02:05:23 <joseph2>	thanks wraeth, that works http://dpaste.com/056KHAB. except i need to make sure not to call eselect profile set because it will unset it.
Sep 11 02:05:56 <zxcat>	wraeth: Dynamic Runlevel: needed/wanted ( dbus + NetworkManager ) >> What kind of "Service level are those" ?
Sep 11 02:06:47 <username234>	zxcat: that means you have something in one of the other runlevels that depends on those.
Sep 11 02:06:56 <wraeth>	joseph2: The fact that it's taking so long breaking it when called is concerning - as kurly said and josef64 demonstrated, it should take less than a second (and, you know, "work"). That being said, I'm not sure what might be breaking it. Someone else may have an idea though.
Sep 11 02:07:22 <zxcat>	username234: how to check service dependencies?
Sep 11 02:07:45 <username234>	zxcat: it's usually listed near the top of the init scripts.
Sep 11 02:11:46 <tdr>	i'd jsut grep -i networkmanager or whateverver its name was, in ./*  and see what lists it
Sep 11 02:16:16 <zxcat>	dbus and consolekit.. but even then, dbus is not a init service and consolekit was disabled by flag.. how to check which installed packages are using dbus flag?
Sep 11 02:17:15 <tdr>	qlist -ICU | grep dbus
Sep 11 02:17:44 <tdr>	dbus not an init service, you mean its not enabled?
Sep 11 02:18:30 <zxcat>	yes, I mean I didn't add it to init services
Sep 11 02:21:20 <zxcat>	yeah.. is somehow a strange behavior, since even dhcpcd is not a init service
Sep 11 02:21:46 <zxcat>	while in fact it does initialize at boot..
Sep 11 02:21:48 <tdr>	stuff can also be "hotplugged" and be "helpful"
Sep 11 02:22:07 <tdr>	aka starts on its own since it sees your network can and doesn't have a config etc
Sep 11 02:22:41 <zxcat>	you mean at kernel level, if hotplug is enable ?
Sep 11 02:23:01 <tdr>	nope
Sep 11 02:23:09 <tdr>	are you on openrc?
Sep 11 02:23:12 <zxcat>	 yes
Sep 11 02:23:31 <tdr>	look in /etc/rc.conf .. search for "hotplug"
Sep 11 02:23:59 <tdr>	i set mine to: rc_hotplug="!net.*" so its not being "helpful" and starting net.X services that i dont have enabled
Sep 11 02:24:08 <_Cute_Kitty_>	Hi i got owncloud almost working, the server is now up and accessible, but when creating an account it gives me the error "can't create or write into the apps-external directory"
Sep 11 02:24:14 <_Cute_Kitty_>	is this a permissions error?
Sep 11 02:24:52 <tdr>	yes
Sep 11 02:25:04 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so how do i grant access to the folder for everybody in gentoo
Sep 11 02:25:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	chown -R
Sep 11 02:25:20 <tdr>	whatever user the thing runs as cannot write to the directory its set to use for "apps-external"
Sep 11 02:25:57 <wokko>	zxcat: netmount can call dhcpcd which inturn can call networkmanager
Sep 11 02:26:04 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so what command do i run :(
Sep 11 02:26:12 <tdr>	netmount can also prob be disabled all together
Sep 11 02:27:47 <_Cute_Kitty_>	what group should i use
Sep 11 02:28:07 <tdr>	check what your thing runs as
Sep 11 02:28:16 <_Cute_Kitty_>	you mean owncloud
Sep 11 02:28:25 <_Cute_Kitty_>	how do i check what group this owncloud server is using
Sep 11 02:28:33 <_Cute_Kitty_>	what's the general command
Sep 11 02:29:08 <wokko>	_Cute_Kitty_: ls -l <path to directory>
Sep 11 02:29:14 <zxcat>	ty guys, lets test it
Sep 11 02:29:54 <_Cute_Kitty_>	wokko; that lists the files inside the directory
Sep 11 02:30:03 <tdr>	_Cute_Kitty_, ps aux | grep <some process name>
Sep 11 02:30:09 <tdr>	or ps aux   and just look
Sep 11 02:30:38 <wokko>	_Cute_Kitty_: yeah and also shows group/owner
Sep 11 02:31:30 <_Cute_Kitty_>	is group pid
Sep 11 02:31:40 <tdr>	wokko, files could eb owned by root but run as some lower user tho
Sep 11 02:32:35 <wokko>	tdr: true but just a quick way to find which group to use for others perms
Sep 11 02:32:47 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ps aux lists a bunch of stuff with apache in it but nothing with owncloud
Sep 11 02:32:54 <kerframil>	if it's a php application - which I suspect it might be - the applicable owner would be the username that the hosting php process runs as. what that is, in turn, depends on several other factors.
Sep 11 02:33:43 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: are you using mod_php or something else?
Sep 11 02:33:43 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so apache then
Sep 11 02:33:46 <_Cute_Kitty_>	apache2
Sep 11 02:33:51 <_Cute_Kitty_>	and php
Sep 11 02:34:16 <kerframil>	I haven't touched mod-php in a while but yeah - it's likely the same user that apache runs as then.
Sep 11 02:34:44 <kerframil>	you didn't answer the question, by the way.
Sep 11 02:34:53 <kerframil>	I realise you're using php. the question is how.
Sep 11 02:35:26 <kerframil>	see, apache can be used with php-fpm and such. mod_php isn't the only approach.
Sep 11 02:36:53 <_Cute_Kitty_>	mod_php
Sep 11 02:37:14 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so i typed chown -R myusername:apache then /var/www/localhost/htdocs/owncloud
Sep 11 02:37:23 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so that gives permissions to my username to run it?
Sep 11 02:37:32 <_Cute_Kitty_>	but how do i give permission to any web address to write to that directory
Sep 11 02:37:35 <kerframil>	no, that's silly. your own user should not have permission to write there.
Sep 11 02:37:45 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so what should be the user
Sep 11 02:37:47 <kerframil>	and now should apache, except where it is _needed_.
Sep 11 02:37:48 <_Cute_Kitty_>	all
Sep 11 02:38:04 <kerframil>	you should have adjusted only the directory that owncloud was complaining about.
Sep 11 02:38:12 <kerframil>	nor*
Sep 11 02:38:29 <kerframil>	if you can find it.
Sep 11 02:38:54 <kerframil>	it may also be that it doesn't exist, and owncloud is trying to create it, in which case you would have to figure out in which directory it is trying to be created. this sometimes happens.
Sep 11 02:39:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	now it just gives me a error when i load the owncloud page. https://imgur.com/a/GP2P8xm
Sep 11 02:39:29 <lovesegfault>	Why is the overlay index called zugaina?
Sep 11 02:39:47 <_Cute_Kitty_>	var/www/localhost/htdocs/owncloud/config directory does exist
Sep 11 02:39:53 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: you changed not only the effective user but the effective group for the entire directory tree ... side effects are to be expected.
Sep 11 02:40:02 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so how do i undo it lol
Sep 11 02:40:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	reinstall owncloud server?
Sep 11 02:40:29 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: I don't have a reference as to what the permissions were before. you might just be better off putting htdocs/owncloud aside and re-emerging at this point.
Sep 11 02:40:35 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yes
Sep 11 02:40:58 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so delete my localhost folder, rerun the webappconfig
Sep 11 02:41:00 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: make sure that owncloud is gone. at the very least, rename it so that it no longer overlaps with what will be re-installed.
Sep 11 02:41:08 <kerframil>	that should fix up the permissions.
Sep 11 02:41:17 <kurly>	lovesegfault: you'd have to ask the people that run it; it's not a gentoo official thing
Sep 11 02:41:40 <lovesegfault>	kurly: I see, is it a gentoo dev that runs it?
Sep 11 02:42:15 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: once it's back, run this please, from inside the htdocs dir: wgetpaste -c 'find owncloud -ls'
Sep 11 02:42:17 <kurly>	don't think so
Sep 11 02:43:25 <_Cute_Kitty_>	k
Sep 11 02:43:32 <_Cute_Kitty_>	thanks kerframil: got owncloud back
Sep 11 02:43:35 <_Cute_Kitty_>	now let me run that command
Sep 11 02:43:43 <wraeth>	_Cute_Kitty_: Before deleting your htdocs, you should probably copy your owncloud config.php so you don't have to write it again. Also, owncloud is an application that is run by the webserver. The webserver runs as a user (in your case, probably "apache") on the machine. Users in owncloud are unrelated to users on the system - owncloud (and, by extension, the web server) is what does stuff on the machine on behalf of the user in owncloud.
Sep 11 02:43:52 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: I'm just trying to get a sense of what the layout is for this application, and its default permissions.
Sep 11 02:44:25 <_Cute_Kitty_>	 http://dpaste.com/1YGWQP5
Sep 11 02:44:41 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: you need to be in the htdocs dir, as mentioned.
Sep 11 02:46:07 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: do you understand?
Sep 11 02:46:56 <_Cute_Kitty_>	it's too big.
Sep 11 02:47:03 <_Cute_Kitty_>	there's a whole ton of text and wgetpaste won't paste it
Sep 11 02:47:13 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: ok, just the dirs then: wgetpaste -c 'find owncloud -type d -ls'
Sep 11 02:47:18 <kerframil>	that'll do.
Sep 11 02:48:30 <_Cute_Kitty_>	http://dpaste.com/10N46WN
Sep 11 02:48:33 *	ChanServ gives voice to candrews
Sep 11 02:48:42 <_Cute_Kitty_>	oops sorry
Sep 11 02:48:44 <_Cute_Kitty_>	give me a sec
Sep 11 02:48:48 <kerframil>	ok.
Sep 11 02:49:20 <_Cute_Kitty_>	http://dpaste.com/0HFAP76
Sep 11 02:50:04 <kerframil>	interesting. we can see from this that apache already has ownership of part of the sub-tree.
Sep 11 02:50:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	btw its cloud because for some reason after i reran webconfig the resulting folder was /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cloud instead of /var/www/localhost/htdocs/owncloud for some reason
Sep 11 02:50:18 <_Cute_Kitty_>	anyway yeah
Sep 11 02:50:43 <kerframil>	the trick now is to find out what owncloud complains about, identify either the directory being referred to - or the directory in which it is trying to create a directory - then "chown apache" each on a case-by-case basis.
Sep 11 02:50:52 <kerframil>	so try to use owncloud and see what comes up first.
Sep 11 02:51:03 <_Cute_Kitty_>	you mean try loggin in
Sep 11 02:51:24 <kerframil>	yes. whatever it was you were doing that elicited the errors originally.
Sep 11 02:52:12 <_Cute_Kitty_>	https://imgur.com/a/63trLyh
Sep 11 02:52:16 <_Cute_Kitty_>	that is the error i am getting just now
Sep 11 02:52:59 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i don't actually have a directory inside the cloud named apps-externel
Sep 11 02:53:05 <kerframil>	so, there are two ways you could go about this.
Sep 11 02:53:39 <kerframil>	one is to create that exact path as a directory then chown it for apache. or, you could be a bit more liberal an chown apache its parent ("cloud"), which would allow it to create apps-external as a sub-directory anyway.
Sep 11 02:54:38 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i think i should just chown the cloud folder
Sep 11 02:54:44 <_Cute_Kitty_>	is that what you're saying with the second option
Sep 11 02:55:12 <kerframil>	yes. it's less secure but, as you are troubleshooting and it is not known which other directory will be created, it's not necessarily unreasonable.
Sep 11 02:55:18 <kerframil>	directories, even.
Sep 11 02:55:37 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yeah
Sep 11 02:55:43 <wraeth>	_Cute_Kitty_: Here's the directory ownership list for my owncloud instance. Note that I run using nginx not apache, so adjust accordingly. http://dpaste.com/02EF5TX
Sep 11 02:56:09 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so the command is chown -R (some user):apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cloud
Sep 11 02:56:11 <_Cute_Kitty_>	correct?
Sep 11 02:56:20 <kerframil>	no need for -R. don't get too trigger happy.
Sep 11 02:56:26 <_Cute_Kitty_>	isn't -R for folders?
Sep 11 02:56:27 <kerframil>	do what's needed but no more.
Sep 11 02:56:34 <kerframil>	it's for *recursing* directories.
Sep 11 02:56:41 <kerframil>	recursion isn't part of the solution right now.
Sep 11 02:56:47 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok. so what user should i put in
Sep 11 02:56:51 <kerframil>	apache
Sep 11 02:56:56 <kerframil>	just apache.
Sep 11 02:56:56 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so apache:apache
Sep 11 02:57:00 <kerframil>	just apache.
Sep 11 02:57:02 <_Cute_Kitty_>	omk
Sep 11 02:57:12 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so chown apache /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cloud
Sep 11 02:57:13 <kurly>	it feels like you are trying to create a problem instead of solve one ;)
Sep 11 02:57:21 <_Cute_Kitty_>	lol. i'm good at that believe me
Sep 11 02:57:38 <kerframil>	_Cute_Kitty_: also, judging by wraeth's output, there'll need to be a top-level config dir that apache can write to. this is very common for PHP apps, actually.
Sep 11 02:58:55 <kerframil>	I've lost your paste now, but if there's no "config" dir under "cloud/", create one and chown apache it.
Sep 11 02:59:16 <_Cute_Kitty_>	and if there is a config dir under cloud
Sep 11 02:59:19 <_Cute_Kitty_>	then chown it too?
Sep 11 02:59:23 <kerframil>	if needed, yes.
Sep 11 02:59:39 <kerframil>	you can bet your bottom dollar that it will need to be written to.
Sep 11 02:59:42 <kerframil>	during runtime.
Sep 11 03:00:36 <_Cute_Kitty_>	both done :)
Sep 11 03:00:39 <_Cute_Kitty_>	no errors
Sep 11 03:00:45 <_Cute_Kitty_>	so restart apache needed or not
Sep 11 03:00:49 <kerframil>	no restart required.
Sep 11 03:01:04 <_Cute_Kitty_>	ok i'll try creating account now
Sep 11 03:01:44 <_Cute_Kitty_>	it works :)  you rock kerframil:
Sep 11 03:01:47 <kerframil>	\o/
Sep 11 03:02:07 <_Cute_Kitty_>	thanks so much
Sep 11 03:02:17 <_Cute_Kitty_>	now i think i'm finally complete for the time being with my server setup
Sep 11 03:02:27 <_Cute_Kitty_>	i've got my tools, got my sync client, got my vnc server set up
Sep 11 03:02:49 <wraeth>	_Cute_Kitty_: I'd recommend installing a webserver on another machine somewhere that you can use to test and learn how apache, php and web applications work with the system.
Sep 11 03:06:14 <_Cute_Kitty_>	yeah, wraeth: I do want to learn how to do all this. I'm a newbie to Linux in general, but I find the best way to start learning is to just dive right in. Now that I know some of the basics of stuff like webservers, the installation process for gentoo, use flags, etc. i can dig deeper as i install on more systems, etc
Sep 11 03:06:17 <_Cute_Kitty_>	this is just the beginning :)
Sep 11 03:06:31 <wraeth>	:)
Sep 11 03:08:24 <_Cute_Kitty_>	have a good night all :)
Sep 11 03:36:29 <javashin>	hello
Sep 11 03:38:43 <javashin>	   does /dev/urandom and haveged have influence on the generated bzImage ? kernel image can a experimental haveged    break and corrupt a kernel img ????
Sep 11 03:39:11 <javashin>	or make a bad initramfs ?
Sep 11 03:39:21 <javashin>	broken corrupted ?
Sep 11 03:39:43 <Kangie>	javashin, unlikely, unless your compilation method was cat /dev/random > bzimage
Sep 11 03:39:57 <javashin>	hmm
Sep 11 03:40:00 <javashin>	ok
Sep 11 03:40:09 <Kangie>	What issue are you having?
Sep 11 03:40:26 <Kangie>	You compile your kernel + initramfs and it won't boot?
Sep 11 03:41:01 <javashin>	yes
Sep 11 03:41:07 <javashin>	i got black screen
Sep 11 03:41:11 <javashin>	and dont boot
Sep 11 03:41:23 <Kangie>	OK. Do you have other kernels that you've made installed?
Sep 11 03:41:46 <Kangie>	(as in, has it worked in the past?)
Sep 11 03:42:03 <javashin>	but i can boot from a kernel from arch with its initramfs changing the zpool dataset to point the root of gentoo
Sep 11 03:43:12 <javashin>	im running gentoo now booting with -zen kernel 5.2.14 -zen with a initramfs generated with mkinitcpio
Sep 11 03:43:15 <javashin>	on arch
Sep 11 03:43:23 <Kangie>	how are you building your kernel? With make or genkernel?
Sep 11 03:43:27 <javashin>	with the modules on my gentoo
Sep 11 03:43:30 <javashin>	make
Sep 11 03:45:01 <javashin>	i had installed haveged 1.9.6_pre and when the service was enabled systemd stallsand wont booted
Sep 11 03:45:42 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 11 03:45:49 <javashin>	after boot in single mode and disable haveged and rebooted the system just boot fine but still using the initramfs from arch
Sep 11 03:46:10 <javashin>	but my kernels are like broken
Sep 11 03:46:15 <kurly>	it is strange that when you use something that isn't in the gento repo, you might have problems
Sep 11 03:46:28 <kurly>	actually, wait, that doesn't sound strange at all
Sep 11 03:47:07 <Kangie>	kurly, sys-apps/haveged
Sep 11 03:47:32 <kurly>	Kangie: 1.9.6_pre
Sep 11 03:47:41 <Kangie>	ah, I did miss that.
Sep 11 03:47:49 <javashin>	yes is from poly-c
Sep 11 03:48:32 <javashin>	so i ask again broken sys-apps/haveged make urandom break things ?
Sep 11 03:48:41 <javashin>	maybe or not likely ?
Sep 11 03:49:45 <tdr>	define "break things" because urandom is a "pool" of randomness.  if it's empty, sure, apps will not be happy.  but if gibberish is found there, that is what is expected
Sep 11 03:50:35 <javashin>	ih man new chromium 77.0.3865.75	 and i dont have firefox69 yet
Sep 11 03:50:51 <javashin>	but first i have to fix my system
Sep 11 03:53:52 <javashin>	so gibberish > good , empty > not good
Sep 11 03:54:34 <Kangie>	javashin, if your bootloader is loading your kernel, have you tried booting the kernel with different command line options to see where it gets stuck?
Sep 11 03:54:46 <Kangie>	ie, debug?
Sep 11 03:54:52 <javashin>	yes
Sep 11 03:55:04 <Kangie>	so still no output?
Sep 11 03:55:08 <javashin>	black screen all the time
Sep 11 03:55:09 <tdr>	javashin, yes, urandom should be chaos, but not empty
Sep 11 03:55:11 <javashin>	yes
Sep 11 03:55:32 <javashin>	hmm im using grub only
Sep 11 03:55:40 <javashin>	let me try systemd-boot
Sep 11 03:55:40 <tdr>	black screen can be bad framebuffer.  it could be continuing but not displaying
Sep 11 03:55:45 <Kangie>	yeah
Sep 11 03:55:56 <Kangie>	what about the standard 'nomodeset' and whatever graphics options you need?

Sep 11 11:14:17 <kaste>	yes X. No, no Events
Sep 11 11:31:37 <kaste>	AFAICT No dmesg entries either, Kangie
Sep 11 11:32:00 <kaste>	Maybe I'll try playing with xev
Sep 11 11:32:46 <kaste>	yeah, when it failes to register a two finger scroll it shows zero entries on xev
Sep 11 11:32:58 <kaste>	No signal at all
Sep 11 11:35:38 <kaste>	when it works, I have a flurry of events for button 4 and 5 which should be mouse wheel scrolling from what I remember
Sep 11 11:35:55 <kaste>	seems like libinput internally has trouble detecting the scroll
Sep 11 11:40:37 <Kangie>	hm.
Sep 11 11:40:40 <Kangie>	That is odd.
Sep 11 12:10:28 <iterati>	Any ideas about "error while loading shared libraries: libexpat.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" ? While on chroot, I set profile 17.1, then switched back to 17. That caused the error or not relevant ?
Sep 11 12:10:47 <iterati>	The stage3 that is available to download is 17, I guess ?
Sep 11 12:12:24 <Kelsar>	by now they should be 17.1
Sep 11 12:13:18 <username234>	iterati: switching from 17 to 17.1 (or the other way around) is not trivial.
Sep 11 12:13:36 <username234>	iterati: when you switched did you do anything beyond just selecting the profile?
Sep 11 12:15:03 <iterati>	username234: I don't remember exactly,  I don't think so. It's during the installation still.
Sep 11 12:15:17 <username234>	iterati: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gentoo-mirror/gentoo/stable/metadata/news/2019-06-05-amd64-17-1-profiles-are-now-stable/2019-06-05-amd64-17-1-profiles-are-now-stable.en.txt
Sep 11 12:15:26 <BtbN>	You should use a stage3 which already comes with 17.1, and stay on it.
Sep 11 12:16:25 <iterati>	BtbN: I thought it was 17... well, maybe that caused the issues then.
Sep 11 12:16:50 <BtbN>	Switching a 17.1 stage3 to 17.0 whould definitely cause such breakage, yes
Sep 11 12:17:54 <iterati>	hmmm, I guess I need to purge it then. Need to umount everything or just clean the root disk and try again ?
Sep 11 12:19:10 <Triffid_Hunter>	iterati: clean root and go again
Sep 11 12:19:32 <Triffid_Hunter>	iterati: profile switch just means a bunch of files are in the wrong spot, no need to reformat the filesystem
Sep 11 12:19:57 <Kelsar>	Triffid_Hunter: while you are correct, in that case it likely is easier
Sep 11 12:20:01 <Triffid_Hunter>	although in some cases I guess it might be faster to reformat
Sep 11 12:20:09 <Kelsar>	he still is in chroot phase
Sep 11 12:20:32 <Triffid_Hunter>	if you have ext4 on spinning rust, it'll almost certainly be faster to reformat since iirc ext is really slow to delete things
Sep 11 12:21:35 <iterati>	Triffid_Hunter: yeah, thanks. Still on chroot, though... going to exit and try to delete first everything, except boot & home that mounted to separate partitons.

Sep 11 13:00:08 <Cyp_>	Except now the incompatible versions are stable.
Sep 11 13:16:56 <m_ben>	ever since I updated to genkernel 4, it takes 10min to generate an initramfs. this is crazy, before it took less than a minute. why does it take so long now?
Sep 11 13:20:56 <Triffid_Hunter>	still can't sync, strace suggests that it's due to https://bpaste.net/show/yWqa
Sep 11 13:27:06 <josef64>	Triffid_Hunter: is here a error message from `emerge --sync gentoo`?
Sep 11 13:27:23 <needle>	Heya, is there a way to deactivate the coredumps creation on gentoo, if applications crash?
Sep 11 13:28:08 <Triffid_Hunter>	josef64: yeah emerge --sync gets stuck trying to fetch keys
Sep 11 13:28:16 <Triffid_Hunter>	keeps complaining that "OpenPGP keyring refresh failed: gpg: refreshing 4 keys from hkps://keys.gentoo.org gpg: keyserver refresh failed: No keyserver available"
Sep 11 13:28:36 <Triffid_Hunter>	and that gpg2 paste seems to be the underlying command that's failing
Sep 11 13:30:54 <josef64>	Triffid_Hunter: Hm, here was a bug in stage3 (long time ago), not sure, try a net-libs/gnutls rebuild
Sep 11 13:31:33 <Triffid_Hunter>	josef64: I synced and emerged world about a week ago, was fine then
Sep 11 13:31:59 <Triffid_Hunter>	Tue May 21 21:17:55 2019 >>> net-libs/gnutls-3.6.7 seems recent enough, no?
Sep 11 13:32:58 <josef64>	Oh, then it should work. Sorry, no idea then :-/
Sep 11 13:33:36 <josef64>	gnutls-3.6.7 version was irrelevant, a rebuild fixed it
Sep 11 13:34:10 <josef64>	emerge -av1 net-libs/gnutls
Sep 11 13:34:26 <Triffid_Hunter>	I've added 'dane' use flag, maybe that'll help
Sep 11 13:37:43 <Triffid_Hunter>	josef64: no dice, same issue
Sep 11 13:38:00 <josef64>	meh :-/
Sep 11 13:38:20 <Triffid_Hunter>	josef64: I found some threads from last year saying an update to gemato-14 fixed things then, but I already have 14.1
Sep 11 13:39:31 *	ChanServ gives voice to nicolasbock
Sep 11 13:44:23 <Triffid_Hunter>	curious, seems like emerge is spawning dozens of gpg-agent and dirmngr processes
Sep 11 13:56:51 <i-node>	http://dpaste.com/2Q051BA
Sep 11 13:56:53 <i-node>	I don't understand it, electron needs a higher version than gn-0.1583, but gn-0.1616 is scheduled for merge?
Sep 11 13:57:03 <i-node>	where is the problem?
Sep 11 13:57:22 <i-node>	ah, not higher, less than
Sep 11 13:58:21 <i-node>	so, if I install a newer electron version, it could solve the problem?
Sep 11 14:01:32 <freakynl>	i-node: that would depend on what the newer version depends on, but generally you can assume newer versions works with newer versions (but as always, assumptions are evil)
Sep 11 14:02:36 <i-node>	freakynl: and if the newer version doesn't solves the problem? are there any workaround or I should wait for portage to solve it with newer versions?
Sep 11 14:21:57 <freakynl>	i-node: mostly it just warns and skips some packages, most of the times it will (eventually) go away on it's own when stuff is updated. There's a large relation with the software however, if it's seldom updated and won't get support for a new library in the upcoming 2 years there isn't much gentoo can do about it
Sep 11 14:23:27 <Iyra>	I'm installing gentoo with MBR and LUKS (without LVM and without systemd) only on the root partition with a password (not a keyfile). What are the steps I need to take so that GRUB will see the partition and ask for a password when it mounts? I don't have an fstab yet.
Sep 11 14:25:47 <i-node>	http://dpaste.com/2W93FCQ
Sep 11 14:25:57 <i-node>	freakynl: I don't understand, for example, why this doesn't work
Sep 11 14:27:32 <i-node>	also, the electron conflict had dissapeared by itself
Sep 11 14:28:02 <username234>	i-node: ~net-print/hplip-3.19.6 required by (net-print/hplip-plugin-3.19.6:0/0::gentoo, ebuild scheduled for merge)
Sep 11 14:28:37 <i-node>	username234: but recompiling hplip-plugin with the newer version should solve the problem
Sep 11 14:28:47 <username234>	i-node: and which version is that?
Sep 11 14:29:00 <i-node>	username234:~net-print/hplip-3.19.8
Sep 11 14:29:07 <i-node>	username234: =net-print/hplip-3.19.8
Sep 11 14:29:09 <username234>	that's hplip,
Sep 11 14:29:14 <username234>	not hplip-plugin
Sep 11 14:30:00 <i-node>	username234: but the problem is that hplip-plugin is compiled against =net-print/hplip-3.19.6 ... upgrading hplip and recompiling hplip-plugin should solve it
Sep 11 14:30:12 <username234>	i-node: no
Sep 11 14:30:55 <username234>	i-node: hplip-plugin-3.19.6 requires hplip-3.19.6.
Sep 11 14:31:29 <i-node>	username234: isn't it when there is an = in front of the atom?
Sep 11 14:31:29 <username234>	if you want to install hplip-3.19.8, you need to uninstall hplip-plugin or install hplip-plugin-3.19.8
Sep 11 14:32:52 <username234>	~net-print/hplip-3.19.6 means it needs hplip-3.19.6 or hplip-3.19.6-rX where X >= 1.
Sep 11 14:33:07 <i-node>	username234: thank you so much
Sep 11 14:34:26 <i-node>	username234: where can i find info about these messages? I cannot find it in man emerge
Sep 11 14:35:38 <username234>	i-node: might try man portage.
Sep 11 14:35:46 <i-node>	ok, thank you again
Sep 11 14:37:20 <username234>	i-node: and it looks like upstream released hplip-plugin-3.19.8, so it would probably show up in the gentoo repo in a few days.
Sep 11 14:38:26 <i-node>	:)
Sep 11 14:39:11 <i-node>	there are months since my latest world upgrade :D
Sep 11 14:39:51 <tuxick>	anyone knows how to parse "x11-libs/cairo-1.16.0-r3::gentoo (masked by: )
Sep 11 14:40:05 <tuxick>	? masked by nothing sounds like not masked to me
Sep 11 14:40:30 <i-node>	try --autounmask-write
Sep 11 14:40:39 <tuxick>	tried that before
Sep 11 14:40:46 <tuxick>	but i'll try again
Sep 11 14:41:22 <grknight>	tuxick: try --autounmask=n to get the real error
Sep 11 14:41:43 <fling>	Is there an initscript for properly discarding swap devices?
Sep 11 14:42:51 <grknight>	fling: there needs to be one?
Sep 11 14:43:06 <fling>	idk sounds like it might be useable
Sep 11 14:43:08 <tuxick>	what's the purpose anyway?
Sep 11 14:43:25 <fling>	for discarding swap blockdevices before activating
Sep 11 14:43:38 <fling>	or maybe after deactivating
Sep 11 14:43:39 <tuxick>	huh?
Sep 11 14:43:48 <ajak>	app-misc/hello is useable but that doesn't mean it really has a purpose
Sep 11 14:43:54 <grknight>	fling: swapon looks at fstab for discard activation and policy
Sep 11 14:44:29 <fling>	ok, should work for zfs swap thanks
Sep 11 14:45:37 <fling>	oh!
Sep 11 14:45:51 <fling>	discard=once would be good for ssd swap
Sep 11 14:46:14 <fling>	grknight: actually /etc/init.d/swap discards swap with swapon if this is specified in fstab, thanks!
Sep 11 15:06:16 <chymera>	hi guys, I am still having issues with skypeforlinux (did a global update and reinstalled it and restarted the machine). When I click the icon or execute it from the CLI, it fails to start with no error message
Sep 11 15:18:59 <Polynomial-C>	chymera: try to run it with strace or gdb
Sep 11 15:24:58 <noodlepie>	My Gentoo reinstallion is working perfectly now - I downloaded the wrote ISO and Stage3 - the i686 versions when I have AMD64 - it caused all manner of kernel compile errors - thankfully the amd versions of the files worked perfectly
Sep 11 15:25:23 <minyu>	chymera: you can try install it by snapd. https://github.com/zigford/snapd
Sep 11 15:28:19 <Necktwi>	i got rtx 2060 along with igpu intel uhd 630
Sep 11 15:29:01 <chymera>	Polynomial-C: what package provides gdb?
Sep 11 15:29:02 <Necktwi>	to switch between these graphics, i read i should use optimus or bumblebee
Sep 11 15:29:18 <Necktwi>	which one should i choose?
Sep 11 15:29:18 <Polynomial-C>	chymera: sys-devel/gdb
Sep 11 15:31:17 <Necktwi>	I've connected my monitor to nvidia gpu. does these graphics switchers allow me to use igpu when monitor is connected to nvidia gpu?
Sep 11 15:32:28 <chymera>	Polynomial-C: can you also help me interpret the strace output? I really can't tell what's happening there http://dpaste.com/20WSWRB
Sep 11 15:32:34 <grknight>	Necktwi: often in optimus, the nvidia gpu is not physically connected and instead routed via the intel to the display.  not sure if that's normal or the case for you
Sep 11 15:33:25 <Necktwi>	i decided to use bumblebee as it is opensource
Sep 11 15:33:46 <grknight>	and obsolete
Sep 11 15:33:52 <Necktwi>	oh
Sep 11 15:34:22 <Necktwi>	ok optimus then
Sep 11 15:34:43 <twnqx>	Necktwi: all of that is meant for laptops and not desktops with your own add-in video card
Sep 11 15:34:52 <grknight>	the way bumblebee works is create a second xorg-server without a screen output and then pipes it to the first server
Sep 11 15:34:53 <twnqx>	just to be sure.
Sep 11 15:36:30 <grknight>	and yes, on a desktop, the iGPU should be flat out disabled by the system firmware when there's a discreet GPU like radeon or nvidia
Sep 11 15:36:49 <twnqx>	nah, you can use it as a separate card
Sep 11 15:37:34 <grknight>	this is how it was historically and I honestly don't use them so I cannot say recently
Sep 11 15:37:48 <Necktwi>	I found out that though i've merged gnome-light with global use=wayland and VIDEO_CARDS="intel i965 nvidia vmware virtualbox"
Sep 11 15:38:15 <grknight>	why vmware and virtualbox?
Sep 11 15:38:15 <freakynl>	Ycarus: you SNAT your v6?
Sep 11 15:38:19 <Necktwi>	my gnome is not using wayland
Sep 11 15:39:18 <Necktwi>	when playing assassin's creed odyssey on windows i run gentoo on the physical partition with virtualbox or vmware
Sep 11 15:39:22 <Polynomial-C>	chymera: I am not really that good in reading strace output. But I find this line suspicious:
Sep 11 15:39:25 <Polynomial-C>	ioctl(2, TIOCGWINSZ, 0x7ffe42ded1d0)    = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
Sep 11 15:40:22 <chymera>	Polynomial-C: so the binary compiled on the wrong architecture? Unlikely I'd say
Sep 11 15:40:31 <chymera>	also, Skype worked 2 weeks ago
Sep 11 15:40:50 <chymera>	in the meantime I updated my system twice and kernel once, so many things might have changed
Sep 11 15:40:57 <chymera>	but not the architecture of the system
Sep 11 15:41:09 <Necktwi>	i made different vitual boot disk with different kernel and appropriate runlevel with init script that should moderate the change
Sep 11 15:41:12 <chymera>	nor the skype binary
Sep 11 15:41:33 <Polynomial-C>	chymera: have you tried to remove the kype config files in your user's home (make a backup first!) and try to run Sykpe?
Sep 11 15:43:46 <Necktwi>	grknight, did i mess up?
Sep 11 15:44:31 <grknight>	Necktwi: why those drivers?  is this a VM guest?
Sep 11 15:44:46 <Necktwi>	i made different vitual boot disk with different kernel and appropriate runlevel with init script that should moderate the change
Sep 11 15:45:00 <Necktwi>	when playing assassin's creed odyssey on windows i run gentoo on the physical partition with virtualbox or vmware
Sep 11 15:45:20 <Necktwi>	grknight, ^

Sep 11 15:48:29 <chymera>	Polynomial-C: yes, I did
Sep 11 15:48:43 <Polynomial-C>	chymera: still no success?
Sep 11 15:48:59 <chymera>	I thought the issu was that it starts and goes to tray and GNOME no longer has a tray, but `ps aux` doesn't show it either
Sep 11 15:49:23 <chymera>	Polynomial-C: nope, still none :-/
Sep 11 15:49:47 <Polynomial-C>	chymera: I suppose when you said (opened in CLI), you meant the gnome terminal?
Sep 11 15:50:18 <Necktwi>	ok ok just forget all the above. my question is I want to get the wayland to work using intel gpu, i came to know nvidia drivers won't support wayland and gdm fallsback to X11.
Sep 11 15:50:41 <chymera>	Polynomial-C: yes
Sep 11 15:51:31 <Necktwi>	Now if i connect my monitor to motherboard hdmi port(intel gpu) does gdm starts the wayland session?

Sep 11 15:55:03 <HuggyBear>	i saw this morning that vixie-cron is dead. is cronie a drop in replacement or are there migration steps i need to go through?

Sep 11 15:56:48 <Polynomial-C>	HuggyBear: cronie is froked off from vixie-cron with the intention to be a drop-in replacement.
Sep 11 15:57:30 <grknight>	though if you want cronie to act like vixie-cron, disable the anacron USE

Sep 11 16:41:58 <javashin>	oh god i cant still produce a kernel that boots up
Sep 11 16:42:30 <javashin>	my system is f*ck Up
Sep 11 16:42:47 <iamben>	yesterday you didnt seem to keen on trying the things we were actually suggesting in this channel
Sep 11 16:42:52 <javashin>	no idea what to do
Sep 11 16:42:58 <iamben>	you were just throwing random stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck, and nothing did
Sep 11 16:43:57 <iamben>	i tried to get you to systematically test one part at a time, you wouldn't do that
Sep 11 16:44:16 <javashin>	i did everything
Sep 11 16:44:21 <javashin>	for sure
Sep 11 16:44:28 <javashin>	was not grub
Sep 11 16:44:37 <iamben>	start with your working setup and change one thing at a time
Sep 11 16:44:38 <javashin>	anyway
Sep 11 16:44:39 <flippingBits>	"23:40:06       javashin | problem solved" Did it break again?
Sep 11 16:44:54 <javashin>	never was fixed
Sep 11 16:45:13 <javashin>	every kernel i compile inside this gentoo got stuck in a black screen
Sep 11 16:45:47 <javashin>	if i throw kernels compiled on other gentoos arches gentoo'nomultilib they
Sep 11 16:45:50 <javashin>	work
Sep 11 16:46:03 <javashin>	but not the ones inside my current system
Sep 11 16:46:30 <iamben>	does your 5.2.13 kernel still work?
Sep 11 16:47:36 <josef64>	5.2.13-gentoo (not the -zen)
Sep 11 16:48:13 <iamben>	can you try rebuilding that very same kernel, with the same config, with newest genkernel?
Sep 11 16:48:22 <javashin>	nothing works
Sep 11 16:48:30 <iamben>	you tried exactly that, already?
Sep 11 16:48:52 <javashin>	i tried all the sources from 5.2.11 to 5.2.14
Sep 11 16:48:54 <javashin>	-gentoo
Sep 11 16:48:57 <javashin>	-pf
Sep 11 16:48:59 <javashin>	-zen
Sep 11 16:49:11 <javashin>	compiled in my system all of them got stuck
Sep 11 16:49:14 <iamben>	stop trying those other patchsets, they are garbage

Sep 11 16:49:24 <javashin>	with systemd-boot grub refind
Sep 11 16:49:30 <iamben>	so you cannot even get a new build of 5.2.13 working? only the old one works?
Sep 11 16:49:38 <flippingBits>	javashin: you have a booting system, before doing a kernel update right?
Sep 11 16:49:46 <javashin>	yes
Sep 11 16:49:47 <flippingBits>	had*
Sep 11 16:50:13 <iamben>	are you 100% sure you're using the working config? get it from /proc/config.gz when booted to the working kernel
Sep 11 16:50:20 <iamben>	do not use an on-disk one
Sep 11 16:50:28 <flippingBits>	can you boot that kernel that previously worked? Do you have that config that previously worked?
Sep 11 16:51:45 <javashin>	im on it now booted with -zen precompiled kernel which have all the modules i need , i just dropped in gentoo and do xz -d */*/*/*/*/* on the modules dir to get all the ko's out ko.xz and make them compatible with genkernel-next and make a initramfs and boot fine
Sep 11 16:51:58 <iamben>	so still you refuse to do what i suggest
Sep 11 16:52:03 <javashin>	flippingBits, yes i used all my stored configs
Sep 11 16:52:09 <javashin>	working ones
Sep 11 16:52:11 <iamben>	you just want to do your own thing and whine about failing

Sep 11 17:22:12 <flippingBits>	hmmm, I know my bitcoin stuff comes from Luke's overlay, but any idea why my cross compilers show up as from an overlay?  http://dpaste.com/31S9ETD
Sep 11 17:23:07 <iamben>	flippingBits: crossdev generates ebuilds and has to dump them into some overlay, ideally you should create a dedicated one beforehand.  unfortunately if you don't, it dumps them into one of your eixsting overlays.
Sep 11 17:23:19 <_wuseman>	add -f5,8 for print wich overlay it is javashin
Sep 11 17:26:02 <flippingBits>	iamben: That makes sense, can I move it all to a dedicated overlay now? I also removed the anders-larson overlay, as I'm not sure why I added it to start with.
Sep 11 17:26:13 <iamben>	flippingBits: yeah.  i think it's a good idea to do that.

Sep 12 10:17:27 <doc235>	i get nothing
Sep 12 10:27:34 <honigkuchen>	this https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=691492 does not help me
Sep 12 10:28:15 <honigkuchen>	there are patches from gentoo for compiling Tensorflow 1.14, but they be also needed for 1.13.1
Sep 12 10:28:53 <honigkuchen>	but emerge does net let me to copy those patch files, and says it does not know that renamed copied patches
Sep 12 10:29:55 <nixi>	i am having a weird issue with cron (dcron). i am trying to run a script from my home folder and i keep getting return code 2 for some reason.
Sep 12 10:30:00 <nixi>	http://dpaste.com/3VXE5Z8
Sep 12 10:30:03 <nixi>	here is my script
Sep 12 10:30:03 <honigkuchen>	>>> Verifying ebuild manifests
Sep 12 10:30:04 <honigkuchen>	!!! A file is not listed in the Manifest: '/usr/portage/sci-libs/tensorflow/files/tensorflow-1.13.0-0002-install_headers-fix-paths-of-generated-headers.patch'
Sep 12 10:30:29 <nixi>	and i have this in my crontab: `* * * * * /bin/sh /home/nixi/.bgrand.sh >/dev/null 2>&1`
Sep 12 10:30:39 <nixi>	editing as a normal user
Sep 12 10:31:09 <honigkuchen>	no one in bugs.gentoo.org reported this problems after that renaming

Sep 12 10:31:41 <nixi>	i am not sure what i might be doing wrong
Sep 12 10:37:06 <anenigma>	honigkuchen: don't put the extra patch file in /usr/portage, but instead into /etc/portage/patches/sci-libs/tensorflow-1.13.0/. That makes it a "user patch" and portage won't check for it in the Manifest
Sep 12 10:37:24 <anenigma>	honigkuchen: more info available on this directory at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/patches
Sep 12 10:39:56 <anenigma>	nixi: cron doesn't run from within your X environment, so feh doesn't know about your desktop environment, and therefore how to set your desktop wallpaper. adding "DISPLAY=:0" to your script "should" fix it
Sep 12 10:40:27 <nixi>	anenigma, ok, i am going to try that. good point
Sep 12 10:40:41 <nixi>	i thought it would use the same environment as it is run under my user
Sep 12 10:40:47 <anenigma>	nixi: googling for "feh background DISPLAY" gives a few sites that offer more clear explanations too :)
Sep 12 10:41:07 <Triffid_Hunter>	honigkuchen: tensorflow 1.14 works fine for me after downgrading bazel to <0.27
Sep 12 10:41:17 <anenigma>	nixi: crond is usually started outside of X. i don't know for sure how your system is set up, but i assume it's similar
Sep 12 10:41:28 <Triffid_Hunter>	honigkuchen: also don't go dropping patches in /usr/portage, that's what /etc/portage/patches/ is for
Sep 12 10:45:24 <nixi>	hmmm, still not working
Sep 12 10:45:38 <nixi>	is there a more detailed log?
Sep 12 10:46:09 <honigkuchen>	Triffid_Hunter: is bazel the reason why I need 1.13.1 and can not use  1.14 ?
Sep 12 10:48:26 <nixi>	oh wait, when i set the variable in crontab instead of the script, it works
Sep 12 10:48:43 <nixi>	* * * * * DISPLAY=:0 /bin/sh /home/nixi/.bgrand.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

Sep 12 10:49:19 <lovesegfault>	No idea how to get around this for the time being
Sep 12 10:53:53 <nixi>	lovesegfault, this might be a shitty idea, but what about deleting the package, emnerging the update and reinstalling it afterwards?
Sep 12 10:54:29 <lovesegfault>	nixi: You mean emerge -C?
Sep 12 10:55:14 <doc235>	use emerge -c lower case to get it's depndency's
Sep 12 10:55:25 <lovesegfault>	doc235: Yeah, I was about to say I don't use emerge -C :P
Sep 12 10:56:41 <nixi>	i would use -c and if that will not work, i would force it\
Sep 12 10:59:19 <w1d3m0d3>	what flag provides qemu's -netdelay? I need it for android emulation for some reason
Sep 12 11:00:31 <freakynl>	Is this something I should be worried about? The virtual size is insane, but residential is very little:    3091 freaky    39  19  256,2g  13900      0 S   0,0   0,1   0:03.79 baloo_file

Sep 12 11:03:36 <Triffid_Hunter>	honigkuchen: no idea, why do you need 1.13?
Sep 12 11:05:06 <honigkuchen>	Triffid_Hunter because maybe sys-apps/hwloc and sys-cluster/openmpi
Sep 12 11:14:20 <Kobboi>	lovesegfault:  emerge --unmerge $(eix -I --only-names 'app-text/docbook*') did work for me, but you might still want to get mgorny's opinion on the blocker

Sep 12 13:23:22 <redsh>	You appear to have 4GB of system memory and it's detecting a 4GB stick in the other slot, so I'm guessing it's right.

Sep 12 13:38:22 <Fersure>	hi everyone, I've been having some issues with portage
Sep 12 13:38:53 <Fersure>	http://dpaste.com/3NJ0SVE
Sep 12 13:38:56 <Fersure>	here is what is happening
Sep 12 13:39:13 <Fersure>	I'm not sure how to resolve this - vim really doesn't like my python targets...
Sep 12 13:39:30 <wokko>	newbieG: That flipkart might have the laptop with 2 x 2G sticks
Sep 12 13:40:37 <Sur3>	Fersure, you have to set the python single target to python2_7 as well, btw why dont u use the default python 3 targets?
Sep 12 13:40:56 <Fersure>	Sur3: http://dpaste.com/217AZT0
Sep 12 13:41:02 <Fersure>	this is what I have r.e. python right now
Sep 12 13:41:14 <Fersure>	I assumed it would be okay with either
Sep 12 13:41:29 <Fersure>	I want to use python3.7 and fallback to 2 for software which isn't on 3 yet
Sep 12 13:41:31 <Fersure>	that's all
Sep 12 13:41:48 <wokko>	Sur3: run 'dispatch-conf' then try 'perl-cleaner --all' for those perl ones
Sep 12 13:43:25 <Sur3>	wokko, thx
Sep 12 13:44:25 <Sur3>	Fersure, well that vim seems not to support python 3.7 yet, so set signle target for that package to 2.7 or install python 3.6 as well..
Sep 12 13:45:14 <Sur3>	Fersure, or update to a newer verison of vim
Sep 12 13:45:57 <Sur3>	Fersure, did u try if it works with vim-8.1.1846 ?
Sep 12 13:46:28 <Fersure>	http://dpaste.com/2P6YV55
Sep 12 13:46:31 <Fersure>	see this
Sep 12 13:47:05 <Fersure>	oh
Sep 12 13:47:09 <Fersure>	not working, sorry
Sep 12 13:48:07 <Fersure>	https://paste.lucko.me/bZVHBecwiS
Sep 12 13:48:10 <Fersure>	Sur3: see above
Sep 12 13:48:27 <wokko>	Fersure: Its blocked for stable vim you will need an ~arch version to use python3_7 with it
Sep 12 13:49:45 <Sur3>	Fersure, yeah i see version 8.1.1846 is there whats the problem? and how did u generate that output anyway, never saw that kind of output?
Sep 12 13:50:15 <Fersure>	using eix
Sep 12 13:50:30 <Fersure>	wokko: sorry, I'm fairly new to gentoo. do you know if there's info on how to do that in the docs?
Sep 12 13:50:39 <Fersure>	I'm hitting some what of a deadend
Sep 12 13:50:58 <Sur3>	>=python-3.7 is ~arch as well, so wonder how he could enable that without knowing about ~arch..
Sep 12 13:51:28 <Fersure>	I had help from a friend during the install, he's not around right now
Sep 12 13:51:32 <Sur3>	ahh i dropped eix some while ago, but it seems to have gotten some nice outputs maybe i should try that again
Sep 12 13:51:35 <Fersure>	and I haven't used gentoo in around 7 or 8 years sadly
Sep 12 13:52:07 <wokko>	Fersure: for vim you would 'echo 'app-editors/vim' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords && emerge -av vim
Sep 12 13:52:45 <Sur3>	Fersure, but do u really need python-3.7? managing the system will be easier is u use the stable 3.6 version, because python-3.7 is in testing that means you have to unmask many other packages as testing as well..
Sep 12 13:55:01 <Sur3>	still wonder if i should make a bug report about emerge not updating packages automatically..
Sep 12 13:55:18 <wokko>	Fersure: with python3_7 you will need to unmask the stable block by creating a file ' /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask' with '-python_targets_python3_7'
Sep 12 13:56:31 <wokko>	also '-python_single_target_python3_7' ib there too
Sep 12 13:56:32 <Sur3>	I never heard of this stable mask, is it documented somewhere?
Sep 12 13:57:22 <wokko>	Sur3: its a file in /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/
Sep 12 13:57:54 <wokko>	Sur3: also 'man portage'
Sep 12 14:01:53 <Sur3>	wokko, ahh is this stable-mask related to () brakets around use flags in emerge?
Sep 12 14:02:04 <wokko>	correct
Sep 12 14:02:42 <Sur3>	ok always was wondering about those braktes but always worked out without those stable masks somehow xD
Sep 12 14:03:08 <wokko>	well () usual profile mask for different sorts of reasons which are all in /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/*
Sep 12 14:05:14 <wokko>	Sur3: I normally just grep the whole dir eg for Fersure python3_7 i did 'grep -R python3_7 /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/' which found '/var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/arch/amd64/use.stable.mask:python_targets_python3_7'
Sep 12 14:06:34 <wokko>	Sur3: then if you look at that file it tells you the reason why the mask was placed
Sep 12 14:07:29 <Sur3>	# grep -R python3_7 /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/                                  >root@kappa<
Sep 12 14:07:29 <Sur3>	grep: /var/db/repos/gentoo/profiles/: Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden
Sep 12 14:07:42 <Sur3>	Doesnt find that file..
Sep 12 14:08:32 <Sur3>	probably an eix feature then ^^
Sep 12 14:08:35 <wokko>	Sur3: is /var/db/repos/gentoo/ where you portage tree is
Sep 12 14:09:10 <wokko>	Sur3: or are you still on /usr/portage
Sep 12 14:09:13 <Sur3>	ahh thats ur portage tree, no mine is in default /usr/portage location ^^"
Sep 12 14:09:26 <Sur3>	still?
Sep 12 14:09:58 <wokko>	Sur3: kool try 'grep -R python3_7 /usr/portage/profiles'
Sep 12 14:11:27 <Sur3>	so did default portage tree location change recently?
Sep 12 14:11:44 <Sur3>	cant find any news in eselect about that..?
Sep 12 14:12:10 <wokko>	Sur3: yeah couple of months ago
Sep 12 14:12:47 <Sur3>	is also still have a symlink in /etc/make.conf xD
Sep 12 14:13:04 <Fersure>	I installed my gentoo very recently
Sep 12 14:13:37 <wokko>	Sur3: must be an old system
Sep 12 14:14:14 <Sur3>	wokko, yeah a stage4 tarball from my old system to be more precisly.. xD
Sep 12 14:14:17 <wokko>	Fersure: did you get python3_7 up and going?
Sep 12 14:14:56 <wokko>	Sur3: kool, stage4, I think I still have a script for that somewhere
Sep 12 14:15:54 <Sur3>	yes i also have some scripts for that in my /local/bin ^^
Sep 12 14:16:31 <Sur3>	tar cvJf $1.txz -X /local/bin/stage4.excl /
Sep 12 14:16:49 <Sur3>	the tricky part is that excl file of course ^^"
Sep 12 14:17:38 <Fersure>	wokko: yes, thank you! :)
Sep 12 14:17:38 <wokko>	Sur3: mine is here http://ix.io/1nlT
Sep 12 14:17:50 <wokko>	Fersure: Kool
Sep 12 14:18:01 <Fersure>	it seems running `emerge -uDU @world` is fixing things up for me
Sep 12 14:18:08 <Fersure>	I fixed my use flags as well
Sep 12 14:18:15 <Sur3>	wokko, wow kool that looks at least much more complicated than my script xD
Sep 12 14:18:18 <Fersure>	the ones I had included -udev lol
Sep 12 14:18:21 <Fersure>	oops
Sep 12 14:18:25 <Fersure>	no static dev rn pls
Sep 12 14:18:41 <wokko>	Sur3: have a look at the date 2005 :)
Sep 12 14:18:53 <Sur3>	neat
Sep 12 14:19:33 <Sur3>	well at least my default exclude list is longer.. ^^
Sep 12 14:19:47 <Fersure>	lol
Sep 12 14:19:54 <wokko>	wow I've been going with gentoo for 14 yrs, gone quick :)
Sep 12 14:20:03 <Fersure>	nice one!
Sep 12 14:20:27 <Fersure>	 I think I already have the most important part of my make.conf sorted: ACCEPT_LICENSE="-* @FREE" =]
Sep 12 14:21:16 <wokko>	I think that is default nowadays too
Sep 12 14:21:41 <Sur3>	i'm on gentoo since my first chaos congress is think that was 22c3 in 2005 ^^
Sep 12 14:22:04 <iamben>	yes that is the default license setting since may of this year
Sep 12 14:22:37 <wokko>	 2019-05-23  Change of ACCEPT_LICENSE default ah iamben bet me :)
Sep 12 14:24:34 <Sur3>	I first tried suse and debian first but they had problems with my soundcard and 2.4/2.6 kernels, and on that chaos congress i asked someone in front of me with a cool looking desktop with many open shells what linux he uses and he said gentoo, then I followed the handbook and everyhing worked out of the box.. ^^
Sep 12 14:26:09 <Sur3>	ohh wait u can just set @FREE globally? i put every package with licenses into package.license... o.O
Sep 12 14:26:42 <iamben>	what were you setting global ACCEPT_LICENSE to?
Sep 12 14:26:52 <iamben>	just "-*" only?
Sep 12 14:27:19 <Sur3>	didnt set it
Sep 12 14:27:28 <iamben>	then it has always been some superset of @FREE
Sep 12 14:28:14 <Sur3>	what was this command again to let emerge pront those variables?
Sep 12 14:28:20 <Sur3>	*print
Sep 12 14:28:29 <iamben>	emerge --info shows it, or portageq envvar ACCEPT_LICENSE
Sep 12 14:29:02 <Sur3>	yep its only @FREE
Sep 12 14:29:30 <iamben>	default used to be "* -@EULA" so the only package.license additions you needed were for installing things in @EULA group.  now it's "-* @FREE" so you need package.license entries for anythign NOT in @FREE group
Sep 12 14:30:16 <wokko>	basically only linux-firmware license here
Sep 12 14:30:30 <Sur3>	should i update from 17.0 to 17.1 profile?
Sep 12 14:30:46 <iamben>	Sur3: at some point yes, as the 17.0 profiles will be deprecated & removed
Sep 12 14:30:53 <Sur3>	oh ok
Sep 12 14:31:10 <Sur3>	this update task looks so complicated
Sep 12 14:31:12 <iamben>	same as 13.0 and 10.0 and 2008.0 before
Sep 12 14:31:58 <wokko>	Sur3: its quite easy if you just do step by step
Sep 12 14:32:06 <Sur3>	ok

Sep 12 15:04:06 <cilly>	Just me or are the following two gentoo sides empty: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Tools and https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Bootloader
Sep 12 15:04:52 <cilly>	I tried already different browsers and disabled all ad-blocking & proxies, but no avail.
Sep 12 15:05:09 <iamben>	server problems
Sep 12 15:05:30 <cilly>	oki, thx
Sep 12 15:06:55 <cilly>	I am looking for a solution to connect a serial console to my Intel NUC which runs headless, including BIOS access. Has anyone done this yet? Any suggestions?
Sep 12 15:07:33 <grawity>	if you need BIOS access, it needs to be a BIOS feature
Sep 12 15:07:46 <grawity>	on PCs you might be able to get serial-over-LAN using AMT/vPro
Sep 12 15:07:57 <cilly>	well, there is the intel AMT built in, will this help?
Sep 12 15:11:39 <iamben>	i dont think we have open source tools to work with the AMT remote console
Sep 12 15:12:03 <grawity>	dev-util/amtterm?
Sep 12 15:12:19 <cilly>	But can I view console then?
Sep 12 15:12:39 <grawity>	that's kinda the point, although I'm not entirely sure if it shows you serial console or the main text-mode display
Sep 12 15:12:53 <grawity>	I've never really used AMT though, just HP/Dell server IPMI stuff
Sep 12 15:14:00 <cilly>	I know, you can access BIOS thru AMT and also perform restarts, or select the boot media.
Sep 12 15:16:19 <cilly>	Or is it possible to write a kernel crash dump onto a non violatable device?
Sep 12 15:16:56 <cilly>	I really loved my old G5 which has the crash dumps stored in NVRAM.
Sep 12 15:17:37 <Kelsar>	cilly: yes, you can, if your system has nvram for it
Sep 12 15:17:47 <zxcat>	hi all. Is possible to compile firefox without Rust ?
Sep 12 15:17:59 <iamben>	zxcat: not anymore, no
Sep 12 15:18:14 <cilly>	Kelsar: well, I doubt the Intel NUC hardware has NVRAM
Sep 12 15:18:32 <Kelsar>	cilly: dunno, solder some on it ;)
Sep 12 15:18:45 <cilly>	Kelsar: yeah, nice joke
Sep 12 15:19:09 <grawity>	isn't there a thing called crashkernel which can write the dumps anywhere you need?
Sep 12 15:19:29 <Kelsar>	cilly: also there are remote kernel crashdumps
Sep 12 15:19:51 <cilly>	Kelsar: remote kernel crashdumps, over netconsole?
Sep 12 15:20:00 <grawity>	also, "non-volatile"
Sep 12 15:20:15 <Kelsar>	cilly: even per ssh
Sep 12 15:23:04 <cilly>	well, the problem might be, the crash is cause of the network stack, so networking won't be accessible reliably.
Sep 12 15:32:07 <iamben>	that amtterm tool is new to me, i might try it out on a machine over here
Sep 12 15:33:04 <petaflot>	hello! I have a (hopfuly)  small issue: dev-python/pyblake2             PYTHON_TARGETS: python3_5
Sep 12 15:33:19 <petaflot>	but: emerge: there are no ebuilds to satisfy "dev-python/pyblake2[python_targets_pypy(-)?,-python_single_target_pypy(-),python_targets_python2_7(-)?,-python_single_target_python2_7(-),python_targets_python3_5(-)?,-python_single_target_python3_5(-)]".
Sep 12 15:33:33 <petaflot>	I don't quite get it..
Sep 12 15:33:57 <iamben>	petaflot: please share the full emerge output via wetpaste
Sep 12 15:34:08 <iamben>	and wgetpaste
Sep 12 15:36:49 <petaflot>	http://dpaste.com/17RHYRR
Sep 12 15:38:11 <iamben>	petaflot: can you also share output of "emerge -pvO dev-python/requests dev-python/chardet" ? i want to compare their python settings
Sep 12 15:38:37 <petaflot>	strange. now it complains on chardet, which has also an explicit python target specified
Sep 12 15:39:21 <petaflot>	http://dpaste.com/2928FJ0
Sep 12 15:39:44 <iamben>	you're enabling pypy on requests?
Sep 12 15:40:00 <iamben>	why
Sep 12 15:40:16 <petaflot>	this night help too: http://dpaste.com/0FJEKNY
Sep 12 15:40:39 <petaflot>	iamben: no particular reason I suppose. I just noticed and I find it strange
Sep 12 15:40:41 <iamben>	why are you enabling pypy? do you actually need it?
Sep 12 15:41:14 <iamben>	it's stable-masked so not availbale unless you unmask the flag
Sep 12 15:41:27 <petaflot>	iamben: I've had the need for it, not sure if it is still the case though
Sep 12 15:41:42 <iamben>	and autounmask cannot help with this, so it chokes when you unmask & enable pypy support on one package, but not on that package's deps
Sep 12 15:41:55 <iamben>	why do you need python3_5 & python3_7? are yu a python developer?
Sep 12 15:43:15 <petaflot>	iamben: yes
Sep 12 15:43:51 <iamben>	some of those targets are stable-masked, so enabling them requires some advanced setup (if you're on stable)
Sep 12 15:43:57 <petaflot>	I just removed pypy on the requests package.. sync and stuff in progress
Sep 12 15:44:19 <iamben>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Python/PYTHON_TARGETS
Sep 12 15:45:00 <iamben>	see the "unmasking non-stable impl..." section for details on this.  this will apply to any stable-masked flag or target.. which currently includes python3_7, pypy, pypy3
Sep 12 15:46:47 <petaflot>	iamben: yes I had some trouble to get that working. then some time later I had some mean package blocks involving eudev and systemd, removed quite a number of system packages and I am now trying to finishe the upgrade
Sep 12 15:56:42 <iamben>	do you still have problems now?
Sep 12 15:59:14 <petaflot>	iamben: something with different qt versions being pulled in the same slot... that should be doable
Sep 12 16:00:35 <iamben>	those may be false positives... unless you are mixing some stable/unstable qt parts
Sep 12 16:03:38 <petaflot>	iamben: yes, I have no special requirements on qt, I am just removing these packages now
Sep 12 16:04:27 <iamben>	share the output if you're not sure, very often those 'multiple versions in one slot' conflicts are red herrings and there's a more urgent problem elsewhere in the output
Sep 12 16:11:10 <petaflot>	I am totally unsure at the moment.. just waiting for the output
Sep 12 16:13:29 <petaflot>	depency calculations are horribly long :-/
Sep 12 16:15:36 <petaflot>	meh. I forgot to 2>&1
Sep 12 16:16:39 <grknight>	you'll never forget if you use wgetpaste -c
Sep 12 16:17:19 <petaflot>	iamben: http://dpaste.com/16ANE3A
Sep 12 16:20:34 <iamben>	petaflot: im curious what your package.accept_keywords entries for qt look like, maybe share "grep -r dev-qt/ /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords"
Sep 12 16:21:32 <iamben>	at first glance it looks like your entry for dev-qt/designer may be restricted to 5.12.4 only, but it could be some other things
Sep 12 16:21:54 <petaflot>	I am playing with the backtrack options. sure: http://dpaste.com/1WCEPC1
Sep 12 16:22:29 <iamben>	yeah as i suspected
Sep 12 16:22:56 <iamben>	1) you probably should be using stable qt unless you have a good reason  2) if you allow unstable, you need to be more thorough, possibly with a wildcard entry
Sep 12 16:23:43 <petaflot>	if I remember well, I had to go through this because of qt with python 3.7
Sep 12 16:24:06 <iamben>	maybe you shouldn't have enabled 3.7 globally, but only on packages where you need it
Sep 12 16:24:16 <iamben>	were you specifically doing development for PyQt5 on python 3.7?
Sep 12 16:24:26 <petaflot>	yep :-/
Sep 12 16:24:35 <iamben>	maybe you should be on full unstable
Sep 12 16:25:51 <iamben>	anyway you have MOST of the qt collection allowing unstable >=5.11.0 then a handful allowing only =5.12.4, this is a problem now that 5.12.5 is latest unstable
Sep 12 16:27:12 <petaflot>	iamben: I replaced all 5.12.4 by 5.12.5
Sep 12 16:27:27 <iamben>	that will be a problem again when the next version is out
Sep 12 16:27:58 <petaflot>	do you suggest I should accept >=5.12 for all?
Sep 12 16:28:20 <iamben>	that's mostly meaningless, you may as well use unversioned entries if you're going that route
Sep 12 16:28:42 <petaflot>	that makes sense
Sep 12 16:28:43 <iamben>	you could replace them all with a single entry "dev-qt/*" to allow any unstable ever
Sep 12 16:29:08 <iamben>	or you could use "dev-qt/*:5/5.12" to allow all 5.12 versions but not allow unstable 5.13 or 5.14 when they hit
Sep 12 16:29:12 <petaflot>	oh, I didn't know I could use wildcards on the packages
Sep 12 16:29:27 <iamben>	wildcard usage is limited but it can be used for this particular case
Sep 12 16:29:32 <petaflot>	:-)
Sep 12 16:30:14 <iamben>	eg you can't mix wildcards with version (dev-qt/*-5.12.5 is invalid) but you can use it with slots
Sep 12 16:32:56 <petaflot>	I am still quite unfamiliar with slots and how they work
Sep 12 16:33:42 <iamben>	you can check (eg) "eshowkw qtcore" output to see what versions are available and which ones are stable/unstable and which ones are in what slot
Sep 12 16:34:08 <petaflot>	so if I understand well, "dev-qt/*:5/5.12" means for all packages in dev-qt/ for the "version 5 slot" accept all 5.12 versions?
Sep 12 16:34:20 <iamben>	the slot is literally 5/5.12
Sep 12 16:34:31 <iamben>	5.11 versioned were in 5/5.11 slot
Sep 12 16:35:02 <iamben>	this is specific to how qt does its slots, most other packages won't work this way.  but that's why you shoudl use eshowkw to see what the slots look like.
Sep 12 16:36:21 <petaflot>	this is nice :-) however I'm not quite sure how to make sense of the eapi/unused/slot columns
Sep 12 16:36:58 <iamben>	that's fine, i don't see any reason to worry about eapi & unused in this current discussion =)
Sep 12 16:38:13 <josef64>	dev-qt/qtsql has a different subslot
Sep 12 16:38:46 <iamben>	hmm that throws a wrench into our spokes
Sep 12 16:38:51 <iamben>	well, just need one extra entry
Sep 12 16:39:00 <josef64>	yes :)
Sep 12 16:41:58 <wozencroft>	Oh, if you want to use openrc without bash - is it even possible? openrc seems to depend on bash
Sep 12 16:42:24 <wozencroft>	It looks also portage
Sep 12 16:42:26 <newbieG>	Offtopic but don't know better place then this ..... I am planning to upgrade RAM I already have 4GB on One Slot .... Should I go for 4GB or 8GB(price are almost same)
Sep 12 16:42:52 <iamben>	newbieG: #gentoo-chat
Sep 12 16:43:08 <BtbN>	You want to be running an even amount of sticks, for Dual Channel to work. Not sure if they need to be the same size for that.
Sep 12 16:43:17 <iamben>	wozencroft: there's a bash USE flag that toggles the bash dep.
Sep 12 16:43:48 <BtbN>	Can you even run portage without bash? Pretty sure ebuilds are guranteed to be run with bash.
Sep 12 16:43:52 <iamben>	wozencroft: im not sure what you mean by "it looks also portage"
Sep 12 16:44:10 <iamben>	portage absolutely does need bash
Sep 12 16:44:51 <wozencroft>	iamben: Yes, that's what I mean, just checked the dependencies (also perl-cleaner and xmlto)
Sep 12 16:45:20 <newbieG>	iamben: How to check CAS latency?
Sep 12 16:45:38 <iamben>	you can build an embedded-type (non-updating, no toolchain/PM) without bash, but you cannot really have a living breathing gentoo without bash
Sep 12 16:45:42 <iamben>	newbieG: #gentoo-chat
Sep 12 16:46:31 <wozencroft>	iamben: Yes, thank you, that's what I was curious about, if anyone maybe managed to configure bash-less gentoo
Sep 12 16:47:02 <wozencroft>	In a way that bash is not existent on the system - but it looks it is basically... Using an other shell is a different question
Sep 12 16:47:25 <iamben>	wozencroft: you know you can just set your user shell to something not-bash, right? =)
Sep 12 16:48:21 <wozencroft>	iamben: Yes, that's what I'm doing, would have loved to remove bash completely, which is not a good (working) idea then :)
Sep 12 16:50:50 <depe28>	hi all, I have this error when compiling android 10: .path_interposer: no python-exec wrapped executable found in /usr/lib/python-exec. On google i saw this error has only been experienced by gentoo users. You know how to fix it?
Sep 12 16:52:33 <username234>	depe28: I assume you used emerge to install?
Sep 12 16:52:43 <depe28>	yes
Sep 12 16:53:10 <depe28>	eselect says i have both python 2.7 and 3.6
Sep 12 16:53:13 <jerware>	hello.
Sep 12 16:53:18 <josef64>	wozencroft: yes, please be careful, unmerge bash will break your gentoo horribly
Sep 12 16:53:29 <wozencroft>	Yes, just checked, wiki also says bash should NOT be uninstalled. It's interesting though as e.g. zsh has bash compatibility.
Sep 12 16:53:32 <jerware>	Is ntpd also used on the client side to keep synced with time servers?  Or is ntpd soley a server?
Sep 12 16:53:49 <username234>	jerware: it can be used for both
Sep 12 16:53:59 <jerware>	ok thanks.
Sep 12 16:54:33 <jerware>	if you accidentally unmerged bash, you can just boot up the live cd, and chroot to that partition to re emerge bash. correct?
Sep 12 16:54:38 <wozencroft>	josef64: So figuring out a way to make openrc and portage working with zsh would make bash not required enymore
Sep 12 16:54:41 <wozencroft>	*anymore
Sep 12 16:55:11 <jerware>	wait no, you can't chroot with out bash at the destination partition
Sep 12 16:55:34 <iamben>	jerware: you can chroot with another shell, but you cannot emerge without bash
Sep 12 16:55:34 <wozencroft>	jerware: Can't you chroot with an other shell?
Sep 12 16:55:48 <iamben>	openrc doesn't require bash.
Sep 12 16:55:52 <jerware>	oh right,  what other shells would be available?
Sep 12 16:55:59 <grknight>	depe28: sounds like something broke Gentoo's integration of multiple python preferences for the executable you are running.  you will need to find what did it
Sep 12 16:56:03 <iamben>	it does require a posix-compliant shell though, which zsh isnt
Sep 12 16:56:12 <iamben>	jerware: busybox sh, at least
Sep 12 16:56:30 <depe28>	grknight: I didn't do anything :/
Sep 12 16:56:38 <jerware>	I guess you can copy the bash binary from the stage 3 right?
Sep 12 16:56:54 <grknight>	depe28: you or something running did
Sep 12 16:56:55 <depe28>	im installing 3.5 as well, just to see if it solves the problem
Sep 12 16:57:12 <iamben>	jerware: you'd probably need to unpack a rescue binpkg of bash by hand
Sep 12 16:57:37 <grknight>	depe28: wrong end of the horse.  python is not to blame.  the app symlinks to python-exec, but python-exec cannot find the correct copy where it expects
Sep 12 16:58:02 <depe28>	grknight: i noticed that when i got the error there were 2gb free, but then I deleted 50gb of old android sources and i still get that
Sep 12 16:58:17 <grknight>	on what? what executable?
Sep 12 16:58:41 <depe28>	what?
Sep 12 16:58:49 <grknight>	what are you running to trigger that?
Sep 12 16:59:11 <depe28>	im building android
Sep 12 16:59:32 <grknight>	that doesn't mean very much
Sep 12 16:59:55 <depe28>	but on google i found that people got the same by running the command "idle". that triggers the error for me as well
Sep 12 17:00:49 <depe28>	btw on /usr/lib/python-exec i have python-exec2  python2.7  python3.6
Sep 12 17:00:59 <grknight>	depe28: what exists in /usr/lib/python-exec/python2.7 ? should be a bunch of scripts
Sep 12 17:01:17 <grknight>	and also symlinks to valid python versions
Sep 12 17:01:35 <depe28>	yes i have a buncch of scripts
Sep 12 17:02:07 <grknight>	so does  idle exist as a symlink to ../../../bin/idle2.7 ?
Sep 12 17:02:19 <freakynl>	Hey, I have some issues with Intel GPU's and need to build their drm-tip branch. I succeeded in that, but was quite amazed the modules directory it installed is almost 5GB in size. Apparently it doesn't strip the modules by default where it does seem to do that on my regular gentoo-sources. Is there some option in the config I'm missing (I know you can install them with an option that will strip them as
Sep 12 17:02:25 <freakynl>	well, but this kind of makes the source/build directory rather large as well and build time for my own kernel (which does have much less enabled) is ~10 minutes vs almost 3 hours on this one - rather have it build w/o debug symbols to begin with)
Sep 12 17:03:13 <jerware>	I have a hard drive with an other distro of Linux,  how can I add that to grub.conf?  Is that still edited by hand?
Sep 12 17:03:18 <iamben>	freakynl: did you enable CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO ?
Sep 12 17:03:29 <iamben>	jerware: if you install os-prober, grub-mkconfig can usually find other distros on other disks
Sep 12 17:03:35 <depe28>	in /usr/lib/python-exec/ there's no file called "idle"
Sep 12 17:03:41 <jerware>	ok thanks
Sep 12 17:04:02 <grknight>	depe28: not under /usr/lib/python-exec/python2.7?
Sep 12 17:04:05 <jerware>	iamben:  including freebsd ?
Sep 12 17:04:07 *	ChanServ gives voice to candrews
Sep 12 17:04:19 <iamben>	jerware: afaik yes, i don't have firsthand experience with that
Sep 12 17:04:48 <depe28>	grknight: yeah, nowhere, /usr/lib/python-exec/python2.7 included
Sep 12 17:05:39 <depe28>	it's a symlynk: /usr/bin/idle -> ../lib/python-exec/python-exec2
Sep 12 17:05:59 <grknight>	depe28: well something nuked those symlinks to idle, python, pydoc, python-config.  rebuilding python:2.7 and python:3.6 will put it back, but I wonder what's the real cause
Sep 12 17:06:32 <grknight>	python-exec2 is a wrapper to call the correct script by preference and current environment
Sep 12 17:06:50 <depe28>	aww, maybe it was the recent update i did
Sep 12 17:06:56 <grknight>	the real scripts are in python-exec/pythonx.x
Sep 12 17:07:13 <freakynl>	iamben: grep doesn't find a DEBUG_INFO in .config at all, there is however quite a few with debug in them: https://pastebin.com/eB5inCUS
Sep 12 17:08:04 <depe28>	ahh, understood, so it doesn't find them, right?
Sep 12 17:08:51 <grknight>	apparently
Sep 12 17:08:56 *	ChanServ gives voice to maffblaster
Sep 12 17:09:29 <iamben>	freakynl: afaik it's only DEBUG_INFO which adds the large debug info to modules
Sep 12 17:09:35 <depe28>	hmm, hope that rebuilding will fix that
Sep 12 17:09:41 <iamben>	the rest of those options just enable some runtime debug output
Sep 12 17:12:37 <depe28>	grknight: i rebuilt python:2.7 and 3.6 but i still have that error
Sep 12 17:13:03 <grknight>	depe28: those symlinks now exist?
Sep 12 17:14:07 <depe28>	nope, idle is not found in /usr/lib/python-exec/ (subdirs included)
Sep 12 17:14:12 <wozencroft>	I have gentoo base, without X, it takes 190 MB RAM. Nice. Lowest for me was 130 MB for puppy

Sep 12 17:17:02 *	ChanServ gives voice to Zorry
Sep 12 17:17:08 <depe28>	nop, same with android
Sep 12 17:17:20 <depe28>	so i enable tk use?
Sep 12 17:17:22 <grknight>	it all comes down to what command "rebuild andriod" is actually running to help fix it
Sep 12 17:17:46 <grknight>	strace it if necessary
Sep 12 17:18:31 <depe28>	that's what i get https://bpaste.net/show/14fJ
Sep 12 17:19:50 <depe28>	however if i run the command in the paste it works, so, that's not the command im lookin for
Sep 12 17:21:58 <freakynl>	The real issue might be quite a bit higher up in the output especially if you build threaded (-j)
Sep 12 17:23:31 <depe28>	i don't think so
Sep 12 17:25:59 <depe28>	with tk idle command works but on android i still get that error, so, it might be something specific
Sep 12 17:27:51 <AlaricToo>	Hey folks ....   kexec question.  kexec hasn't been working right in a while and I think it's because I shot myself in the foot.  Should kexec read (a) /etc/conf.d/kexec, (b) /etc/kexec.conf, (c) both?  And if 'both' and they conflict, which takes priority?
Sep 12 17:28:53 <grknight>	i've never had kexec work the way I wanted (to upgrade a kernel to new version)  it always seems to load the old file no matter what
Sep 12 17:29:29 <AlaricToo>	I'm working on the assumption that it's /etc/conf.d/kexec and that /etc/kexec.conf is bogus, but the Gentoo how-to is 14 years old.
Sep 12 17:44:55 <AlaricToo>	LOOKS to me like /etc/kexec.conf is unnecessary but overrides /etc/conf.d/kexec if present
Sep 12 17:49:55 <AlaricToo>	even so, it just doesn't appear to be working at all, reboot still does a cold boot
Sep 12 17:51:26 <Kelsar>	grknight: my personal server is only kexeced instead of reboot
Sep 12 17:52:23 <BtbN>	And how do you apply the numerous microcode updates?
Sep 12 17:52:33 <grknight>	Kelsar: like i said, i've never been able to get my servers in openrc to kexec to a different file.  it will kexec.. but to the old kernel/initramfs
Sep 12 17:52:51 <KuroLevin>	wozencroft: 190MB sounds like a lot for a base gentoo, I usually get <100MB
Sep 12 17:53:19 <BtbN>	I always just manually kexec -l the kernel + initrd, and then do systemctl kexec. Does openrc not have anything like that, where it just reboot, but useses kexec -e instead?
Sep 12 17:53:22 <Kelsar>	BtbN: AMD has not that much
Sep 12 17:53:28 <Kelsar>	BtbN: especially for phenom
Sep 12 17:53:41 <Kelsar>	BtbN: exact how i do it
Sep 12 17:54:03 <grknight>	BtbN: openrc-init now has a -k option but I've only previously attempted with sysvinit as pid 1
Sep 12 17:54:21 <BtbN>	lately systemd has become a bit too smart, and only does kexec when you are using systemd-boot, but you can trivially patch it to behave again.
Sep 12 17:54:28 <AlaricToo>	trying a manual kexec on one of my boxes right now ...   doesn't seem to be going well
Sep 12 17:55:54 <grknight>	AlaricToo: if you want to try to setup openrc-init instead of sysvinit.  perhaps that might solve the issue.  then you can 'openrc-shutdown -k now'
Sep 12 17:56:14 <AlaricToo>	looks like it did reload, but didn't actually restart X
Sep 12 17:56:28 <AlaricToo>	oh, I'm using openrc
Sep 12 17:56:30 <Kelsar>	BtbN: no, still works for me somehow
Sep 12 17:56:51 <grknight>	great part is.. you just have to change init= and enable a couple ttys to test openrc-init.. easy to switch back
Sep 12 17:56:52 <AlaricToo>	I won't touch systemd with a twenty-foot pole unless it has a cattle prod strapped to the end
Sep 12 17:58:02 <AlaricToo>	huh.  narn:root:~:1 # openrc-shutdown -k now
Sep 12 17:58:02 <AlaricToo>	openrc-shutdown: invalid option -- 'k'
Sep 12 17:58:46 <AlaricToo>	(sys-apps/openrc-0.41.2)
Sep 12 17:59:08 <AlaricToo>	does it need 0.42.1?
Sep 12 17:59:52 <juli>	hi is there any way to restrict the portage ram usage? i hve 8GB ram but when i compile sci-libs/pcl with MAKEOPTS="-j3" instead of -j8 it seems still to consume 99% of ram ...
Sep 12 18:00:06 <juli>	and because of that i can't work while compiling
Sep 12 18:00:18 <iamben>	juli: you cannot tweak ram usage from "the outside"
Sep 12 18:00:31 <iamben>	not like you can limit cpu time
Sep 12 18:00:51 <Kelsar>	juli: with c++ you need to calculate 2G per compile job and then there is what you need for other stuff too.
Sep 12 18:01:00 <Kelsar>	juli: and hopefully you are not using a tmpfs
Sep 12 18:01:14 <iamben>	so if you want the pcl compilation to need less ram, you need to change how you execute that compilation
Sep 12 18:02:22 <grknight>	AlaricToo: did you boot with init=/sbin/openrc-init ?
Sep 12 18:03:17 <grknight>	'ps 1' should report openrc-init instead of 'init [3]'
Sep 12 18:03:51 <wozencroft>	KuroLevin: Oh, that's considerably less... Not sure why it's higher here though. Have Xorg installed, but not started. Also zfs and qemu. Otherwise no services or DE, etc. taking ram.
Sep 12 18:04:02 <AlaricToo>	Hmm.  No.  It's still init.  OK, where do I correct that?
Sep 12 18:04:27 <iamben>	wozencroft: there's a tool ps_mem which can help identify the cuprits
Sep 12 18:04:58 <wozencroft>	iamben: Oh, thank you for the hint
Sep 12 18:05:02 <iamben>	you have qemu running, as part of your minimal baseline?
Sep 12 18:05:12 <juli>	so what should i do? run it with -j1?
Sep 12 18:05:23 <wozencroft>	iamben: Nope, just configured in case I need it
Sep 12 18:05:23 <iamben>	juli: or get more ram
Sep 12 18:05:53 <KuroLevin>	wozencroft: never used zfs, so it could be the reason.
Sep 12 18:07:06 <KuroLevin>	juli: maybe try zram, I never tried it personally but have heard it's quite effecive
Sep 12 18:07:13 <AlaricToo>	ah, right, grub command line
Sep 12 18:09:00 <KuroLevin>	s/effecive/effective
Sep 12 18:11:24 <juli>	what is zram? something like swap?
Sep 12 18:12:41 <KuroLevin>	juli: zram reserves a portion of your ram for compressed swap
Sep 12 18:13:18 <KuroLevin>	you can check the wiki:https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Zram
Sep 12 18:13:23 <AlaricToo>	Oh, it's not -k, it's -K
Sep 12 18:14:20 <juli>	seems to be quite interessting :) i'll read it.
Sep 12 18:15:12 <AlaricToo>	and ....   that doesn't look like it worked
Sep 12 18:15:32 <AlaricToo>	the machine is just hung
Sep 12 18:16:20 <AlaricToo>	pings, but no services are running

Sep 12 18:56:19 <ishaim>	Q: there's so many things i don't want to compile on this netbook that not even distcc seems to address (i'm using it, it's not helping). can i pick your guys' brains? even to just pull -bin versions of like firefox which is the obv decision considering the circumstances, firefox-bin, libreoffice-bin, pull in annoyingly large things that must be compiled locally. should i expect a "upstream/package-related
Sep 12 18:56:25 <ishaim>	problem" answer? my educated guess is that it's each and every individual packages fault, but want a second opinion on that...
Sep 12 19:03:12 <iamben>	ishaim: have you considered getting more memory?
Sep 12 19:04:06 <iamben>	another option is a binhost if you have a stronger gentoo (or other linux) box
Sep 12 19:07:22 <ishaim>	iamben: watching top during the compilations constantly and tbh it's the cores (only 2) not the memory. i've got a stronger gentoo, i'll look into binhost, ty
Sep 12 19:07:48 <iamben>	oh i thought you were saying that the compilations were actually failing
Sep 12 19:08:15 <javashin>	hello
Sep 12 19:08:22 <iamben>	a chroot-binhost is my favorite way to deal with a slow notebook
Sep 12 19:09:30 <iamben>	so you spend (eg) 2 hours on the binhost --buildpkg + 2 minutes on the laptop --usepkg, versus 12 hours building directly on laptop
Sep 12 19:10:07 <ishaim>	iamben: it seems a lot of packages need to compile locally, must be built in certain ways, that in any case mostly just don't even use distcc even when available
Sep 12 19:10:28 <ishaim>	iamben: yes this is exactly what i'm looking for
Sep 12 19:10:33 <javashin>	by any chance someone know this ?> i was on top of root {/} and i ran by mistake rm -rf * and when i notice what i was doing as root i aborted the command with ctrl+c , my question is anyone know what dir rm starts removing ? does it start with bin or boot ?
Sep 12 19:11:26 <javashin>	or a dir that starts with CAPs like BIN-BAK ?
Sep 12 19:12:10 <iamben>	javashin: * is expanded by bash, not rm
Sep 12 19:12:33 <AlaricToo>	still getting nowhere with kexec.  all that happens when I try to kexec is the machine hangs and never comes back.
Sep 12 19:12:57 <javashin>	i think it erased some big files i have in /BIGSiZEDIRS
Sep 12 19:13:00 <ishaim>	iamben: is there some sort of unified wiki/faq for this approach? should i just start with looking up "binhost" and go from there?
Sep 12 19:13:10 <AlaricToo>	I may as well just disable it.  My machines seldom get rebooted anyway.
Sep 12 19:13:17 <javashin>	i think the system is safe
Sep 12 19:13:20 <javashin>	i dont know
Sep 12 19:13:22 <javashin>	...
Sep 12 19:13:26 <iamben>	ishaim: maybe this: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide
Sep 12 19:13:46 <iamben>	javashin: eg do "cd / && echo *"
Sep 12 19:13:55 <ishaim>	iamben: i'll start there, tyvm
Sep 12 19:14:33 <dgurney>	javashin: depends on how quickly you terminated the rm execution
Sep 12 19:14:48 <javashin>	was fast
Sep 12 19:14:52 <javashin>	but is ok
Sep 12 19:15:07 <javashin>	nothing that i really need was erased
Sep 12 19:15:08 <javashin>	thanks
Sep 12 19:15:27 <dgurney>	javashin: next time be very careful with wildcards
Sep 12 19:15:40 <javashin>	yeah the echo shows BIGSiZEDIRS
Sep 12 19:15:47 <javashin>	as the first in the list
Sep 12 19:15:50 <javashin>	ufff
Sep 12 19:16:06 <javashin>	i was scared
Sep 12 19:16:10 <javashin>	a bit
Sep 12 19:16:47 <dgurney>	javashin: I once run rm -rf * in my home directory, and the only thing that saved me was a recent snapshot
Sep 12 19:16:51 <ishaim>	i imagine there are instances in which typing 'rm -rf *' accidentally under those 'right' circumstances may happen. i just have no idea what in god's name that situation would look like.
Sep 12 19:17:18 <dgurney>	after that scare I always triple-check the directory I'm in before doing any wildcard operations
Sep 12 19:19:09 <jerichowasahoax>	zsh will ask for confirmation for dangerous globbed commands like that
Sep 12 19:19:45 <javashin>	dgurney, yes is time to start making zfs snapshots
Sep 12 19:21:30 <javashin>	if something is in the emerge --depclean list its never get pick up by emerge --update --deep --newuse --with-bdeps=y @world ?
Sep 12 19:24:35 <ishaim>	javashin: unfortunately --with-bdeps is the only part of the question i can't answer. i do emerge -avtNDu @world && emerge -a --depclean. why you are using --with-bdeps=y may provide some insight as to what you wish to accomplish, though i may not be able to answer your question directly
Sep 12 19:25:30 <jerichowasahoax>	ishaim: --with-bdeps=y was recommended before each depclean in the past. i understand it's not quite as important now, but you know how old habits are
Sep 12 19:25:34 <ishaim>	javashin: if something is in the 'world' set, --depclean doesn't remove it because it's *explicitly* installed, most likely by the user
Sep 12 19:26:45 <ishaim>	jerichowasahoax: in the past 10 years i've been using Gentoo, i've gotten away with being fine not using --with-bdeps. it always seemed to be some sort of exception to the rule to me
Sep 12 19:27:21 <ishaim>	jerichowasahoax: do you know *why* that was the recommendation?
Sep 12 19:28:42 <jerichowasahoax>	ishaim: not offhand, possibly some obscure dependency miscalculation?
Sep 12 19:29:17 <flippingBits>	To move overlays added with layman to repos.conf, can I just add them with eselect, and then delete them with layman?
Sep 12 19:31:30 <grknight>	flippingBits: just ensure their sync types are set to git (or whatever) and stop using layman and/or laymansync type
Sep 12 19:32:01 <grknight>	and rename the file later to be absolutely sure
Sep 12 19:33:07 <flippingBits>	yep, moving around to stop using layman, thanks
Sep 12 19:33:45 <grknight>	all eselect-repo does is writes the config.  adjusting it by hand should let portage sync it directly
Sep 12 19:34:09 <ishaim>	iamben: i think i'm stuck in the middle of the netbook compiling distcc. the irony. it's as if you need a binhost just to get distcc onto the weakest link (netbook). is this exactly what you do? or do you not even bother including the netbook into the distcc pool?
Sep 12 19:38:53 <adip>	what happens when I load old config into make nconfig? does it run make oldconfig with yes to all answers?
Sep 12 19:39:03 <ishaim>	Q: i am not in an xsession, using framebuffer and not xorg, haven't run startx at all. how can i "grep" the "title" of what would otherwise be the title bar for a terminal in a window manager/desktop environment? this is useful because it says exactly which package portage is currently merging
Sep 12 19:39:48 <grawity>	you cannot
Sep 12 19:40:30 <grawity>	tmux or screen would be able to show this (though maybe not by default)
Sep 12 19:41:11 <grawity>	but in general, the title is set by printing a few escape sequences to stdout, so it depends on 1) the program outputting them, 2) the terminal recognizing them
Sep 12 19:41:14 <ishaim>	grawity: how, then, is it received by my window manager awesomewm? or am i mistaken and rxvt-unicode is that's actually providing it? it still seems portage is providing this information. it'll always show merging 1/3, 2/3, 3/3, and exactly which packages they are
Sep 12 19:41:24 <bitlord>	ishaim, portage-utils's qlop can show currently running, (before it was `qlop -c` now I think `qlop -r`)
Sep 12 19:41:26 <grawity>	most programs won't output them when $TERM says "linux" because they know it won't recognize that
Sep 12 19:41:48 <grawity>	and for programs which do, the Linux console indeed won't recognize that and will just show it as garbage amongst regular output
Sep 12 19:42:03 <grawity>	i.e. it'll quickly scroll away with the rest of your portage logs
Sep 12 19:42:46 <grawity>	so, from the PoV of awesomewm, it's just a generic X11 window title that rxvt-unicode sets
Sep 12 19:42:55 <grawity>	but the important part isn't rxvt->wm, it's app->rxvt
Sep 12 19:46:40 <grawity>	looks like recent kernels recognize the sequence and just quietly ignore it
Sep 12 19:47:33 <ishaim>	bitlord: that's perfect, ty
Sep 12 19:48:00 <ishaim>	grawity: qlop -c seems to get me what i need, anyhow
Sep 12 19:48:50 <bitlord>	ishaim, also for builds, I guess you could use EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS  `--quiet-build`, most of the time there is no need to see the text scrolling
Sep 12 19:49:06 <bitlord>	then you will see what's currently running on the same terminal where build is running
Sep 12 19:49:40 <ishaim>	iamben: it's llvm. my netbook is trying to compile that. a lot of packages seem to include this as part of their builds, and so emerge --sync && emerge -avtNDu @world usually, annoyingly, pulls in yet another llvm compilation for whatever package decides that's how it builds
Sep 12 19:49:43 <bitlord>	ishaim, you still have a build log, and if it fails it will print it (not sure if full, or just last xyz lines, but full build log is still available)
Sep 12 19:50:29 <ishaim>	bitlord: i've put up with all that scrolling for a decade straight because i've always found the "scrolling text" informative. i understand much better now how upstream/downstream works ^^
Sep 12 19:51:58 <ishaim>	iamben: if that chroot-binhost setup can compile llvm *for* my laptop, that'd be ideal. do you know if that's the case? that's what's really troubling the netbook
Sep 12 19:58:41 <Aminder>	During my gentoo installation, i was able to complete all the steps up to the end of the bootloader in the wiki. When I reboot, Im stuck with "error 1962: no operating system found"
Sep 12 20:00:23 <doc235>	http://dpaste.com/3506CXG help here please. don't know what it wants
Sep 12 20:02:31 <username234>	doc235: to fix the last error switch from vixie to crony
Sep 12 20:04:02 <username234>	doc235: and it looks like you have a few qt libraries that need to be downgraded or upgraded.  Check your /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords settings.
Sep 12 20:05:05 <doc235>	ok
Sep 12 20:07:30 <doc235>	username234, i ran emerge -ac vixie-cron and removed it. what do i emerge for crony?
Sep 12 20:08:06 <username234>	doc235: well first, you insist I spell it correctly :)
Sep 12 20:08:17 <username234>	doc235: then you run emerge chrony
Sep 12 20:08:26 <doc235>	ahh ok, ty :)
Sep 12 20:10:11 <doc235>	ok emerged chrony. now to look at the rest
Sep 12 20:12:14 <grknight>	doc235: i think you may want cronie and not chrony when replacing vixie-cron
Sep 12 20:12:32 <doc235>	ah, ok
Sep 12 20:12:34 <grknight>	though chrony is not bad in replacing ntpd ;)
Sep 12 20:21:18 <KuroLevin>	Aminder: you either failed to install de bootloader correctly or you need to change some config on the BIOS
Sep 12 20:22:04 <iamben>	ishaim: yes.
Sep 12 20:33:52 <flippingBits>	once I have moved my overlays and sync looks good, can I just delete /var/lib/layman?

Sep 13 07:16:28 <West201>	username234 yes, but I don't see my grub folder in there
Sep 13 07:16:55 <username234>	West201: I suspect it's not then.  what does /proc/self/mounts say?
Sep 13 07:17:14 <wraeth>	mint: Portage, the package manager, uses ebuilds which act as a description of how the system builds and installs the package. The ebuild describes things like how to call make or whichever build tooling is required. 'emerge' is the CLI interface to Portage. You run emerge, portage looks at the ebuild, the ebuild says "i need $these installed as dependencies, and then run $some_commands to build and install the package", and so it does that.
Sep 13 07:17:28 <wokko>	zigol: are you using genkernel?
Sep 13 07:18:39 <wokko>	West201: make sure you haven't installed the new kernel to the unmount /boot also
Sep 13 07:18:55 <wokko>	unmounted*
Sep 13 07:19:28 <West201>	@wokko that's def the issue. The date is from September 9th as the last date
Sep 13 07:19:43 <West201>	username234 this is the output from that file http://dpaste.com/3HNY5D4

Sep 13 07:21:34 <West201>	I'm just curious what else I missed here
Sep 13 07:22:17 <username234>	West201: umount /boot
Sep 13 07:22:43 <wokko>	West201: easy mistake todo but I would umount /boot and make sure it is clean then mount /boot and check to see if new kernel is there
Sep 13 07:26:45 <mint>	*lurks* (away from keyboard)
Sep 13 07:29:30 <zigol>	wokko: no sucess
Sep 13 07:29:30 <West201>	I apolgize for my questions, but when I run "mount /boot or /dev/sdc1" my boot folder goes empty, but when I run "umount /boot/" all the kernel images are there? Is this normal
Sep 13 07:29:41 <zigol>	 
Sep 13 07:30:06 <zigol>	wokko: yes genkernel
Sep 13 07:31:28 <zigol>	wokko: a curiouse point is that when i try to issue : startx i get this error: modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'i915': Exec format error
Sep 13 07:31:29 <tdr>	sounds like you put your kernel on the rootfs inside the directory named "boot" and didn't have it mounted when it did make install
Sep 13 07:32:40 <West201>	@tdr yes it seems that way
Sep 13 07:33:47 <username234>	zigol: sounds like you modified your kernel without rebuilding the modules.
Sep 13 07:34:33 <zigol>	i dont understand what your saying, my english is not the best username234
Sep 13 07:35:21 <username234>	zigol: you ran 'make menuconfig' then 'make' then 'make install' but did not run 'make modules_install' between 'make' and 'make install'
Sep 13 07:35:55 <West201>	Any other way to update my grub folder?
Sep 13 07:36:11 <wokko>	West201: If I was you I would cp old kernel to home dir and clean out /boot (umount bersion of it) then mount /boot and rerun grub-install/grub-mkconfig and then reinstall old + new kernel into it
Sep 13 07:36:52 <mint>	*is back*
Sep 13 07:36:52 <tdr>	just rename boot, make a new boot and mount it
Sep 13 07:37:04 <mint>	so if i understand this correctly....
Sep 13 07:37:31 <West201>	let me give it a try and i'll report back
Sep 13 07:37:47 <mint>	most Linux distros force the end-user onto an upgrade hamster-wheel, just like in the Windows World and in the Apple World, correct?
Sep 13 07:38:58 <mint>	what I mean by this is: You MUST have a very recent version of a given Distro, otherwise the PAckage MAnager will "spew out an error message" when you try to download something from a repository, crrect?
Sep 13 07:39:08 <mint>	*correct?
Sep 13 07:39:24 <zigol>	when i issue modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'i915': Exec format error , after a startx
Sep 13 07:39:36 <wokko>	zigol: sounds like you didn't do your kernel properly
Sep 13 07:39:42 <mint>	so there's no room for us "fire-and-forget" "Retro" guys? amirite?
Sep 13 07:39:42 <zigol>	yeh
Sep 13 07:39:46 <wraeth>	mint: Not exactly. You can continue using the same version of software as much as you like if you're prepared to accept the risks that entails, like using known-vulnerable versions of software. The problem in "linux world" is that, if you have a significantly out-of-date system, upgrading it can be difficult because jumping large versions can make dependency calculation difficult. This is a state often referred to as "dependency hell".
Sep 13 07:40:10 <wokko>	zigol: if you use genkernel? what command did you run?
Sep 13 07:40:23 <zigol>	genkernel --config-kernel=config all
Sep 13 07:40:32 <zigol>	ops
Sep 13 07:40:38 <zigol>	--kernel-config
Sep 13 07:40:54 <Kangie>	mint, why do you *want* to run an old, unpatched system?
Sep 13 07:41:17 <mint>	okay... I've researched about the term/concept "DEpendency Hell" before -- I even read the Wikipedia article on the subject. But I previously did not want to bring up that term on a linux chatroom, cuz i thought it might trigger defensive reasctions from linux-soldiers
Sep 13 07:41:19 <Kangie>	I can see no benefits to doing so outside of embedded-land.
Sep 13 07:41:30 <wokko>	zigol: so how did you enable drm_i915 then with that ?
Sep 13 07:41:33 <mint>	lol
Sep 13 07:41:56 <mint>	i dont WANT to.... its just temporary until i upgrade! lol
Sep 13 07:42:37 <Kangie>	right, but I fail to see the relevance of your question about forcing users onto an upgrade hamster wheel.
Sep 13 07:42:39 <tdr>	mint, #gentoo is for support with gentoo linux
Sep 13 07:42:41 <wraeth>	mint: We do have a clean-language policy in this channel, but that's what many people know dependency resolution issues as. Also, it's worth stressing that different distributions have different package managers that handle dependency specification and calculation differently.
Sep 13 07:42:43 <Kangie>	also that.
Sep 13 07:42:55 <earendil>	mint: probably better subject for #gentoo-chat
Sep 13 07:43:04 <mint>	i guess i REALLY need to "be on the ball" with the latest and greatest, even more than i previously imagined... i mean... my LiveDVDs aren't even that old... they're all from 2018.
Sep 13 07:44:01 <mint>	in fact, i still use WinXP (i never surf the web with it, for security reasons!)
Sep 13 07:44:03 <wraeth>	mint: If you're on the "stable" branch of Gentoo, a weekly update check would generally only pull in a few packages. How often you actually do that can vary based on a few factors.
Sep 13 07:44:42 <mint>	i JUST installed Gentoo from my SysRec LiveDVD. Im using Mint ATM, tho.
Sep 13 07:45:06 <mint>	you guys have answered all my questions.... thx
Sep 13 07:45:27 <mint>	bout to catch some zzz
Sep 13 07:45:47 <mint>	peace!
Sep 13 07:46:02 <wraeth>	mint: Good lcuk, then, when you start using Gentoo. If you have any further support questions, feel free to ask here; otherwise there's #gentoo-chat for off-topic talking. :)
Sep 13 07:46:14 <wokko>	zigol: I suggest to redo your kernel with 'genkernel --menuconfig --no-clean --kernel-config=<path to your .config> all' check to see if drm_i915 is enabled,
Sep 13 07:46:28 <mint>	will do, wraeth!
Sep 13 07:46:34 <mint>	*lurks*
Sep 13 08:25:04 <doc235>	http://dpaste.com/0WFERFG how do i fix this? please

Sep 15 22:41:22 <assemblyPL_>	i just copied over the resov.conf from sysrescuecd and ping works in chroot
Sep 15 22:41:51 <w1d3m0d3>	how can I allow for a windows computer to connect to ttyUSB0 on a linux host to do work on it over serial
Sep 15 22:42:06 <assemblyPL_>	dont get the geateway ect how am i supposed to find this out from handbook
Sep 15 22:42:16 <w1d3m0d3>	rn I run getty /dev/ttyUSB0 9600, but when I connect via putty it just fails
Sep 15 22:44:07 <Kelsar>	assemblyPL_: you don't need to yet, your sysrescucd takes car for network atm
Sep 15 22:44:44 <Kelsar>	assemblyPL_: and in your system you will likely use dhcp anyways, but that comes later
Sep 15 23:06:49 <assemblyPL_>	should i add mcpu to march native maybe?
Sep 15 23:07:36 <assemblyPL_>	like do some packages override the march native then it will be atleast mcpu or mtune?
Sep 15 23:09:26 *	ChanServ gives voice to maffblaster
Sep 15 23:10:31 <assemblyPL_>	can i use "-ftree-vectorize -ftree-slp-vectorize" on my old cpu? how to check?
Sep 15 23:11:59 <liqsquid>	gcc manual. optimization for x86 part.
Sep 15 23:12:18 <w1d3m0d3>	ok back here again, what's a reliable way to debug a kernel panic? I'm thinking having dmesg go over serial and using another PC would do but idk how
Sep 15 23:12:49 <w1d3m0d3>	its possible that it's not even a kernel panic but I still have hopes that it is because at least I'd know where to start (context: my kernel freezes time to time seemingly randomly)
Sep 15 23:12:55 <redsh>	The manpage says -ftree-slp-vectorize is enabled by -ftree-vectorize anyway... Anyways, check the docs.
Sep 15 23:12:57 <w1d3m0d3>	(happened on gentoo and debian)
Sep 15 23:15:55 <anxt>	Can intel video and nvidia binary driver coexist on the same system?
Sep 15 23:16:00 <snails>	If I included Ralink rt27xx/rt28xx/rt30xx (USB) support  <--- as a module then how do I find the name to modprobe ?
Sep 15 23:16:15 <w1d3m0d3>	anxt: yes
Sep 15 23:16:21 <w1d3m0d3>	why not/
Sep 15 23:16:27 <w1d3m0d3>	s|/|?|
Sep 15 23:16:31 <oc2k1_>	could it be that I need a SELinux kernel to install/update packages in a SELinux chroot? I have an emerge @preserved-rebuild endless loop with "!!! Unable to set SELinux security labels" for  5 packages
Sep 15 23:16:34 <anxt>	i do "locate rt2 | grep /lib/modules"
Sep 15 23:17:16 <assemblyPL_>	i mean can my cpu run those -ftree-vectorize -ftree-slp-vectorize ? these are not listec in /proc/cpuinfo
Sep 15 23:18:17 <oc2k1_>	both options are not CPU but compiler features, they use SSE or AVX
Sep 15 23:18:45 <assemblyPL_>	ok thank you
Sep 15 23:18:47 <redsh>	If you don't know how to look up gcc documentation, then I'd suggest not fiddling with random compiler flags .-.
Sep 15 23:19:03 <assemblyPL_>	i am just tireed
Sep 15 23:19:16 <assemblyPL_>	and i want to have it compiling while i sleep
Sep 15 23:19:47 <assemblyPL_>	so i just want to setup the flags to compile world and go to sleep
Sep 15 23:20:00 <redsh>	anxt: menuconfig says 'When compiled as a module, this driver will be called "rt2800pci.ko".'
Sep 15 23:20:33 <redsh>	So, rt2800pci
Sep 15 23:20:42 <redsh>	Err, snails
Sep 15 23:20:45 <snails>	how do I know that my foo.ko will be called when I compile foo as a module ?
Sep 15 23:20:50 <snails>	oh ok
Sep 15 23:26:02 <snails>	redsh: are you refering to make's menuconfig ?
Sep 15 23:26:38 <snails>	http://codepad.org/RzrJrfpm  Where did you find that information from this screen?
Sep 15 23:26:49 <snails>	the 'When compiled as a module...'
Sep 15 23:28:33 <assemblyPL_>	are fortran fcflags etc important?
Sep 15 23:29:37 <redsh>	snails: Hit 'h' while over "Ralink rt27xx/rt28xx/rt30xx (USB) support"
Sep 15 23:30:31 <snails>	redsh: thanks.  didn't know about that.
Sep 15 23:30:32 <redsh>	Err, wait, it's rt2500usb, not *pci .-.
Sep 15 23:31:16 <redsh>	I was over the PCI stuff.
Sep 15 23:31:30 <assemblyPL_>	why are so many disabled with march=native??   -mmwaitx                    		[disabled]  -mno-align-stringops        		[disabled]  -mno-default                		[disabled]  -mno-fancy-math-387         		[disabled]  -mno-push-args              		[disabled]  -mno-red-zone               		[disabled]  -mno-sse4                   		[disabled]
Sep 15 23:31:30 <assemblyPL_>	-mnop-mcount                		[disabled]
Sep 15 23:31:42 <assemblyPL_>	more : https://pastebin.com/VheH5CLw
Sep 15 23:34:28 <kurly>	assemblyPL_: what problem are you trying to solve or create? :)
Sep 15 23:35:07 <kurly>	aggressive CFLAGS are usually not particularly helpful and can be actively harmful
Sep 15 23:35:40 <Menelkir>	and usually native uses "sane" flags
Sep 15 23:35:49 <mroh>	w1d3m0d3: see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/admin-guide/bug-hunting.rst for starting debugging the kernel...
Sep 15 23:36:02 <assemblyPL_>	+ kurly i check if march+native works and it seems like almost noithing is enabled
Sep 15 23:36:25 <assemblyPL_>	it seems like in my march there is problem ?
Sep 15 23:36:34 <Menelkir>	march=native will not enable too much flags, mtune=native otherwise will enable more
Sep 15 23:36:40 <w1d3m0d3>	didn't know about that doc, thanks
Sep 15 23:37:05 <assemblyPL_>	should i enable mtune inestead of march?
Sep 15 23:37:17 <assemblyPL_>	Menelkir i m,aybe enable both?
Sep 15 23:37:21 <Menelkir>	I use both and never had a problem that I didn't caused :D
Sep 15 23:37:27 <assemblyPL_>	:D
Sep 15 23:37:40 <oc2k1_>	march mean only on this CPU, mtune means this CPU optimized but will still run on others
Sep 15 23:38:40 <assemblyPL_>	well please look : almost all disabled with march native and mtune native : https://pastebin.com/VheH5CLw
Sep 15 23:38:41 <oc2k1_>	march=native on a CPU with AVX will compile code that might not run on a older CPU
Sep 15 23:39:06 <anxt>	oc2k1_, i had a broken _getty_ once from that
Sep 15 23:39:07 <assemblyPL_>	i compile only for this cpu
Sep 15 23:39:20 <anxt>	well surely not avx, but from some missing opcode or something
Sep 15 23:39:30 <redsh>	`-march=native -mtune=native` and `-march=native` seem to be completely equivalent to me.
Sep 15 23:40:02 <assemblyPL_>	redsh how to enable all these flags ? https://pastebin.com/VheH5CLw march native has them almost all disabled
Sep 15 23:40:38 <assemblyPL_>	do i just colpy them to make.conf?
Sep 15 23:40:58 *	kurly raises an eyebrow
Sep 15 23:41:07 <redsh>	gcc doesn't seem to think you have support for all of that...
Sep 15 23:41:08 <kurly>	Menelkir: that's not how mtune works
Sep 15 23:41:51 <kurly>	assemblyPL_: still not sure what problem you are trying to solve
Sep 15 23:41:56 <redsh>	Besides, I doubt you're building for musl, android/bionic and glibc at the same time, or on a CPU with MPX/AVX/etc instructions.
Sep 15 23:42:54 <assemblyPL_>	redsh this is the output of "gcc -c -Q -march=native -O3 -mtune=native --help=target " the disabled list
Sep 15 23:43:09 <kurly>	using -O3 globally is a Bad Idea
Sep 15 23:43:23 <kurly>	and adding -mtune=native to -march=native is mostly nonsense
Sep 15 23:43:29 <redsh>	Indeed. And, as I said, gcc doesn't think you have support for a lot of things.
Sep 15 23:44:00 <kurly>	is the problem that you don't have a more compelling problem to work on? :D
Sep 15 23:44:03 <redsh>	Forcing those things on while rebuilding world miiight give you a broken install.
Sep 15 23:44:57 <redsh>	And then you'll come back tomorrow with "why does running literally anything give me SIGILL?"
Sep 15 23:45:33 <assemblyPL_>	does gcc currently not detect cpu supported features?
Sep 15 23:45:43 <redsh>	It does. And you don't have those features.
Sep 15 23:46:43 <redsh>	Do you have any specific issue with any of those lines, where you know your CPU should support the instruction and have evidence?
Sep 15 23:47:03 <assemblyPL_>	well im trying to find some evidence
Sep 15 23:48:07 <assemblyPL_>	redsh for example my cpu supports FMA but in the lis it is disabled
Sep 15 23:48:10 <kurly>	it is usually best to solve problems that exist instead of perceived problems that you aren't sure even exist
Sep 15 23:48:30 <kurly>	unless your CPU is significantly newer than your GCC, it's unlikely that native is leading you astray
Sep 15 23:48:52 <assemblyPL_>	why is DMA disabled? my cpu supports it
Sep 15 23:48:56 <assemblyPL_>	* FMA
Sep 15 23:49:53 <redsh>	assemblyPL_: It's listed in /proc/cpuinfo ?
Sep 15 23:50:21 <w1d3m0d3>	are old dmesg stored anywhere when using ksyslogd
Sep 15 23:50:48 <assemblyPL_>	redsh no, it is listed here https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/core_i7/i7-620m#Features
Sep 15 23:51:17 <redsh>	"Fast Memory Access"?
Sep 15 23:51:25 <redsh>	FMA = Fused multiply-add.
Sep 15 23:51:51 <redsh>	Whatever it's talking about isn't the CPU instruction FMA.
Sep 15 23:52:31 <assemblyPL_>	"gcc -c -Q -march=native -O2 --help=target|grep fma     -mavx5124fmaps              		[disabled]  -mavx512ifma                		[disabled]  -mfma                       		[disabled]  -mfma4                      		[disabled]"
Sep 15 23:52:43 <redsh>	assemblyPL_: Did you read what I just wrote/
Sep 15 23:54:08 <redsh>	fwiw, I have fma listed in /proc/cpuinfo and it's marked as enabled by that command.
Sep 15 23:56:28 <redsh>	Oh, and Haswells were the first with FMA, it seems?
Sep 15 23:57:20 <oc2k1_>	yes, hasswell was the first
Sep 15 23:57:21 <assemblyPL_>	redsh you are correct
Sep 15 23:57:41 <assemblyPL_>	im sorry
Sep 15 23:58:11 <assemblyPL_>	(im just tired, want to compile world while i sleep)
Sep 15 23:58:42 <assemblyPL_>	(just need to setup a few things and zzz)
Sep 15 23:59:56 <BonusSoda>	Hiya!
Sep 16 00:01:16 <assemblyPL_>	hiya BonusSoda
Sep 16 00:02:51 <BonusSoda>	hi :D
Sep 16 00:06:56 <assemblyPL_>	do i need to add alsthe cpu flags to etc/portage/package.use/00cpuflags ??

Sep 16 00:27:41 <assemblyPL_>	about his thing *
Sep 16 00:27:48 <assemblyPL_>	* about this thing
Sep 16 00:28:14 <m1dgard>	yeah i heard about kitty, i'll see what it gives.
Sep 16 00:29:35 <m1dgard>	ah, that's why i didn't install it: it's masked. https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/x11-terms/kitty
Sep 16 00:30:08 <kurly>	it's in ~amd64, not package masked
Sep 16 00:30:26 <assemblyPL_>	Kelsar should i "At this point, the standard install documentation can be picked up at Preparing the Disks. However, when asked to mount the proc system, issue the following command instead:root #mount -o bind /proc /mnt/gentoo/proc" ? or just "mount --types proc /proc /mnt/gentoo/proc " like it says in the STandard haandbook install?
Sep 16 00:30:45 <snails>	hi.
Sep 16 00:30:52 <assemblyPL_>	snails hi
Sep 16 00:31:26 <m1dgard>	kurly: this means it has not been tested enough to make sure we can call it "stable", but it should be fine to just use it if it's not mission-critical, right?
Sep 16 00:31:37 <kurly>	correct
Sep 16 00:31:47 <snails>	Ever since I installed os-prober grub-mkconfig no longer adds the new kernel name to /boot/grub/grub.conf
Sep 16 00:31:56 <snails>	had to do a sed substitution with the version number
Sep 16 00:32:05 <assemblyPL_>	how to mount the proc from susyrescuecd?
Sep 16 00:32:29 <mroh>	assemblyPL_, m1dgard: the cpu time is in sway. so another term wouldnt change anything...
Sep 16 00:33:09 <assemblyPL_>	shgould i bind it or not? The two different instal guides are confoosing me
Sep 16 00:35:26 <liqsquid>	i always bind it.
Sep 16 00:35:31 <kurly>	"standard install document"? there's a handbook, you should use that
Sep 16 00:35:57 <liqsquid>	you should always follow the manual
Sep 16 00:36:18 <m1dgard>	mroh, assemblyPL_: indeed, same thing on kitty. the CPU percentages are the same.
Sep 16 00:36:22 <assemblyPL_>	liqquid there is also https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Installation_alternatives#Installation_instructions
Sep 16 00:36:35 <assemblyPL_>	they are contradicktory

Sep 16 00:40:22 <liqsquid>	assemblyPL_, both are telling to bind /proc
Sep 16 00:41:14 <assemblyPL_>	liqsquid i mean the comands are not the identical
Sep 16 00:42:28 <m1dgard>	hm. the sway log says "No render frame received in 0.250000 seconds, re-requesting at: xxx" upon each htop update, where xxx is approximate seconds since the launch of the terminal
Sep 16 00:48:36 <kurly>	assemblyPL_: handbook. use it. :)
Sep 16 00:51:04 <liqsquid>	assemblyPL_:
Sep 16 00:51:04 <liqsquid>	mount(8) since v2.27 allows to change the mount options by passing the relevant options along with --bind.  For example:
Sep 16 00:51:04 <liqsquid>	              mount -o bind,ro foo foo
Sep 16 00:51:04 <liqsquid>	       This feature is not supported by the Linux kernel; it is implemented in userspace by an additional mount(2) remounting system call.  This  solution  is  not

Sep 16 00:52:13 <redsh>	What alternative do you suggest then?
Sep 16 00:55:04 <redsh>	I think it's talking about mounting with changed mount options compared to the original mount being unsupported by the kernel.

Sep 16 09:54:47 <assemblyPL_>	regardless of "-*" USE flag i still get this error
Sep 16 09:54:57 <assemblyPL_>	  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:    any-of ( python_targets_python3_5 python_targets_python3_6 python_targets_python3_7 )
Sep 16 09:58:41 <assemblyPL_>	ok so it works after changing it to pyhton 3_6
Sep 16 09:58:52 <assemblyPL_>	but i want python 3_7
Sep 16 10:00:14 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: python3_7 is masked for stable systems
Sep 16 10:00:50 <assemblyPL_>	wokko python 3.7.4 is the current upstream stable version
Sep 16 10:01:11 <assemblyPL_>	why is the stable version masked for stable systems?
Sep 16 10:01:35 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: this is gentoo which does things a little different than upstream
Sep 16 10:02:15 <assemblyPL_>	wokko okey... where do i find out more about how gentoo does different?
Sep 16 10:02:57 <Skunky>	assemblyPL_: just because they say it's stable doesn't mean gentoo says it works for all the things that are "stable" on gentoo.  gentoo is VERY dependent on python... feed a gentoo system a broken python, and you're borked.
Sep 16 10:03:00 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: you can reverse it if you like
Sep 16 10:03:23 <Skunky>	assemblyPL_: you can, of course, always unmask anything you want.
Sep 16 10:04:40 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: Create a /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask file with '-python_targets_python3_7 -python_single_target_python3_7' in it
Sep 16 10:05:06 <wokko>	this will allow you to have python3_7
Sep 16 10:05:31 <assemblyPL_>	wokko okey so if python3.7 would be problem i can just change it back to 3.6 and all will be okey?
Sep 16 10:05:52 <assemblyPL_>	i can reverse and then no problem?
Sep 16 10:06:32 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: You should be fine with python3_7 but no money back if problems occur :)
Sep 16 10:07:30 <assemblyPL_>	okey thanks :D
Sep 16 10:08:13 <doc235>	if you break it you own both halves :)
Sep 16 10:08:52 <assemblyPL_>	halves? i dont much understand
Sep 16 10:08:52 <wokko>	:)
Sep 16 10:12:10 <assemblyPL_>	Skunky --- Invalid USE flag in '/etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask': '-python_targets_python3_7 -python_single_target_python3_7'
Sep 16 10:12:58 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: single line only, one option per line
Sep 16 10:15:29 <assemblyPL_>	okey now it working :D    .. but emerge -u python sees no upgrade and eselect python list shows python 3.6
Sep 16 10:16:04 <wokko>	I should have done it like you do it in assembly coding '-python_targets_python3_7  n_line -python_single_target_python3_7'
Sep 16 10:17:14 <assemblyPL_>	haha :)
Sep 16 10:17:52 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: emerge -av1 python:3.7
Sep 16 10:18:30 <assemblyPL_>	:D  great
Sep 16 10:42:59 <assemblyPL_>	do i need openssh? it is installed dfrault and i dont think i need it
Sep 16 10:43:47 <assemblyPL_>	default
Sep 16 10:46:20 <Skunky>	assemblyPL_: is your machine not connected to the internet?
Sep 16 10:47:50 <Skunky>	assemblyPL_: or for that matter not connected to a network at all?  ssh is kinda useful for most people.
Sep 16 10:49:04 <assemblyPL_>	i undertsand ssh i connection type for controlling another pc shell or trasnfer files
Sep 16 10:49:04 <ratrace>	one can still have a machine connected to network and not needing ssh. the question is really: do you need to use the ssh connection protocol? the answer to that is the answer to the original question.
Sep 16 10:49:22 <assemblyPL_>	i dont think web browsing needs ssh?
Sep 16 10:49:49 <assemblyPL_>	nor does emerge/portage?
Sep 16 10:50:16 <Skunky>	it's handy for things like managing the machine in the basement when you're on the 2nd floor.  or the machine at home, when you're at work.
Sep 16 10:50:45 <assemblyPL_>	yeah that is what i thought
Sep 16 10:50:59 <assemblyPL_>	:)
Sep 16 10:51:05 <assemblyPL_>	but i will remove it
Sep 16 10:52:31 <josef64>	it is in @system set (virtual/ssh)
Sep 16 10:52:31 <josef64>	please let it installed, it is not default enabled in default runlevel
Sep 16 10:52:52 <assemblyPL_>	josef64 but it takes compile time
Sep 16 10:54:03 <josef64>	it compiles fast :)
Sep 16 10:54:39 <josef64>	qlop -v openssh
Sep 16 10:54:39 <josef64>	2019-06-22T23:02:05 >>> net-misc/openssh: 1′10″
Sep 16 10:55:23 <assemblyPL_>	i like minimalism
Sep 16 10:55:38 <assemblyPL_>	the less you have the less problems you get
Sep 16 10:55:51 <assemblyPL_>	"KISS"
Sep 16 10:56:15 <Kelsar>	assemblyPL_: for that you are making yourself a lot of trouble
Sep 16 10:58:05 <ratrace>	Hmmm what is wrong with this picture: a gentoo user being criticized for trying to use gentoo as designed: USE (flag) only what you want and how you want it.
Sep 16 11:00:05 <assemblyPL_>	Kelsar i guess if something will neeed there will ba an error about it
Sep 16 11:00:15 <assemblyPL_>	then i can emerge it
Sep 16 11:00:50 <Kelsar>	ratrace: he is not criticized, but what he is doing and what is saying are two different things ;)
Sep 16 11:01:54 <assemblyPL_>	josef64 # emerge --pretend @system|grep openssh     nothing
Sep 16 11:02:44 <josef64>	emerge -avc virtual/ssh
Sep 16 11:03:41 <assemblyPL_>	josef64: "emerge -avc virtual/sshCalculating dependencies... done!  virtual/ssh-0 pulled in by:    @system requires virtual/ssh>>> No packages selected for removal by depcleanPackages installed:   215Packages in world:    2Packages in system:   43Required packages:    215Number removed:       0"
Sep 16 11:04:07 <josef64>	yes, it works :)
Sep 16 11:04:43 <assemblyPL_>	i dont understand
Sep 16 11:04:53 <assemblyPL_>	what are you telling me this?
Sep 16 11:05:09 <assemblyPL_>	:)
Sep 16 11:07:18 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: virtual/ssh is part of @system which requires openssh
Sep 16 11:07:26 <wokko>	basically
Sep 16 11:07:39 <josef64>	assemblyPL_: It contains the required system tools
Sep 16 11:08:08 <assemblyPL_>	what will not work if i remove openssh?
Sep 16 11:08:31 <josef64>	I think it is a bad idea uninstalled these
Sep 16 11:08:45 <wokko>	it will just get pulled back in with next world update
Sep 16 11:09:42 <assemblyPL_>	okey :D  i remove it and will get puilled back
Sep 16 11:09:58 <assemblyPL_>	thanks wokko you answer me good
Sep 16 11:11:45 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: You could if you really wanted too is to look at 'package.provided' from 'man portage'
Sep 16 11:12:23 <assemblyPL_>	i is noob sorry i read all the time and havent got to that yet im learning
Sep 16 11:12:54 <assemblyPL_>	i mean i used to gentoo a few years ago but memory short
Sep 16 11:14:00 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: basically you add a 'categorg/package-version' to the file to trick portage into thinbking it is installed
Sep 16 11:15:17 <porchetta>	can someone help me solve this conflict?
Sep 16 11:15:19 <porchetta>	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/yP9Bbb6KTv/
Sep 16 11:16:01 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: but ssh is a wonderful tool to have, esepecially if you work and want to use your pc at home from work
Sep 16 11:17:25 <wokko>	porchetta: run 'dispatch-conf' first to clear line 10
Sep 16 11:18:34 <assemblyPL_>	i wish i ciuld have it working but semms my (rooted) android has some problematics on windows so maybe i try it on gentoo
Sep 16 11:18:41 <assemblyPL_>	could *
Sep 16 11:19:18 <porchetta>	ok
Sep 16 11:21:40 <wokko>	porchetta: do you really want vlock? it hasn't had a update since 2013 :)
Sep 16 11:22:58 <porchetta>	is there an alternative to vlock?
Sep 16 11:23:01 <porchetta>	I use it a lot
Sep 16 11:23:08 <porchetta>	also, why does it need updating?
Sep 16 11:23:19 <lagfra>	porchetta: also, why are you excluding vlock in your emerge invocation?
Sep 16 11:23:32 <porchetta>	oh, that was a test. I want to update it
Sep 16 11:24:17 <lagfra>	have you tried updating kbd by itself?
Sep 16 11:26:23 <assemblyPL_>	does libxml2 use flag enable better performance?
Sep 16 11:27:33 <assemblyPL_>	emacs has it, is it important...
Sep 16 11:29:25 <porchetta>	porchetta: getting the same conflict
Sep 16 11:30:50 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: emacs handles xml internal just fine but it is your choice
Sep 16 11:32:45 <wokko>	porchetta: you do know kbd has /usr/bin/vlock included ?
Sep 16 11:34:00 <lagfra>	porchetta: it could be that the conflict depends on the 'pam' use flag, which they both have
Sep 16 11:34:11 <assemblyPL_>	ok i have it disabled :D
Sep 16 11:34:15 <lagfra>	wokko: nice to know
Sep 16 11:35:34 <porchetta>	oh yes, it includes vlock
Sep 16 11:35:45 <wokko>	lagfra: Yeah thats why I was wondering why porchetta wanted vlock itself
Sep 16 11:37:01 <assemblyPL_>	emerge uses all cores at about 30% sometimes the 4th one at 100%, can i run another emerge simultaneously?
Sep 16 11:37:26 <porchetta>	but the standalone one is better: it fixes bug from kbd (https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/63128) and allows to lock from X sessions
Sep 16 11:37:31 <porchetta>	so I need the standalone one
Sep 16 11:38:22 <oc2k1_>	running emerge in parallel works in some cases, but if both commands have the same dependencies it will emerge the dependencies multiple times....
Sep 16 11:39:19 <oc2k1_>	and maybe they collide inside the build directories if emerged at the same time (there is at least a lock on the install part)
Sep 16 11:40:05 <Kelsar>	assemblyPL_: configure runs singe threaded, regardless of MAKEOPTS, you can however use emerge --jobs=, see man emerge
Sep 16 11:40:25 <Kelsar>	assemblyPL_: but keep in mind, emerge jobs and MAKEOPTS multiplie each other
Sep 16 11:41:20 <assemblyPL_>	i have 4cores.. so 16 threads? is that too much?
Sep 16 11:41:59 <assemblyPL_>	or should i set both to "2"?
Sep 16 11:42:10 <Kelsar>	hwo do you get from 4 cores to 16 threads?
Sep 16 11:42:13 <oc2k1_>	emerge --jobs= looks nice but less entertaining than a  running microwave...
Sep 16 11:42:15 <wokko>	porchetta: it says in that bug 'Seems to be a configuration issue - if I replace pam_deny.so with pam_unix.so at '/etc/pam.d/others ', the program works as expected.' not sure if the issue is the same in Gentoo tho ?
Sep 16 11:42:22 <Kelsar>	is this a Power Architecture?
Sep 16 11:43:17 <assemblyPL_>	Kelsar "i7 620m (westmere)" 4 cores so  makeopts j4 "multiply" emerge therads "4" = 16
Sep 16 11:43:42 <Kelsar>	if you set 4 jobs on each, it will start upto 16 jobs, yes
Sep 16 11:44:07 <Kelsar>	there are loadavg depending setting for MAKEOPTS and emerge too, just read the manpages
Sep 16 11:44:28 <oc2k1_>	In that case I would say it depends on the available ram, to many threads are problematic if the machine starts swapping
Sep 16 11:45:57 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: Haven't you got a minimal system setup? so these extra options will be a waste of time ?
Sep 16 11:46:47 <assemblyPL_>	wokko i am still in chroot still
Sep 16 11:47:04 <assemblyPL_>	i procrastinate the genkernel
Sep 16 11:47:29 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: Ha you are still installing gentoo?
Sep 16 11:47:51 <assemblyPL_>	well i could just genkernel etc but ilivecd is not much problem for now
Sep 16 11:48:15 <assemblyPL_>	it is not like gentoo is gonna be deleted after reboot
Sep 16 11:48:24 <assemblyPL_>	i can use emacs from chroot this is good
Sep 16 11:49:45 <assemblyPL_>	:D  good news  emacs tarts up faster than i blink! and on windows it took 20 seconds loll
Sep 16 11:49:50 <Triffid_Hunter>	hmm this is odd.. dhcpcd keeps complaining that "renew failed, rebinding", yet wireshark shows that the server is responding to renew requests, but dhcpcd ignores them.. it accepts the rebind response though, which is odd since it's bit-for-bit identical to the renew response
Sep 16 11:49:52 <assemblyPL_>	starts up
Sep 16 11:49:59 <assemblyPL_>	this is crazy fast :D
Sep 16 11:51:17 <assemblyPL_>	gentoo <3
Sep 16 11:51:21 <assemblyPL_>	haha
Sep 16 11:51:21 <wokko>	assemblyPL_: emacs is quite good on Gentoo, works well as a window manager too :)
Sep 16 11:51:34 <assemblyPL_>	yes :>
Sep 16 11:51:42 <Triffid_Hunter>	assemblyPL_: heh I'm so used to my machine going cold to desktop in 10 seconds flat I'm often surprised when others machines (usually with other OSes) aren't nearly that quick
Sep 16 11:51:46 <assemblyPL_>	i probably use it as WM too
Sep 16 11:52:23 <porchetta>	wokko, in any case I would prefer the standalone vlock executable. Is there a way to have both kbd and vlock? Is kbd needed by @system
Sep 16 11:52:26 <assemblyPL_>	yeah well i never reallly have time to spend 2 days to setup gentoo etc from scratch after long break i have short memory
Sep 16 11:52:53 <assemblyPL_>	wish it could be better documented , maybe i will do that in future
Sep 16 11:53:58 <wokko>	porchetta: you want kbd if you use a console and want fonts ")
Sep 16 11:53:59 <assemblyPL_>	Triffid_Hunter (gentoo used to start for me in like 7 seconds i think on my FX 9590 8 core 4,5ghz ...)
Sep 16 11:54:47 <wokko>	porchetta: run 'qlist kbd'
Sep 16 11:55:48 <assemblyPL_>	the 10 seconds or 7 seconds not much differenced :)
Sep 16 11:56:19 <Triffid_Hunter>	assemblyPL_: well I could probably shave it down if I ditched grub or used something other than KDE
Sep 16 11:57:41 <assemblyPL_>	or keep gentoo alive :D
Sep 16 11:57:50 <assemblyPL_>	no shuttdown
Sep 16 11:58:20 <assemblyPL_>	efibootmgr seems interesting
Sep 16 11:58:29 <assemblyPL_>	:)
Sep 16 12:00:22 <Triffid_Hunter>	assemblyPL_: well one of my VPSes has an uptime of over 2 years, mostly because it's too resource constrained to update itself any further than it is now and my internet is too unreliable to do it remotely
Sep 16 12:00:59 <Triffid_Hunter>	assemblyPL_: but on my daily driver I like to keep the kernel reasonably up to date (currently 5.2.4 and feeling like it's time to up again)
Sep 16 12:01:50 <porchetta>	wokko: ok, I understand. Still, is there a way to have vlock installed alongside?
Sep 16 12:02:07 <assemblyPL_>	well i always used the mainline upstream versions and never had problems
Sep 16 12:02:17 <assemblyPL_>	kernel and python etc
Sep 16 12:02:57 <assemblyPL_>	rarely chromium has rfendering glitches with all the performance etc chrome://flags enabled
Sep 16 12:03:15 <wokko>	porchetta: I'm not sure, unless you dont upgrade kbd, then you will stil have both ?
Sep 16 12:03:23 <assemblyPL_>	i had gentoo for about a year
Sep 16 12:03:49 <wokko>	porchetta: what does vlock give as its binary ?
Sep 16 12:03:50 <assemblyPL_>	then my motherboard didnt start for some reason
Sep 16 12:04:04 <porchetta>	what do you mean?
Sep 16 12:04:06 <assemblyPL_>	probably electrcity surge
Sep 16 12:04:23 <wokko>	porchetta: is it the same file /usr/bin/vlock ?
Sep 16 12:05:30 <porchetta>	in the current status, which vlock returns /usr/bin/vlock and I have both kbd and vlock installed
Sep 16 12:07:08 <wokko>	porchetta: mmm, yeah not sure its up to you, mask the current version of kbd maybe and deal with it at a latter date ???
Sep 16 12:07:24 <wokko>	later*
Sep 16 12:08:23 <wokko>	oh no you cant aas there is only one version for stable
Sep 16 12:09:38 <porchetta>	mmm
Sep 16 12:09:57 *	wokko says times like this..... pot the kettle on for a coffee :)
Sep 16 12:11:47 <Mo>	Hi, any idea when gentoo-sources-5.2.15 will arrive, as it fixes a bad regression on btrfs?
Sep 16 12:13:22 <assemblyPL_>	Mo maybe use git-sources
Sep 16 12:14:38 <assemblyPL_>	if it problem then choose old version, but it is stable only gentoo is extra cautious
Sep 16 12:15:00 <assemblyPL_>	at boot select kernel from grub is easy
Sep 16 12:15:38 <oc2k1_>	which regression ?
Sep 16 12:31:19 <Mo>	oc2k1_: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11141559/
Sep 16 12:34:58 <josef64>	Mo: It is now in current Kernel https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.2.15
Sep 16 12:35:55 <Mo>	I know, therefore waiting for gentoo-sources-5.2.15
Sep 16 12:36:10 <josef64>	Ah, ok :)
Sep 16 12:41:09 <snatcher>	why fonts packages (noto for example) is pre-built?
Sep 16 12:46:42 <assemblyPL_>	how to apply package.regression for ALL versions?
Sep 16 12:48:45 <Kelsar>	package.regression?
Sep 16 12:49:32 <assemblyPL_>	* package.provided
Sep 16 12:49:38 <assemblyPL_>	i just added the openssh version
Sep 16 12:49:48 <assemblyPL_>	and depclean removed nano and xauth :D
Sep 16 12:50:34 <assemblyPL_>	because i removed the openssh as well
Sep 16 12:51:16 <BtbN>	That seems like a seriously bad idea oO
Sep 16 12:51:48 <assemblyPL_>	i only use emacs
Sep 16 12:51:51 <assemblyPL_>	nano is weak
Sep 16 12:52:21 <BtbN>	I fail to see how that related to ssh.
Sep 16 12:52:51 <assemblyPL_>	i dont know either
Sep 16 12:52:56 <assemblyPL_>	it just happened
Sep 16 12:53:14 <BtbN>	It just happend that you added it to pkg.provided? oO
Sep 16 12:53:33 <assemblyPL_>	no the depclean that i removed nano and xauth
Sep 16 12:53:41 <assemblyPL_>	i dont want openssh
Sep 16 12:54:07 <BtbN>	You can't just add something you don't want to pkg.provided.
Sep 16 12:54:11 <BtbN>	Stuff depends on it for a reason.
Sep 16 12:55:12 <assemblyPL_>	virtual-ssh depends on openssh
Sep 16 12:55:24 <assemblyPL_>	what would be a vrtual ssh needed for
Sep 16 12:55:41 <BtbN>	Check what depends on it.
Sep 16 12:56:35 <stintel>	any idea why `qlop -gHv firefox` shows only 3 builds (from 7 years ago), while `genlop -t firefox` shows 88?
Sep 16 12:56:47 <assemblyPL_>	BtbN i tried before "emerge -pv --depclean virtual/ssh-0!!! 'virtual/ssh-0' is not a valid package atom.!!! Please check ebuild(5) for full details."
Sep 16 12:57:11 <BtbN>	You depclean the package, not a specific version
Sep 16 12:57:18 <BtbN>	and if you want a specific version, you are missing the =
Sep 16 12:58:04 <Kelsar>	ssh is just in the @system set
Sep 16 12:58:56 <BtbN>	Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if not having an ssh client would break a bunch of stuff.
Sep 16 12:59:41 <assemblyPL_>	then it is easy to isnatll openssh again isnt it?
Sep 16 12:59:43 <Kelsar>	not even the client, but the library
Sep 16 13:00:16 <josef64>	stintel: Try the new stable portage-utils-0.80 with `qlop -v firefox` It works fine here :)
Sep 16 13:00:26 <BtbN>	Just yesterday you had trouble even installing the system, and now you are actively working to break it...
Sep 16 13:00:51 <assemblyPL_>	i was tried
Sep 16 13:01:01 <assemblyPL_>	tired and i tried and now i progress
Sep 16 13:01:18 <chris-lx141_>	hey guys, is here some LXD/LXC guru ?
Sep 16 13:02:14 <assemblyPL_>	how to rebuild only all the packges that CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS march native would make different?
Sep 16 13:03:28 <chris-lx141_>	I have broken profile attached into several containers which where running with for some time and I just reliased 'root' key where in that profile but somehow ignored in containers, now can't detach that profile because it errors about missing root device
Sep 16 13:22:13 <assemblyPL_>	so how is gcc 9.2 on gentoo  going? any remarks?
Sep 16 13:34:29 *	ChanServ gives voice to blueness
Sep 16 13:37:48 <yeti_s>	No problems here.
Sep 16 13:38:20 <yeti_s>	Two machines, fully lto'd. Did have some funny business with openssl the other day but not sure the cause.

Sep 16 15:47:18 <wokko>	newbieG: whats that kernel line option for uvcvideo suppose to do?
Sep 16 15:48:44 <newbieG>	wokko: to get verbose info about uvcvideo
Sep 16 15:50:56 <wokko>	newbieG: mmm, dmesg looks fine in regards to finding your webcam, so not sure why you don't have a /dev/video* node
Sep 16 15:52:10 <wokko>	newbieG: stab in the dark but is your drivers for it builtin or as a module?
Sep 16 15:57:51 <emperor7>	What is the easiest way for me to add the old science overlay to my Gentoo repos.conf dir?
Sep 16 15:58:55 <emperor7>	Sorry, new IRC client for me....

Sep 16 15:59:26 <johntheclam>	Hello,
Sep 16 16:00:07 <johntheclam>	Is "XSESSION=GNOME exec startx" correct or am i missing something?
Sep 16 16:00:40 <iamben>	johntheclam: your XSESSION value needs to match up exactly to a file in /etc/X11/Sessions
Sep 16 16:00:44 <grknight>	emperor7: eselect repository add sci git https://github.com/gentoo/sci.git   *or* eselect repository add sci git https://anongit.gentoo.org/git/proj/sci.git
Sep 16 16:00:50 <iamben>	and i dont see any reason for exec here
Sep 16 16:00:53 <leio>	make sure you don't have a ~/.xinitrc, and the XSESSION value is "Gnome", not "GNOME"
Sep 16 16:01:04 <leio>	and heavily suggesting to use a desktop login manager, like gdm
Sep 16 16:01:52 <grknight>	emperor7: sorry, science, not sci before git
Sep 16 16:01:56 <johntheclam>	Im just trying if gnome starts because its crashing on gdm
Sep 16 16:02:13 <johntheclam>	fresh install
Sep 16 16:02:34 <leio>	XSESSION=Gnome startx
Sep 16 16:02:35 <leio>	should do it
Sep 16 16:03:48 <johntheclam>	thanks, apparently i get conection refused...
Sep 16 16:04:50 <fling>	how do I control spectre/meltdown mitigations properly?
Sep 16 16:04:51 <johntheclam>	no screens found
Sep 16 16:05:27 <kerframil>	control in what sense?
Sep 16 16:05:28 <emperor7>	grknight: I get the error  Can't load module repository.  Is that because it isn't a valid layman entry now?
Sep 16 16:07:09 <kerframil>	emperor7: it's because you haven't installed eselect-repository
Sep 16 16:08:24 <iamben>	fling: mostly just get an up to date kernel & cpu microcode updates
Sep 16 16:08:48 <iamben>	app-admin/spectre-meltdown-checker can help analyze your current situation
Sep 16 16:09:01 <fling>	iamben: I want to disable some/all mitigations
Sep 16 16:09:40 <iamben>	the ones that have performance implications, i assume
Sep 16 16:09:47 <kerframil>	fling: read the official linux admin-guide then, including kernel-parameters.txt
Sep 16 16:10:19 <fling>	iamben: probably, no need for mitigations when not running blobs or public facing services.
Sep 16 16:10:25 <fling>	kerframil: thanks
Sep 16 16:10:52 <kerframil>	fling: the "mitigations" parameter is a good place to start
Sep 16 16:10:57 *	fling found ./admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt
Sep 16 16:12:15 <fling>	mitigations= looks good, thanks.
Sep 16 16:14:58 <ajak>	if i'm getting binary packages selected for rebuild with a world update, should i allow it to use the binpkg or should i rebuild it?
Sep 16 16:15:36 <ajak>	(i should specify, the package doesn't come as a binary, i just have a binpkg available with --usepkg=y)
Sep 16 16:17:47 <kerframil>	if it was generated earlier by the same host then you probably shouldn't use it. otherwise, the effect of deliberate rebuilding is defeated. it works better when you have a dedicated build host that does not, itself, consume binary packages.
Sep 16 16:17:52 <sIbOk>	Hi, would someone be so kind to tell me whats wrong on column i? It is supposed to sum col F base on comparing col A against col H. Thanks anyway. :)
Sep 16 16:18:02 <sIbOk>	Sorry, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NIbLAKKhqrJ8aWOadPz6oG0fgvgmVf4QRjJHVhIa72U/edit#gid=0
Sep 16 16:18:12 <sIbOk>	Sheet, wrong channel
Sep 16 16:19:03 <fling>	What are other tools like distcc to speedup things on slower hardware?
Sep 16 16:19:40 <iamben>	fling: build binpkgs on newer hardware, then share them with the slower hardware
Sep 16 16:19:44 <kerframil>	^ this
Sep 16 16:19:50 <grknight>	emperor7: you'll need to 'emerge eselect-repository' if you want to use that method
Sep 16 16:20:10 <Menelkir>	a chroot for that is neat
Sep 16 16:20:27 <fling>	yeah, emerging with ROOT and PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT works fine
Sep 16 16:20:41 <fling>	I'm just asking in general what if there is something I don't know about
Sep 16 16:20:42 <fling>	maybe new :D
Sep 16 16:20:48 <iamben>	maybe magical?
Sep 16 16:20:53 <iamben>	nope =)
Sep 16 16:20:54 <fling>	sure
Sep 16 16:20:56 <fling>	ok ;>
Sep 16 16:21:13 <dacencora>	Any idea for this error message when using wpgtk?
Sep 16 16:21:17 <kerframil>	fling: do you use luks?
Sep 16 16:21:20 <dacencora>	gi.repository.GLib.Error: gdk-pixbuf-error-quark: Couldn’t recognize the image file format for file .jpg
Sep 16 16:21:24 <fling>	pypy speeds up portage by like ~30% on fast hardware btw
Sep 16 16:21:33 <fling>	kerframil: yes.
Sep 16 16:22:04 <fling>	dacencora: enable jpeg use flag on x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf
Sep 16 16:22:20 <dacencora>	sounds good
Sep 16 16:22:23 <dacencora>	I will try that
Sep 16 16:22:29 <kerframil>	fling: in case your hardware is old enough not to support aes-ni, use a >=5.0 kernel and adiantum.
Sep 16 16:22:30 <grknight>	dacencora: it's broken in the latest version.. 691348
Sep 16 16:22:32 <grknight>	bug 691348
Sep 16 16:22:35 <willikins>	grknight: https://bugs.gentoo.org/691348 "x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf-2.38.1 : [TEST]  9/22 gdk-pixbuf:format / pixbuf-jpeg FAIL  (killed by signal 6 SIGABRT)"; Gentoo Linux, Current packages; CONF; toralf:gnome
Sep 16 16:22:37 <kerframil>	fling: it'll perform much better.
Sep 16 16:22:42 <fling>	D'oh!
Sep 16 16:22:55 <Fersure>	Hi guys, I have a quick question if it's not too annoying; do you offer 'user vhosts' at all?
Sep 16 16:23:11 <dacencora>	Oh dang it!
Sep 16 16:23:46 <fling>	kerframil: what is adiantum? I only switched to blowfish from serpent yesterday :D
Sep 16 16:24:23 <kerframil>	fling: an excellent cipher that emerged from Google after the attempt by NSA to get SPECK into the kernel was BTFO'd.
Sep 16 16:24:40 <fling>	thanks, going to benchmark
Sep 16 16:24:42 <kerframil>	fling: pretty low computational cost but it's not weak.
Sep 16 16:24:50 <fling>	Do I need luks2 btw?
Sep 16 16:25:13 <kerframil>	fling: no, but you might want it for the fact that it supports Argon2*.
Sep 16 16:25:47 <fling>	Do I need argon2? Is not ripemd good?
Sep 16 16:26:46 <kerframil>	fling: argon2 is the current state-of-the-art, basically. it can make hard work for CPUs and GPUs alike.
Sep 16 16:27:06 <leio>	grknight: err, so that isn't just a test failure?
Sep 16 16:27:16 <fling>	is it fine to use low iteration count?
Sep 16 16:27:22 <fling>	What is safe enough?
Sep 16 16:27:43 <grknight>	leio: yes, but indicates a larger problem
Sep 16 16:28:01 <leio>	does it mean that jpg is broken for people in eog and thumbnailing?
Sep 16 16:28:26 <grknight>	no idea
Sep 16 16:31:11 <kerframil>	fling: I would leave the defaults alone unless the delay is genuinely unacceptable. if so, render it acceptable but no lower. I have not needed to change the defaults and have no recommendations to make.
Sep 16 16:31:14 <emperor7>	Thanks to all who helped me get this working, esp. grknight kerframil and  iamben
Sep 16 16:31:46 <kerframil>	fling: other than to say, I would not employ any method that incurs a temporal cost of less than 2s.
Sep 16 16:31:55 <fling>	the defaults are fine thanks
Sep 16 16:32:20 <grknight>	emperor7: fwiw, eselect repository can replace layman almost entirely (except for bazaar and mercurial repos) and is often much more flexible as you've seen
Sep 16 16:32:43 <acidfreeze>	good morning, I am cross compiling for armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabihf- . I compiled kernel about a week ago with out issue, now I am forgetting a step or something changed, Now when i build kernel complains about include/linux/compiler-gcc.h:106:1: fatal error: linux/compiler-gcc9.h: No such file or directory. I notice that /usr/armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/ doesn't contain gcc-bin. Is it supposed to?
Sep 16 16:32:46 <dacencora>	Is there a reason that USE="windowmode" is not enabled by default for rofi?
Sep 16 16:32:54 <dacencora>	Or did I misconfigure something?
Sep 16 16:33:41 <emperor7>	I love gentoo, but my knowledge of all the nuances of portage and repo management is underwhelming
Sep 16 16:36:26 <fling>	emperor7: tread manpages!

Sep 17 10:49:23 <xantoz>	the size can only be 256
Sep 17 10:49:38 <xantoz>	I usually pick xchacha20,aes-adiantum, though
Sep 17 10:50:02 <xantoz>	although not sure if using adiantum should be recommended at all except for experimentation ATM, since it's so now
Sep 17 10:50:07 <xantoz>	new*
Sep 17 10:50:35 <fling>	xantoz: it says Cipher specification should be in [cipher]-[mode]-[iv] format.
Sep 17 10:51:15 <xantoz>	fling: try xchacha12,aes-adiantum-plain64 ?
Sep 17 10:51:35 <xantoz>	I forgot the last part
Sep 17 10:51:49 <fling>	xantoz: this works, thanks
Sep 17 10:51:52 <fling>	how do I use argon2?
Sep 17 10:52:05 <xantoz>	https://uwot.eu/blog/luks2-the-right-way-argon2/
Sep 17 10:52:10 <fling>	thanks
Sep 17 10:52:24 <xantoz>	also you might want to match block size to your device for better performance
Sep 17 10:52:37 <xantoz>	*sector size*
Sep 17 10:52:40 <fling>	not simple for ssd
Sep 17 10:52:51 <fling>	will probably use 4k as zfs has ashift=12
Sep 17 10:53:05 <xantoz>	yeah, 4k seems to be what the cryptsetup manual recommends as well
Sep 17 10:53:05 <fling>	is argon only supported with luks2?
Sep 17 10:53:07 <xantoz>	yes
Sep 17 10:53:15 <fling>	can I just convert it offline?
Sep 17 10:53:21 <xantoz>	I think cryptsetup still defaults to 512 bytes sector size though
Sep 17 10:53:35 <fling>	ok, no convert then
Sep 17 10:53:36 <xantoz>	fling: I don't know.
Sep 17 10:53:56 <xantoz>	I don't think you can convert from luks1 to luks2?
Sep 17 10:54:00 <xantoz>	or at least I haven't tried it myself
Sep 17 10:54:17 <xantoz>	ah there is a conversion thing actually
Sep 17 10:54:58 <xantoz>	but I wouldn't dare using it without a backup, at which point recreating it is not much of an additional chore
Sep 17 10:55:29 <fling>	dd is the plan
Sep 17 10:56:05 <ratrace>	wath out for duplicate uuids if you dd filesystems around
Sep 17 10:56:08 <ratrace>	 /watch/
Sep 17 10:56:22 <fling>	right
Sep 17 10:57:41 <mark4>	why is it wgetpaste foo [enter] keeps telling me "apparantly nothing was received"

Sep 17 10:58:40 <mark4>	http://dpaste.com/1JRTGXP

Sep 17 10:58:53 <mark4>	oopts wrong chan on that paste

Sep 17 10:59:12 <doc235>	#gentoo-wine
Sep 17 10:59:22 <xantoz>	I have problems emerging python packages. it seems the python2.7 part of them
Sep 17 11:04:10 <xantoz>	it mentions not finding pbr.pbr_json
Sep 17 11:04:38 <xantoz>	build.log: https://0x0.st/zy0X.log
Sep 17 11:05:53 <xantoz>	now dev-python/pbr is not installed, but I have other machines that don't exhibit this problem and also don't have dev-python/pbr
Sep 17 11:12:21 <xantoz>	fling: one more thing to be aware of with luks2 (not sure of relevant for you, though) is that GRUB2 does not support it
Sep 17 11:12:29 <xantoz>	I was once bitten by that, anyway
Sep 17 11:12:44 <xantoz>	but that's only relevant if you have encrypted /boot
Sep 17 11:15:49 <xantoz>	fixed my problem: seems like I had pbr installed manually using pip somehow? (very old install, god knows what horrible things I've done to this machine in the past)
Sep 17 11:15:58 <xantoz>	removing that and any pbr.json files in /usr/lib64/python2.7 seems to have fixed it
Sep 17 11:37:30 <u0_a416>	what is better rofi or dmenu
Sep 17 11:40:04 <BtbN>	I never heard either of those names. What are they?
Sep 17 11:41:07 <ratrace>	u0_a416: you'll have to define "better", rofi is doing more
Sep 17 11:45:04 <Kelsar>	BtbN: app starter menus
Sep 17 11:52:02 <twnqx>	i just got "Error: modules-load is the name of a real and virtual service." when modifying services on one of my machines
Sep 17 11:52:06 <twnqx>	how would i correct that?
Sep 17 12:04:03 <fling>	/init: line 11: can't create /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug: nonexistent directory
Sep 17 12:04:17 <fling>	don't I need mdev with recent kernels?
Sep 17 12:08:28 <rafspiny-work>	Hi there. I created a virtualenv with `virtualenv --python=python2 venv2` and then activated it. After sourced, which pip gives me /usr/bin/pip I did not find anything related on the forum. Is there anybody with the same problem?
Sep 17 12:11:08 <acidfreeze>	I am trying to cross compile 3.18.22, when I run make I keep getting fatal error: linux/compiler-gcc8.h: No such file or directory . I already downgraded from gcc9 to Gcc8 so far. this is command I am using to build
Sep 17 12:11:08 <acidfreeze>	ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabi- make
Sep 17 12:12:29 <acidfreeze>	one thing I notice is lack of /usr/armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabi/gcc-bin
Sep 17 12:12:50 <acidfreeze>	does that not exists in arm like it does in /usr//usr/armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabi/?
Sep 17 12:12:52 <sharp15>	anyone know if its currently possible to install the nvidia-drivers and the nouveau driver side-by-side?  also in kernel or x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau for the driver?  the wiki page wasn't much help on either.
Sep 17 12:13:16 <Mad3>	as long as you blacklist one of them at a time
Sep 17 12:13:25 <Mad3>	no problem building/installing it
Sep 17 12:13:33 <doc235>	no you can't sharp15
Sep 17 12:13:46 <sharp15>	Mad3: was that directed at me?
Sep 17 12:13:50 <Mad3>	yep
Sep 17 12:13:53 <sharp15>	ok.
Sep 17 12:13:59 <Mad3>	you can have both installed, but not use them at the same time
Sep 17 12:14:05 <Mad3>	one implementation has to be blacklisted
Sep 17 12:14:08 <Triffid_Hunter>	acidfreeze: why do you have a dash on the end of your target spec?
Sep 17 12:14:38 <doc235>	i had to blacklist nvidia drivers and went to nuevoue
Sep 17 12:14:40 <sharp15>	so those drivers haven't reached a real-time switch capability.
Sep 17 12:15:20 <BtbN>	sharp15, you have to pick either of the two. A piece of hardware cannot be run by two drivers at the same time.
Sep 17 12:15:21 <Mad3>	sharp15: i wonder if you're thinking of something else
Sep 17 12:15:36 <Mad3>	sharp15: because there's been some new developments around optimus
Sep 17 12:15:37 <sharp15>	ok.  ty.  i'm just trying to make sure that switching won't require multiple kernel recompiles.
Sep 17 12:15:56 <Mad3>	but if it's just kernel you're worried about, it's no deal
Sep 17 12:16:04 <BtbN>	If you have the binary nvidia driver setup already, there is little reason to switch to nouveau.
Sep 17 12:16:12 <Mad3>	it supports having both at the same time if it's just /lib/modules you're worried about
Sep 17 12:16:43 <acidfreeze>	Tiffid_Hunter: before I was using that and it was working,  I have rebuild toolchain since.
Sep 17 12:16:44 <Triffid_Hunter>	sharp15: nope, just kill X, rmmod, lsmod, start X
Sep 17 12:16:57 <acidfreeze>	thanks for that, but now I am getting ash: armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabigcc: command not found
Sep 17 12:17:26 <acidfreeze>	which I guess I might need ia32-libs
Sep 17 12:18:23 <Triffid_Hunter>	acidfreeze: I don't have any compiler-gcc anything.h on my computer, what wants it?
Sep 17 12:18:25 <acidfreeze>	but check this out, CodeSourcery convention is to use prefix arm-none-linux-gnueabi- for all executables, not gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi that you mention. So, standard name for CodeSourcery gcc would be arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc.
Sep 17 12:19:37 <sharp15>	i'm contemplating switching from nvidia-drivers to nouveau on an Optimus laptop (NVIDIA Corporation GK208M [GeForce GT 740M]) because of some recent issues with the binaries.  the render offload still doesn't work.  i was hoping the oss driver was having fewer issues.  output here http://dpaste.com/2BKWE9
Sep 17 12:20:28 <BtbN>	sharp15, the binary driver added full dynamic optimus support not even two weeks ago.
Sep 17 12:20:44 <sharp15>	i've switched to the 17.1 desktop gentoo profile and still receive the dpaste output.  its improved.  the driver stopped seg faulting.
Sep 17 12:21:03 <BtbN>	That link does not exist
Sep 17 12:21:07 <sharp15>	BtbN: that would be when the binary driver stopped functioning.
Sep 17 12:21:19 <sharp15>	*stopped functioning on my machine.
Sep 17 12:21:21 <BtbN>	Are you using bumblebee or something?
Sep 17 12:21:51 <sharp15>	BtbN: its installed.  i've just upgraded for years.  did i miss a change i needed to make?
Sep 17 12:22:03 <BtbN>	Bumblebee is just as dead as a project gets.
Sep 17 12:22:06 <acidfreeze>	Triffid_hunter: this might where that is coming from in kernel makefile
Sep 17 12:22:10 <acidfreeze>	CC              = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
Sep 17 12:22:17 <BtbN>	And nvidia dropping support for non-glvnd OpenGL killed it entirely.
Sep 17 12:23:05 <BtbN>	Your best bet probably is to mess with the new propper render offloading nvidia implemented. But you will have to patch Xorg for that to work at the moment.
Sep 17 12:23:29 <Triffid_Hunter>	acidfreeze: ah, I guess CROSS_COMPILE does want a trailing hyphen then, I usually use whatever the make equivalent of bash's ${parameter:+"$parameter"-} would be
Sep 17 12:23:29 <BtbN>	http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.21/README/primerenderoffload.html
Sep 17 12:24:14 <BtbN>	If you put the 5 commits they list into the xorg user patches dir, it will work. They have no particular order from what I can see
Sep 17 12:24:31 <sharp15>	BtbN: thats what people keep telling me about bumblebee but when removed the 3D rendering stopped working.  also not sure what glvnd is.
Sep 17 12:24:42 <acidfreeze>	yea, but getting error include/linux/compiler-gcc.h:106:1: fatal error: linux/compiler-gcc8.h: No such file or directory
Sep 17 12:24:42 <acidfreeze>	when I use it.
Sep 17 12:25:10 <grawity>	hmm so __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 is like DRI_PRIME=1 except not?
Sep 17 12:25:18 <BtbN>	sharp15, OpenGL multi-vendor support with runtime switching. It's a thing since a good 5 years now. But since Bumblebee is not developed anymore since at least 7 years, it pre-dates that.
Sep 17 12:25:31 <acidfreeze>	gcc version 8.2.0 (Gentoo 8.2.0-r6 p1.7)
Sep 17 12:25:39 <BtbN>	grawity, pretty much, yes. It's a bit more clunky than DRI_PRIME, but ultimately achives the same thing.
Sep 17 12:26:35 <BtbN>	grawity, it relies on glvnd to work.
Sep 17 12:27:47 <BtbN>	With GLVND in place, there is only one single system wide OpenGL implementation, that dynamically redirects calls to a specific vendor. Which is also why it breaks Bumblebee. Bumblebee will suddenly also send its GL calls to the Intel GPU, which causes chaos for obvious reasons.
Sep 17 12:28:16 <Fersure>	Hey guys, do you offer gentoo vhosts?
Sep 17 12:28:23 <grawity>	define 'vhost'
Sep 17 12:28:36 <BtbN>	Gentoo is not a server hosting company, no.
Sep 17 12:29:00 <Triffid_Hunter>	Fersure: gentoo does not offer servers. several VPS providers have gentoo images if you want a gentoo server though
Sep 17 12:29:06 <Fersure>	grawity: so something like gentoo/user/fersure
Sep 17 12:29:26 <BtbN>	Oh you mean the Freenode vhost. Not that I'm aware of, no.
Sep 17 12:29:34 <Fersure>	Triffid_Hunter: I run a Gentoo VPS already :D
Sep 17 12:29:37 <grawity>	not for users, afaik
Sep 17 12:29:45 <Fersure>	Ah, okay. Fair enough.
Sep 17 12:29:50 <grawity>	although some *do* have a gentoo/user/ host
Sep 17 12:30:43 <Fersure>	Well, if some friendly GC from here is willing to allow me one, I'd be grateful.
Sep 17 12:30:48 <Fersure>	If not it's not the end of the world.
Sep 17 12:34:39 <sharp15>	to check my comprehension.  Optimus should work without bumblebee/optirun (dead project).  primus/primusrun should work.  new patches in nvidia-drivers enable a better method but xorg-server hasn't updated to include the relevant capabilities yet.  do i still need virtualgl, or was that part of bumblebee?
Sep 17 12:44:10 <BtbN>	primusrun is also just a bumblebee thing, equally dead
Sep 17 12:44:38 <BtbN>	They all rely on virtualgl to pipe OpenGL calls over a TCP connection. It's horribly inefficient really.
Sep 17 12:44:47 <johntheclam>	Hi im on a fresh gentoo install and while "systemctl start gdm" works fine, if I add it to boot with "systemctl enable gdm" wont work... Any ideas on what might be causing this?
Sep 17 12:44:58 <BtbN>	Just setup the new method, it's super easy on Gentoo since you can just manually pull the patches.
Sep 17 12:45:10 <BtbN>	Or wait for the next Xorg point release if you are patient.
Sep 17 12:46:10 <josef64>	sharp15: You probably need then unmasking the libglvnd USE flag, it is not ready yet, see https://bugs.gentoo.org/692206
Sep 17 13:19:29 <sharp15>	after some continued reading.  i'll just wait for xorg-server to push its update.
Sep 17 13:20:47 <sharp15>	ty to those who commented.
Sep 17 13:44:43 <acidfreeze>	all when compiling kernel 3.18.79 I am getting error. tmp/ccMiUsAa.s: Assembler messages: /tmp/ccMiUsAa.s:3588: Error: .err encountered. Is this because I am using gcc8?  http://dpaste.com/3W8MQ36
Sep 17 13:45:14 <acidfreeze>	i thought I was supposed to use older gcc,
Sep 17 13:49:58 <fling>	what is this about in dmesg? -> Installing knfsd (copyright (C) 1996 okir@monad.swb.de).
Sep 17 13:50:53 <josef__k>	How does one tell which packages actually depend on Python 2.7? I'd love to just get rid of it if possible.
Sep 17 13:57:34 <username234>	acidfreeze: I don't see that version in the repo
Sep 17 13:58:08 <BtbN>	josef__k, depclean it
Sep 17 13:59:46 <username234>	fling: my guess is knfsd is BSD licensed.
Sep 17 14:05:23 <acidfreeze>	username234: yea, I found it https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/snapshot/.
Sep 17 14:06:02 <acidfreeze>	so if I was to find pretty close version in repo, you think I could pull off using modules for usb tethering, on device running 3.18.79
Sep 17 14:29:24 <iamben>	josef__k: try setting a new PYTHON_TARGETS with it disabled, then do a full deep world upgrade and see what complains
Sep 17 14:35:41 <dacencora>	hey guys
Sep 17 14:37:20 <dacencora>	if I wanted to switch from ~amd64 back to stable amd64, would I be in risk of breaking anything? I was reading old forums and they said that it would likely break the system due to downgrading glibc, is this still true?
Sep 17 14:37:44 <DrEeevil>	yes
Sep 17 14:37:53 <doc235>	don't downgrade glibc. it WILL break your system
Sep 17 14:38:01 <DrEeevil>	so you'd pretty much add exceptions for all installed packages and wait for versions to catch up
Sep 17 14:40:01 <dacencora>	I see. So if I were to add ~amd64 to my package.keywords for all my installed packages, wouldn't they still upgrade on updates?
Sep 17 14:40:16 <dacencora>	as in when using 'emerge --update'
Sep 17 14:40:31 <iamben>	you can start by just adding an exception in p.a_k for glibc itself
Sep 17 14:40:39 <iamben>	MOST packages can be downgraded safely
Sep 17 14:46:02 <HowardPremise>	If my kernels can't see my root partition on kernel boot and I get the PartUUID not found error, and my fstab uses UUID, how do I fix this? About to run genkernel, and I can't remember if genkernel settings can make the system "see" partitions by UUID on kernel boot.
Sep 17 14:48:06 <grknight>	HowardPremise: kernels do not know about UUIDs on file systems (root=UUID=) without an initramfs.  they can parse most PARTUUIDs so long as they can see the device and have the partition type support
Sep 17 14:49:07 <grknight>	fstab has nothing to do with kernels initially though some initramfs might use them
Sep 17 14:49:41 <HowardPremise>	I think the initramfs is how I solved it before. But, then I apparently forgot what I did.
Sep 17 14:50:13 <iamben>	so are you using root=UUID or root=PARTUUID ?
Sep 17 14:50:39 <HowardPremise>	If it doesn't work first time, I just need to generate a new initramfs, right? Or, do I have to run genkernel all over again?
Sep 17 14:50:55 <HowardPremise>	I will check my genkernel config, brb
Sep 17 14:51:02 <iamben>	this isnt in your gk config
Sep 17 14:52:50 <HowardPremise>	How do I check that, then? That's the only place I know to check.
Sep 17 14:53:18 <HowardPremise>	I am not particularly knowledgeable, so I appreciate this.
Sep 17 14:53:51 <grknight>	HowardPremise: we are asking about the bootloader config, often grub
Sep 17 14:55:10 <HowardPremise>	In my grub.cfg, it's using root=UUID.
Sep 17 14:55:42 <grknight>	and it has a initramfs listed right after it?
Sep 17 14:56:04 <HowardPremise>	It does, yes.
Sep 17 14:56:52 <grknight>	so you have UUID support.  but, for some reason, both the kernel and initramfs cannot see the device it refers to.  this could be as simple as a missing driver or, at worst, bad hardware
Sep 17 14:58:05 <grknight>	or if it is a complex device (lvm/luks/md/etc), a missing option to include/activate support
Sep 17 14:59:33 <HowardPremise>	It's emmc internal storage on a netbook.
Sep 17 14:59:52 <grknight>	did you adjust genkernel's config to support it?
Sep 17 15:00:24 <HowardPremise>	Using root= and real_root= ?
Sep 17 15:00:40 <grknight>	i mean: genkernel --menuconfig all
Sep 17 15:01:15 <grknight>	afaik, the defaults may not support eMMC devices at all
Sep 17 15:02:29 <HowardPremise>	So I'll have to go through menuconfig to get it to work? No point in using genkernel, then. I was hoping to use genkernel to be booting into the system sooner.
Sep 17 15:03:34 <grknight>	so you'll give up on changing one option to start from scratch.. sounds like a waste of time
Sep 17 15:03:41 <iamben>	genkernel supports most common hardware but it doesn't enable EVERY driver, nor does it autoconfig in any way
Sep 17 15:07:54 <HowardPremise>	grknight: I won't know whether I only need to set a few emmc options, or if I will need to set more, so what I meant is it will be trial and error same as starting from scratch. I've had somewhat working kernels before, but with errors in kernel boot. Couldn't even tell that those errors had an effect, but, different topic.
Sep 17 15:09:10 <HowardPremise>	iamben: that's where I was wrong, I thought genkernel did some kind of autoconfig.
Sep 17 15:09:39 <iamben>	it selects a LOT more drivers than the default config, and loads quite a lot of them via initramfs, but there really isnt any "smarts" to it
Sep 17 15:10:43 <iamben>	it does select a bunch of mmc stuff by default but it might be missing yours.  i'd drop to a rescue shell when boot fails, and poke around
Sep 17 15:11:44 <grknight>	if the device does show up in the rescue shell, then you may just need a few second delay for the mmc device to be found async
Sep 17 15:11:59 <grknight>	otherwise it will be a driver issue
Sep 17 15:12:46 <HowardPremise>	How do I know if it shows up in the rescue shell?
Sep 17 15:13:43 <grawity>	by running `ls /dev` in the rescue shell?
Sep 17 15:14:04 <grknight>	or reading the dmesg
Sep 17 15:14:51 *	ChanServ gives voice to rich0
Sep 17 15:15:48 <HowardPremise>	grknight: do I add that delay when creating the initramfs?
Sep 17 15:16:42 <grknight>	no, to grub config
Sep 17 15:19:06 <HowardPremise>	Found something interesting:  submenu 'Advanced options for Gentoo GNU/Linux' $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-advanced-PARTUUID=6c044e98-3034-4f26-b623-445a62099530' {
Sep 17 15:19:27 <grknight>	not interesting at all
Sep 17 15:19:29 <HowardPremise>	That string is the UUID, not the PARTUUID
Sep 17 15:19:43 <grknight>	how did it get there?
Sep 17 15:19:55 <HowardPremise>	I wish I could tell you that.
Sep 17 15:20:27 <grknight>	do you have os-prober installed?
Sep 17 15:21:28 <grknight>	but it's just a submenu.  it won't affect booting
Sep 17 15:21:48 <HowardPremise>	Okay, thought I should mention it.
Sep 17 15:22:02 <HowardPremise>	Looks like I don't have os-prober installed.
Sep 17 15:22:53 <grknight>	that's fine
Sep 17 15:23:01 <iamben>	did you check to see if /dev/mmc* exist in the rescue shell?
Sep 17 15:23:45 <HowardPremise>	I'm chrooted on the laptop in question.
Sep 17 15:24:07 <iamben>	guess we'll never know then
Sep 17 15:25:01 <iamben>	HowardPremise: while you're on a livecd, can you share "lspci -k" output?
Sep 17 15:27:30 <HowardPremise>	http://dpaste.com/2E29SQ8
Sep 17 15:28:27 <iamben>	HowardPremise: how about dmesg output too?
Sep 17 15:30:05 <HowardPremise>	http://dpaste.com/3CGM4PP
Sep 17 15:32:13 <iamben>	looks like maybe CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_ACPI is what you need
Sep 17 15:32:54 <iamben>	afk for a few
Sep 17 15:34:03 <gwapzam>	exit
Sep 17 15:35:46 <HowardPremise>	I will go back through my info before asking about kernel modules/drivers, that's another topic.
Sep 17 15:37:23 <CMoH>	hey. is there a help page on how to transition from vixie-cron to cronie? i don't understand what to do about cron.hourly and run-crons - cronie seems to recommend both emptying /etc/crontab, and running anacron with /etc/crontab. /etc/cron.hourly does contain a '0anacron' script
Sep 17 15:37:47 <CMoH>	it appears cron.daily, weekly and monthly are taken over by anacron
Sep 17 15:41:08 <HowardPremise>	grknight + iamben: Earlier when I said there is no point in running genkernel, I wasn't trying to respond with snark at all. There was a reason. Text doesn't convey tone, so please don't think I was responding with a bad attitude.
Sep 17 15:41:55 <HowardPremise>	I was going to run genkernel before going through menuconfig.
Sep 17 15:46:04 <grknight>	CMoH: yes that's the default with the anacron USE.  you can disable the USE to be more like vixie.. or simply reject the changes if you want the anacron functionality
Sep 17 15:51:24 <HowardPremise>	Did something bad happen before I asked about the PARTUUID problem? I didn't intend to cause a problem asking for help, and didn't intend to convey negativity at any time.
Sep 17 15:53:21 <HowardPremise>	If someone stressed anyone out before I showed up, please remember to many of us you people who help us are like warm, glowing jedi.
Sep 17 15:54:38 <iamben>	HowardPremise: i just wanted to clarify what genkernel can and cannot be expected to do, no problem here
Sep 17 15:55:15 <HowardPremise>	Your knowledge makes babies stop crying, and it makes food taste better, and crops grow at an accelerated rate.
Sep 17 15:55:44 <surfaceflinger>	udevd[18911]: Error changing net interface name eth0 to eth85: No such device udevd[18911]: could not rename netif to 'eth85' for collision avoidance
Sep 17 15:55:50 <surfaceflinger>	What is it trying to do? ^
Sep 17 15:56:15 <iamben>	HowardPremise: im looking now and i *think* genkernel may not be building the sdhci-acpi driver by default
Sep 17 15:56:50 <iamben>	it's in modules_load but not in any of the default configs i can see
Sep 17 15:57:50 <iamben>	surfaceflinger: do you have a custom rule that's setting that eth85?
Sep 17 15:58:33 <surfaceflinger>	iamben: no
Sep 17 15:58:44 <iamben>	surfaceflinger: can you share your full dmesg output?
Sep 17 15:59:31 <HowardPremise>	grknight + iamben: And I wasn't asking about possible stress or negativity to push you to be emotionless and non-human. It was to lead up to stating that you are positively awesome for helping people here, and people are incredibly fond of you for it.
Sep 17 16:09:12 <HowardPremise>	iamben: I'm on the way to finding the right combination of required modules+drivers, but there is either something I add or don't add that causes a problem. I think it's something I add, but that's a whole other set of questions. I was just checking to see if there was a quick and easy answer to the partUUID thing, because as I said, I fixed it
Sep 17 16:09:13 <HowardPremise>	before but completely forgot what I did. It was something so simple, I didn
Sep 17 16:09:30 <HowardPremise>	didn't even make not of it, apparently.
Sep 17 16:09:37 <HowardPremise>	note*
Sep 17 16:09:39 <Illya>	I have a few raspberry pi zero devices (rpi0) which I'm connecting to my PC via USB OTG gadgets. They show up on my PC as extra network devices. This is how I setup (one) manually https://0x0.st/zyDb.txt Is there a way I can add a list of hotpluggable network devices to a bridge network device so that I can put all the rpi0s on the same subnet?
Sep 17 16:12:19 <CMoH>	grknight, thanks - getting the hint that there are two separate ways of using the system unlocked my thoughts
Sep 17 16:17:30 <phiwer>	I am having some difficulties with my UEFI configuration (fresh install of Gentoo), and my legacy dual-boot legacy BIOS installation. Maybe I am asking for problems using UEFI with a BIOS installation on the side? It certainly seems that way.
Sep 17 16:18:13 <iamben>	phiwer: do you pick one or the other from the UEFI boot menu?
Sep 17 16:19:05 <phiwer>	Long story short: Grub2 installation on my debian/win10 harddrive can boot Gentoo, Debian and Win10. My grub2 UEFI installation on second harddrive now boots into grub2 menu, but it cannot find the kernel (nor can't boot win10; I don't remember the error code, but that OS is not important :) ).
Sep 17 16:20:23 <iamben>	uefi grub won't be able to boot a bios windows
Sep 17 16:20:45 <phiwer>	iamben: If I boot gentoo harddrive (GPT) from boot menu during startup (specifically marked UEFI), then I can load grub, but it won't boot gentoo. Complaining that it can't find the kernel. I've checked UUID in grub.cfg, and they look OK.
Sep 17 16:20:46 <iamben>	you're locked into either UEFI or BIOS mode by the time the bootloader is running
Sep 17 16:21:20 <phiwer>	Ok, that would explain why I can't boot windows, but why can't I boot gentoo?
Sep 17 16:21:23 <iamben>	maybe you can drop to a grub shell and see what the disk layout looks like
Sep 17 16:21:48 <iamben>	especially to see if the disks you need are visible at all
Sep 17 16:21:56 <phiwer>	Yeah I'll need to do that. I just wanted to figure out if I should dump this UEFI business all together (never really worked for me tbh)...
Sep 17 16:22:57 <iamben>	well i dont see any indication that UEFI is to blame yet, but mixing BIOS/UEFI OSes on the same machine is just asking for trouble
Sep 17 16:23:24 <iamben>	i prefer UEFI but if i already had BIOS windows + BIOS debian installed, i'd stick with BIOS for the new gentoo as well
Sep 17 16:23:25 <phiwer>	Yeah that's what I'm thinking as well, after having read some horror stories.
Sep 17 16:23:49 <phiwer>	Yes, that was my thinking as well. I prefer UEFI. But not sure if it's worth the trouble right now.
Sep 17 16:26:36 <grawity>	mixing BIOS and UEFI OSes is a bad idea, but regardless, it *should* technically work
Sep 17 16:29:26 <phiwer>	It seems more trouble than it's worth from what I've read. It's not a must for me to have UEFI right now.
Sep 17 16:29:41 <phiwer>	When running dual distros, is it recommended to share /boot partition?
Sep 17 16:30:55 <iamben>	i think that's just personal preference, but i would expect grub-mkconfig to get somewhat confused if you have multiple distros in one /boot
Sep 17 16:31:46 <fling>	I see no hashspec for luks2, is not it used there?
Sep 17 16:31:53 <fling>	in luksdump ^
Sep 17 16:34:48 <grawity>	I'm not sure whether the hash spec is for the cipher IV or for the password KDF
Sep 17 16:35:20 <grawity>	but in the former case, it doesn't apply to the usual default aes-xts-plain64 mode, and in the latter case, it doesn't apply to the luks2 default Argon KDF
Sep 17 16:35:26 <grawity>	as far as the manual tells me
Sep 17 16:40:42 <fling>	grawity: it is listed as hash under digests section
Sep 17 17:20:12 <Illya>	How can I run `ip link set enp4s0u1 master br0` after enp4s0u1 is automatically started by rc_hotplug="net.enp4s0u1"?
Sep 17 17:22:56 <rej>	Illya: openrc should have proper bridge support included.
Sep 17 17:23:59 <Illya>	it doesn't work if the bridge slaves don't exist when the bridge is started
Sep 17 17:24:17 <Illya>	my bridge slaves are all hotplugged interfaces
Sep 17 17:24:59 <iamben>	surely enp4s0u1 exists due to the kernel+udev, not net.enp4s0u1 being started
Sep 17 17:25:49 <Illya>	the network card is not plugged in on boot when the bridge starts
Sep 17 17:26:13 <iamben>	then i dont think you can start the bridge on boot
Sep 17 17:26:33 <iamben>	i dont think we're on the same page yet
Sep 17 17:27:43 <grknight>	Illya: netifrc doesn't support hotplugging to bridges (or vlans or things like that).  you can fake it with a postup script, but that may be buggie
Sep 17 17:31:15 <Illya>	ah postup is exactly what I wanted. Now bridge starts at boot with no slaves. All slave interfaces are added to rc_hotplug and have a postup() adding them to the bridge.
Sep 17 17:31:23 <Illya>	thanks that works
Sep 17 17:33:18 <grknight>	Illya: you know you can use netplug or ifplugd instead of relying on rc_hotplug for network devices
Sep 17 17:34:19 <mark4>	so im at work and one of the products here is having certain issues and i know they have their optimization level set to -O3 which someone in here a while back told me could be problematical, can someone explain to me why setting -O3 might not be a good idea?
Sep 17 17:34:26 <mark4>	p.s. my make.conf is -O2
Sep 17 17:34:41 <grknight>	Illya: actually, that might be a bad idea if it is already working
Sep 17 17:34:45 <Illya>	I tried both and couldn't get them to work. Also weird thing is `br0: <NO-CARRIER` but it all works anyway so this is just reporting wrong here
Sep 17 17:34:46 <rej>	grknight: Both are quite old now, and rc_hotplug should be able to do that, too.
Sep 17 17:40:39 <iamben>	mark4: O3 is more likely to expose bugs in your code, especially when relying on undefined behavior.  but it's also true that it can make quite a bit of code run *slower* than it would have with -O2.  those are reasons we recommend global O2, but it doesn't mean that O3 is inherently broken or bad
Sep 17 17:48:41 <mark4>	iamben ty for that answer, i had found the same answer elsewhere too.
Sep 17 17:52:22 <x42>	I need to install an unstable version of aqbanking, which depends on other unstable packages and on qt4. Is there a "good" way to do this?
Sep 17 17:54:21 <iamben>	x42: what version of aqbanking is this? i only see one version in ::gentoo and it doesn't use qt at all
Sep 17 17:54:39 <generic>	anyone here tried protonvpn using gentoo ?
Sep 17 17:54:41 <x42>	true it is not yet in the gentoo tree
Sep 17 17:55:05 <iamben>	there's a *newer* version than what ::gentoo has, but it uses qt4?
Sep 17 17:55:36 <iamben>	or you have to go back to some ancient version for some reason?
Sep 17 17:56:30 <x42>	as far as i understand it uses a dependency which uses qt4
Sep 17 17:56:33 <x42>	i need libaqbanking/5.8.2-0.1
Sep 17 17:56:44 <x42>	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=934905
Sep 17 17:57:19 <x42>	(in facte very hbci users in europe needs it)
Sep 17 17:58:10 <generic>	x42: whats hbci ?
Sep 17 17:58:48 <x42>	home banking computer interfac ... e.g. downloading your banking transaction to your computer
Sep 17 17:59:07 <iamben>	i see some usage of qt3 in the source
Sep 17 17:59:19 <x42>	absolutly common in europe ... but there is a new law in affect since a week which enforces a "strong" authentication method
Sep 17 17:59:30 <x42>	which is only implemente in the new aqbanking version
Sep 17 17:59:54 <iamben>	it's new but they used qt4 and/or qt3?
Sep 17 18:00:00 <x42>	i tried to install it manually, but gave up after i saw the dependency of qt4
Sep 17 18:00:38 <iamben>	isnt there a gtk frontend you can use instead?
Sep 17 18:01:11 <x42>	gwenhywfar is a dependency which depends on qt4 as far as i understand
Sep 17 18:01:22 <x42>	the frontend depends on aqbanking
Sep 17 18:01:29 <x42>	e.g. gnucash
Sep 17 18:01:44 <iamben>	on gentoo it uses the gtk frontend & gwenhywfar features
Sep 17 18:02:05 <grawity>	gwenhywfar 4.20.2 on arch depends on gtk3/qt5
Sep 17 18:02:15 <x42>	interesting
Sep 17 18:02:37 <grawity>	no patches, just --with-guis="gtk3 qt5" https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/gwenhywfar
Sep 17 18:02:51 <iamben>	for now ours uses gtk2 only
Sep 17 18:03:17 <x42>	@grawity so you mean i could manually install it without qt?
Sep 17 18:04:06 <iamben>	sounds like you just need to version-bump the gentoo ebuild?
Sep 17 18:04:16 <iamben>	and keep gtk2 support as it is
Sep 17 18:10:08 <generic>	i wanna run some vpn on my nat machine
Sep 17 18:10:22 <generic>	doesnt have to be a ton of bandwith
Sep 17 18:10:27 <generic>	but has to be free
Sep 17 18:11:47 <generic>	protonvpn is not great in terms of config :(
Sep 17 18:12:25 <x42>	@iamben what do you mean by "version-bump" the gentoo ebuild?
Sep 17 18:12:55 <x42>	i know how to install unstable packages, but this package is not even in the protage tree
Sep 17 18:13:05 <redsh>	"free"? So, what, you want a commercial VPN provider rather than to connect to hosts you control?
Sep 17 18:13:22 <iamben>	x42: well you can add a new version of the ebuild to your local overlay, many version bumps are as simple as copying the existing ebuild to a new filename
Sep 17 18:13:44 <generic>	redsh i just wanna anonymize my traffic
Sep 17 18:14:01 <x42>	ok i'll dive/think about that ... thanks iamben!
Sep 17 18:14:01 <iamben>	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Portage/CustomTree#Defining_a_custom_repository https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Custom_repository#Simple_version_bump_of_an_ebuild_in_the_local_repository
Sep 17 18:14:10 <x42>	thanks!!
Sep 17 18:15:34 <generic>	redsh is there even a net-vpn branch in portage ?
Sep 17 18:16:18 <redsh>	I'd argue that having a different source IP address doesn't really do much nowadays...
Sep 17 18:16:21 <redsh>	generic: Yes?
Sep 17 18:16:33 <generic>	redsh, just saw it
Sep 17 18:17:37 <iamben>	generic: what is your "nat machine", a home router? or some VPS hosted in a datacenter offsite somewhere?
Sep 17 18:17:51 <generic>	 want some cookies redsh ?
Sep 17 18:18:12 <generic>	iamben, just my gentoo box with wifi
Sep 17 18:19:14 <generic>	iamben, Ive tried using protonvpn app on my android phonne but it behaves funny
Sep 17 18:19:24 <generic>	iamben, sometimes working sometimes not
Sep 17 18:20:01 <generic>	iamben, ^then tether from android phone to nat box
Sep 17 18:21:40 <zxcat>	Hi all. Question: what is the difference between SSL and LibreSSL ? Question2: Can we use both?
Sep 17 18:22:19 <kerframil>	are you confusing SSL with the implemenation known as OpenSSL?
Sep 17 18:22:52 <iamben>	generic: nat box isnt usually a router, only sometimes?
Sep 17 18:22:56 <zxcat>	kerframil: I guess I do
Sep 17 18:23:33 <grawity>	SSL (now known as TLS) is the protocol itself;  OpenSSL/LibreSSL/GnuTLS are popular implementations of this protocol (libraries)
Sep 17 18:23:35 <zxcat>	both are used for secure connections, right?
Sep 17 18:24:06 <kerframil>	zxcat: both are libraries that implement TLS (transport layer security). LibreSSL is OpenBSD's fork. both cannot be installed at the same time. some packages are broken with LibreSSL, though work is ongoing in gentoo to rectify any such cases as they arise.
Sep 17 18:24:33 <zxcat>	<3
Sep 17 18:24:58 <generic>	iamben, the rndis interface presented from phone is kind o whack. sometimes enabling tethering then vpn works ... but only sometimes
Sep 17 18:25:13 <iamben>	generic: you're not being even close to clear about what you're trying to accopmlish
Sep 17 18:25:13 <generic>	iamben, havent checked the traffic so far either
Sep 17 18:25:42 <iamben>	are you looking for a 3rd party vpn provider? or a vpn server package to emerge on your gentoo?
Sep 17 18:25:46 <generic>	iamben, connect to protonvpn server from gentoo box instead of android phone basically
Sep 17 18:25:56 <generic>	iamben, 3rd party
Sep 17 18:26:11 <iamben>	so you need a vpn client on gentoo that connects to someone else's protovpn server?
Sep 17 18:26:39 <generic>	iamben, client is the problem ... servers are free
Sep 17 18:26:48 <iamben>	so "yes" ?
Sep 17 18:26:55 <generic>	iamben, config is quite a hassle
Sep 17 18:27:00 <generic>	iamben, yes
Sep 17 18:27:28 <iamben>	generic: ok now you have a real question that someone can possibly answer
Sep 17 18:27:54 <iamben>	"i wanna run some vpn on my nat machine" was not
Sep 17 18:35:54 <wozencroft>	The flag ntfsdecrypt for ntfs3g does not seem to be valid anymore.
Sep 17 18:36:00 <lg188>	Hi, I've been fiddling around with getting my `/etc/conf.d/net` file working with my networks, but for some reason wpa_supplicant doesn't "enable" some
Sep 17 18:36:38 <zxcat>	I am reading about gentoo stages. Somehow I feel like stage4 will be a faster instalation, while each stage4 have no definition related to it self. So question is: what is the difference between gentoo stage3 and stage4?
Sep 17 18:36:40 <lg188>	I have to go in `wpa_cli` then `list_networks` and then `enable_network` for some APs before it connects
Sep 17 18:36:51 <iamben>	zxcat: we do not have any general purpose stage4s, officially
Sep 17 18:37:21 <iamben>	the ones you may see in a release dir on our mirrors are targetting specific openstack/cloud setups
Sep 17 18:37:32 <HuggyBear>	everytime i boot into gentoo after being in windows i get free blocks count wrong, directories count wrong and free inode count wrong on all ext4 drives
Sep 17 18:38:12 <iamben>	wozencroft: how so?
Sep 17 18:38:12 <HuggyBear>	fsck fixes the problem and there are no further errors afterwards
Sep 17 18:38:18 <zxcat>	iamben: so is not a "good idea" to use stage4 for "personal computers" right.
Sep 17 18:38:37 <HuggyBear>	but it is consistent every time i boot into win 10
Sep 17 18:38:39 <iamben>	zxcat: not any of the ones on gentoo mirrors, anyway
Sep 17 18:38:57 <zxcat>	ty  1
Sep 17 18:39:11 <HuggyBear>	ext4 filesystems i should have said
Sep 17 18:39:36 <wozencroft>	iamben: Using the other flags do work, but it shows "not valid" for ntfsdecrypt while emerging ntfs3g
Sep 17 18:39:51 <grknight>	HuggyBear: do you have some old ext driver in windows that is messing with those FS?
Sep 17 18:40:09 <HuggyBear>	grknight: i guess it's possible
Sep 17 18:40:35 <iamben>	wozencroft: what version are you emerging?
Sep 17 18:40:41 <HuggyBear>	grknight: honestly don't know if i have installed anything to deal w/ext. but i will check
Sep 17 18:41:03 <HuggyBear>	grknight: or is that something that would have been native w/win install
Sep 17 18:41:10 <grknight>	HuggyBear: you would have to explictly have done so.  there is nothing native
Sep 17 18:41:36 <HuggyBear>	grknight: ok, i will check then. it's possible that i did and just don't remember
Sep 17 18:41:48 <wozencroft>	iamben: 2017.3.23-r2
Sep 17 18:42:08 <iamben>	wozencroft: can you share the output where it says "not valid" ?
Sep 17 18:42:16 <iamben>	(it's working fine here)
Sep 17 18:42:21 <HuggyBear>	grknight: i'm not mounting them in win or would that make any difference
Sep 17 18:43:05 <lg188>	So not sure if I did wifi wrong or if something is wrong on this device. Because I can't recall changing anything since last time I used this on other networks
Sep 17 18:43:26 <HuggyBear>	grknight: would, with some ext app being installed, just 'see' them and do whatever
Sep 17 18:43:28 <grknight>	HuggyBear: nothing should be touching such FS.  if you wanted (and have the free space to do it), try a different FS like xfs
Sep 17 18:43:54 <rhombus>	How is "supported overlay" defined?
Sep 17 18:44:00 <wozencroft>	iamben: Ah, ok, maybe I do something in the wrong way: "Invalid atom in /etc/portage/package.use/ntfs: ntfsdecrypt" - the other flags there are ok
Sep 17 18:44:24 <HuggyBear>	grknight: i could change my /home to xfs
Sep 17 18:44:46 <iamben>	wozencroft: you need a package name & flag, eg "sys-fs/ntfs3g ntfsdecrypt"
Sep 17 18:45:11 <iamben>	sys-fs/ntfs3g here is the "valid atom", ntfsdecrypt isnt one
Sep 17 18:45:25 <acidfreeze>	could someone help me figure out the actual problem when I attempt to cross compile kernel 3.18.79, all that is printed is Error: .err encountered
Sep 17 18:45:37 <wozencroft>	iamben: Ouh, indeed, thank you for the hint! Silly mistake on my end...
Sep 17 18:45:46 <acidfreeze>	this is actual log, http://dpaste.com/1X2HV0N
Sep 17 18:46:00 <grknight>	rhombus: in what context?
Sep 17 18:46:13 <HuggyBear>	grknight: i wish i had another fs on one of the partitions to see if it was specific to ext4
Sep 17 18:47:11 <rhombus>	grknight: in the context of layman. In the man page, it says "layman provides the -L, --list and -l, --list-local options to print a list of available respectively installed
Sep 17 18:47:11 <rhombus>	       overlays."
Sep 17 18:47:53 <rhombus>	"Listing will prepend all fully supported overlays with a green asterisk, all non-official overlays with a yellow asterisk and all overlays that you will not be able to use since you do not have the necessary tools installed with a red asterisk.
Sep 17 18:48:17 <grknight>	rhombus: i stopped using Layman as it is obsolete (mostly);  but -L should pull from the gentoo published list while -l should only show what is known locally
Sep 17 18:48:57 <acidfreeze>	also I attempted to downgrade GCC to 8.3 and no back at 9.2.. same error
Sep 17 18:49:12 <rhombus>	grknight: My question is more about how the overlays are classified. I use -L to get the remote list.
Sep 17 18:49:22 <grknight>	but really that last part is an arbitrary designation by layman
Sep 17 18:49:47 <grknight>	and in the published list.  like user vs dev vs project
Sep 17 18:49:54 <iamben>	rhombus: there are a few "classifications" in repositories.xml, "official" vs "unofficial" where official means maintained by a gentoo project or maintainer
Sep 17 18:50:13 <iamben>	also they can declare a "quality" of stable or experimental (or maybe others)
Sep 17 18:50:20 <iamben>	i think layman "green" is official only
Sep 17 18:51:03 <rhombus>	iamben: well, there is at least one overlay marked "green" in layman where I have wonder how it could be called "supported" or even "official" :)
Sep 17 18:51:11 <rhombus>	Does anyone here know fordfrog?
Sep 17 18:51:15 <iamben>	yes, the classifications aren't perfect, i see a few mistakes as well
Sep 17 18:51:28 <grknight>	rhombus: we know that he is a gentoo dev
Sep 17 18:51:35 <rhombus>	grknight: ok
Sep 17 18:51:40 <nixi>	i am trying to set a different qt theme according to https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GTK_themes_in_Qt_applications
Sep 17 18:52:00 <nixi>	whete it's suggested to use qtconfig from the dev-qt/qt3support package
Sep 17 18:52:04 <rhombus>	grknight: his personal blog has been neglected, the last entry is from 2012 :)
Sep 17 18:52:06 <nixi>	but it does not exist
Sep 17 18:52:24 <grknight>	rhombus: one does not need a blog to be a dev
Sep 17 18:52:32 <wozencroft>	grknight: I wrote an email about the qcf certificate not-fetching-from-git issue, luckily it's fixed already (great work from the deepin maintainer!)
Sep 17 18:52:36 <rhombus>	grknight: true enough :)
Sep 17 18:53:05 <rhombus>	grknight: so is it possible that his overlay is marked supported (green) simply because he is a dev?
Sep 17 18:53:11 <grknight>	indeed
Sep 17 18:53:22 <rhombus>	ok
Sep 17 18:53:37 <rhombus>	grknight:should I stop using layman?
Sep 17 18:53:55 <rhombus>	what are the alternatives?
Sep 17 18:55:38 <iamben>	rhombus: emerge can sync most overlay types now so a simpler tool like eselect-repository can be used to pull from the global repositories.xml index to generate a repos.conf entry, that emerge can sync with
Sep 17 18:59:41 <grknight>	nixi: marked that page as outdated.  hopefully someone will fill in what's necessary
Sep 17 19:03:23 <nixi>	grknight, so how wouldi set my QT themes?
Sep 17 19:03:37 <rhombus>	 iambenok, I've installed eselect-repository. How do I use it if I want multiple overlays? Typically eselect selections are exclusive.
Sep 17 19:03:39 <nixi>	i use lxappearance for GTK
Sep 17 19:03:49 <rhombus>	 iamben: ok, I've installed eselect-repository. How do I use it if I want multiple overlays? Typically eselect selections are exclusive.
Sep 17 19:04:27 <grknight>	nixi: i generally don't change themes besides what my DE sets
Sep 17 19:04:32 <iamben>	rhombus: i think you're generalizing a bit =) in this case you can enable/disable as many things as you want
Sep 17 19:04:34 <rhombus>	ah, sorry, found the help
Sep 17 19:04:43 <grknight>	rhombus: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Eselect/Repository
Sep 17 19:04:46 <rhombus>	iamben: yeah, my mistake, sorry for the annoyance
Sep 17 19:21:54 <apurkrt>	hi there, just failed to compile 5.3.0 kernel with genkernel
Sep 17 19:22:01 <apurkrt>	"compile_external_modules() failed to compile out-of-tree-modules"
Sep 17 19:22:38 <iamben>	apurkrt: was it working on something known broken on 5.3.0, like virtualbox-modules?
Sep 17 19:23:29 <apurkrt>	iamben: bingo, you are right - looking at genkernel.log now, I see it
Sep 17 19:24:01 <apurkrt>	it really failed on virtualbox-modules
Sep 17 19:24:15 <iamben>	well at the risk of sounding preachy, you should not expect to be able to use bleeding-edge kernels like 5.3.0 when you rely on 3rd party kernel mods like vbox
Sep 17 19:24:34 <iamben>	it broke on 5.3.0, it'll probably break on 5.4.0, it'll likely break again on 5.5.0
Sep 17 19:25:43 <apurkrt>	iamben: I see
Sep 17 19:26:19 <apurkrt>	so probably simply wait for 5.3.1?
Sep 17 19:26:40 <iamben>	every time a new kernel release hits, we have a fresh wave of "nvidia doesn't build"  "zfs doesn't build"  "virtualbox-modules doesn't build"  "vmware doesn't build"  ...
Sep 17 19:26:56 <iamben>	no, you'll need to wait for a new version of virtualbox-modules that has been adjusted for 5.3 changes
Sep 17 19:27:18 <username234>	or work out the patch(ws) needed
Sep 17 19:27:23 <username234>	es*
Sep 17 19:27:35 <apurkrt>	iamben: actually, previously, I always built kernel with genkernel all
Sep 17 19:27:50 <apurkrt>	then "emerge -1 virtualbox-modules"
Sep 17 19:27:53 <grknight>	username234: good luck with that when it comes to Oracle ;)
Sep 17 19:28:03 <acidfreeze>	any help would be appreciated, need to figure out where to look for error. I have disabled all of the SOC processors except for qc. still says this error, I am not sure what to look for http://dpaste.com/163HXFD
Sep 17 19:28:24 <iamben>	apurkrt: well either way is just as likely to fail, the failure just shows up in a different log
Sep 17 19:30:40 <grawity>	apurkrt: are you using virtualbox 5.x or 6.x?
Sep 17 19:31:03 <apurkrt>	grawity: virtualbox 6.0, yes
Sep 17 19:37:59 <zxcat>	Re: Can you advice me to use a simple audio player made of command line?
Sep 17 19:38:12 <zxcat>	for*
Sep 17 19:39:09 <iamben>	zxcat: aplay, assuming your audio is all in wav format
Sep 17 19:39:30 <iamben>	if it's not, you may need something less simple
Sep 17 19:39:52 <zxcat>	then I guess I need something less simple.
Sep 17 19:40:16 <soliwilos>	zxcat: You could take a look at cmus.
Sep 17 19:40:16 <iamben>	ffplay?
Sep 17 19:40:20 <grawity>	mpv; gst-play (if you have gstreamer); paplay
Sep 17 19:40:43 <zxcat>	checking ^
Sep 17 19:40:45 <iamben>	i think you probably have more desired features than just being "simple" so there are dozens of possible answers
Sep 17 19:41:18 <zxcat>	iamben: :)
Sep 17 19:41:44 <zxcat>	what is simplicity if not a bounch of many complexities?
Sep 17 19:42:57 <zxcat>	iamben: ffplay? is that package inside ffmpeg?
Sep 17 19:43:00 <iamben>	yes
Sep 17 19:43:13 *	ChanServ gives voice to sbraz
Sep 17 19:43:47 <iamben>	that or mpv or mplayer can easily play a list of audio files from CLI, though they probably don't have library features, tag features, etc, that you may expect from a music player
Sep 17 19:47:52 <zxcat>	is ok to edit FFTOOLS="*" content?
Sep 17 19:48:07 <Illya>	cmus is great
Sep 17 19:53:19 <iamben>	zxcat: sure, you can set a new value if you don't want all those tools
Sep 17 19:58:30 <zxcat>	as all players, simplify the use to manage the original tools. for each codec flag, add those libs into it. Even mplayer ask ffmpeg. So I will start from there.
Sep 17 19:59:36 <iamben>	most modern media players will use ffmpeg on the backend
Sep 17 19:59:58 <iamben>	ffmpeg supports playback of most codecs non-optionally, those codec USE flags are generally for *encoding*
Sep 17 20:01:06 <grawity>	either that, or gstreamer
Sep 17 20:01:14 <grawity>	(...which itself also uses ffmpeg for a lot of stuff)
Sep 17 20:02:38 <zxcat>	iamben: how do you enable the "ffplay" module?
Sep 17 20:03:07 <iamben>	looks like USE=sdl toggles that
Sep 17 20:17:01 <zxcat>	hmm.. it seams like ffplay doesn't recognize a file.opus even when ffmpeg did installed opus lib, while if it is pure audio, it shouldn't give an error saying ( cannot display ) ..
Sep 17 20:18:37 <voldial>	Is there a way to ask portage for a packages SRC_URI/EGIT_REPO_URI/etc? I'm happy to do it through the API, just looking for a pointer...
Sep 17 20:18:46 <iamben>	zxcat: maybe see what ffprobe says about the file
Sep 17 20:20:35 <zxcat>	looks good. encoder Lavc58*
Sep 17 20:20:48 <zxcat>	flac
Sep 17 20:20:58 <zxcat>	ok I need flac libs
Sep 17 20:21:23 <iamben>	is there a video stream as well?
Sep 17 20:21:33 <zxcat>	no. just audio
Sep 17 20:21:42 <grawity>	"Lavc" just means it was muxed using ffmpeg, doesn't actually say what format it is
Sep 17 20:21:57 <voldial>	I see eix can search on --src-uri, reading....
Sep 17 20:22:26 <iamben>	afaik ffmpeg also decodes flac without special flags... your mention of "display" makes me think it's finding a video stream
Sep 17 20:28:53 <voldial>	what I really want is for emerge to not fail when the net is down. I want it to patiently wait for it to return.
Sep 17 20:32:27 <grknight>	voldial: emerge -pf
Sep 17 20:38:07 <voldial>	nice. that works
Sep 17 21:08:19 <acidfreeze>	why when I do crossdev -S --g 4 armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabi it says  =cross-armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabi/gcc-9.2.0 needs to be unmasked
Sep 17 21:12:42 <Jjeje>	Hello, i'm writting a python program which auto sync portage repo. I'd like to load python portage module in my program and call sync directly from there. I need some help around ? Thx
Sep 17 21:13:56 <ajak>	isn't putting `emerge --sync` in a cron job sufficient?
Sep 17 21:15:15 <Jjeje>	Maybe but i writing something more elaborate, after calling --sync, program --pretend world update (and many more)
Sep 17 21:15:38 <Jjeje>	It doing this as well for git kernel update ;)
Sep 17 21:16:01 <username234>	ajak's recommendation would be the simplest solution.
Sep 17 21:16:41 <username234>	That said, the modules you need are written in Python and can be imported via custom python scripts.
Sep 17 21:17:22 <Jjeje>	I wrote already all the git pulling stuff. I found a way to call sync directly from portage module but i don't know if it's a right way
Sep 17 21:17:28 <grknight>	Jjeje: if you really want to go nuts. look at /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/portage/emaint/modules/sync/{__init__,sync}.py for examples of how emaint does it
Sep 17 21:18:45 <Jjeje>	thx grknight will take a look, i reading already -> https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/api/module-tree.html
Sep 17 21:18:59 <Jjeje>	But it a big big piece ;)
Sep 17 21:20:08 <grknight>	Jjeje: this channel generally doesn't dive into the API.  usually that's for #gentoo-portage
Sep 17 21:20:58 <Jjeje>	ok so i should ask there ?
Sep 17 21:22:28 <grknight>	for further inquires, yes, i would recommend it
Sep 17 21:22:38 <Jjeje>	thx ;)
Sep 17 21:23:08 <ajak>	is there an easy way to check for installed reverse dependencies?
Sep 17 21:23:33 <iamben>	ajak: emerge -cpv foo    will list installed packages that depend on foo
Sep 17 21:23:52 <ajak>	thank you
Sep 17 21:35:02 <voldial>	why does repoman not like "# Copyright 1999-2019 Gentoo Foundation" http://dpaste.com/38HB47Q
Sep 17 21:36:34 <grknight>	voldial: s/Foundation/Authors/
Sep 17 21:37:04 <voldial>	grknight: ah. thanks. I'll global replace my overlay

Sep 17 21:47:06 <os360>	This doesn't look good. End of my last emerge sync shows: /usr/portage/profiles/updates/2Q-2019...
Sep 17 21:47:06 <os360>	/usr/portage/profiles/updates/3Q-2019.......

Sep 17 21:47:26 <dkjii>	hey, somehow any user on my system can do DISPLAY=:0 xterm and hijack my current user's Xorg, any idea why the xauthoriy isn't needed?
Sep 17 21:47:47 <iamben>	os360: doesn't it have some info telling what those symbols mean?

Sep 17 22:48:52 <zxcat>	nevermind. More questions: as we can use 'euse' to manipulate USE flags without editing directly package.use/* files, is possible to change accept_keywords (~) using a similar approach? ( using some portage tool )
Sep 17 22:56:00 <redsh>	Doesn't euse set global flags, like adding stuff to USE= in make.conf?
Sep 17 22:56:22 <iamben>	possibly flaggie
Sep 17 22:56:43 <iamben>	but they're just text files, you can manipulate with echo/sed/etc
