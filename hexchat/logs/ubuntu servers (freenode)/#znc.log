Aug 31 11:28:49 <Aadam>	he-man I do these and works
Aug 31 11:29:02 <Aadam>	./query *controlpanel
Aug 31 11:30:01 <Aadam>	set ident username identityIwant
Aug 31 11:30:36 <Aadam>	set realname username realnameIwant
Aug 31 11:33:00 <Aadam>	bnut you are using a free bnc by bnc providers?
Aug 31 14:51:05 <extrowerk>	Hi
Aug 31 14:51:59 <extrowerk>	A quick question: znc configured to use ssl, but now i want to disable it. i can't seem to find any way at the webadmin. How can i do that?
Aug 31 15:51:00 <Khaytsus>	Someone in another channel is saying he has utf8 issues, which I think are really his irc client or terminal...  but now that I'm looking, what is really reocmmended for the client encoding? Mine is apparently set to the default, "don't ensure any encoding" 
Aug 31 16:41:46 <LouWestin>	I use MIRC with whatever defaults and a iPhone app. 
Aug 31 16:42:01 <LouWestin>	Palaver
Aug 31 16:43:37 <Lartza>	Khaytsus, utf8, I thought this discussion ended years ago :/
Aug 31 16:44:33 <Lartza>	I think I have ZNC setup to read ISO-8859-15 aswell because ugh but I'd rather not
Aug 31 16:48:42 <Khaytsus>	I'm pretty sure his utf8 issues have nothing to do with znc.  It just make me curious what that setting should be.  It seems to default to "dont' ensure" but the second one is marked as recomended, which converts a non-utf8 string into another encoding.
Aug 31 18:39:12 <JackK>	I'm trying to set ZNC back up..  I was using an older version 1.6.something I think.  I had a pretty detailed config which I'm trying to use, rather than recreating everything.
Aug 31 18:39:42 <JackK>	I'm using ZNC 1.7.2+deb3 now..  Before I was able to list all of the networks/channels at the same time, separated by networks.  Now I have to jumpnetwork.  Any idea how to get that back?
Aug 31 18:40:00 <JackK>	so they're all displayed at the same time and I can cycle through them?
Aug 31 19:00:49 <JackK>	Aha.. it was my weechat config.
Aug 31 19:10:57 <jrmu>	can i put a reverse proxy in front of znc? to avoid having to run znc as root since port 443 is privileged
Aug 31 19:15:49 <jrmu>	ok i got it set up using relayd, nvm, thanks all
Aug 31 19:40:23 <kylef>	LouWestin: Palaver uses UTF-8, you can override it with custom encoding via /set irc.network.<name of network>.decode_charset (encode is separate option)
Aug 31 19:43:27 <kylef>	jrmu: you can also use CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to allow the process to bind to small ports 
Aug 31 19:43:53 <jrmu>	ah, I ended up using a reverse proxy
Aug 31 19:44:06 <jrmu>	CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, is that some linux specific setting? i'm running on openbsd
Aug 31 19:45:19 <kylef>	Oh right yeah, not sure what equivalent on OpenBSD will be if any 
Aug 31 19:45:38 <kylef>	There’s also identserver, was considering doing something similar in ZNC I run 
Aug 31 19:47:20 <jrmu>	ah, i ended up setting it up with oidentd
Aug 31 19:47:57 <jrmu>	i'd like to eventually use the identd that comes with openbsd, but it'll take some modding of the code
Aug 31 19:49:54 <LouWestin>	Kylef: Ok. I didn’t mess with anything 
Aug 31 20:37:32 <MrAureliusR>	heh, I just used 8080 as my port. guess I am just lazy :P

Sep 12 17:10:06 <psychon>	corner_cubicle: I would expect that you just need TLS 1.3 support in libssl and nothing special in znc
Sep 12 17:47:40 <kylef>	psychon: won't some of the logic at https://github.com/jimloco/Csocket/blob/e8d9e0bb248c521c2c7fa01e1c6a116d929c41b4/Csocket.cc#L1652 need updating?
Sep 12 17:48:05 <kylef>	I guess the default falls through and supports TLS 1.3
Sep 12 17:54:16 <psychon>	what the heck is that O.o
Sep 12 17:55:12 <psychon>	anyway, by default SSLv23_method() / TLS_method() negotiate the supported protocol version with the other end and then use the highest supported version
Sep 12 17:56:03 <psychon>	https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version.html says "Setting the minimum or maximum version to 0, will enable protocol versions down to the lowest version, or up to the highest version supported by the library, respectively."
Sep 12 17:56:12 <psychon>	and the code you linked to defaults to using 0 as the version
Sep 12 17:56:29 <psychon>	so this should be fine, but the code needs changing if one wants to force TLS 1.3

Sep 12 18:54:28 <Khaytsus>	Server is znc.... so yes
Sep 12 18:54:38 <Khaytsus>	Just like it says.
Sep 12 18:55:14 <Khaytsus>	If you pass no network at all, I think it connects to whatever the first one is.
Sep 12 18:55:35 <Khaytsus>	So..  pass the network, always...  otherwise who knows.  Maybe it's consistent, maybe not
Sep 12 19:02:09 <lightx>	ahh.. look at that, it worked
Sep 12 19:02:23 <lightx>	thanks Khaytsus 
Sep 12 20:30:07 <gencha>	can you add another allowed ip for a user from irc? or is that only possible from the web ui?

Sep 15 23:46:32 <astronavt>	is there a way to run znc irc only over a unix socket
Sep 15 23:50:38 <astronavt>	was hoping to proxy it through nginx so i dont have to mess with ssl certs in 2 places
Sep 15 23:57:46 <astronavt>	also, probably stupid question, but is there no way to use 2 different sasl logins for 2 different networks?
Sep 15 23:57:53 <astronavt>	e.g. freenode and moznet, i have totally different logins
Sep 16 00:01:02 <astronavt>	huh. looks like it's 1 znc user == 1 irc user for 1 network?
Sep 16 00:01:12 <astronavt>	so i need to make a different znc user for each irc network i want to join?
