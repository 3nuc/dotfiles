Sep 05 16:32:14 <threenuc>	I can curl my domain and it returns the correct value but if I try to connect through a browser I get a timeout after a minute or two. What's wrong here?
Sep 05 16:32:28 <azonenberg>	threenuc: browser proxy/dns settings?
Sep 05 16:32:34 <azonenberg>	ipv4 vs ipv6. one working and one not?
Sep 05 16:34:06 <threenuc>	@azonenberg, I mean other websites work fine so browser settings should be ok in regards to browser/dns settings (same with ipv4/ipv6?). I'm hosting a page on AWS S3
Sep 05 16:36:18 <azonenberg>	Packet sniff and see whats different
Sep 05 16:36:41 <detha>	to check ipv4/6 try ipv4.google.com and ipv6.google.com from the browseer, see if both work
Sep 05 16:37:23 <azonenberg>	detha: ooh google has an ipv4-only alias? did not know that
Sep 05 16:37:30 <azonenberg>	ipv6.google.com is my usual test for v6 connectivity
Sep 05 16:37:36 <azonenberg>	but for v4 i usually just ping 8.8.8.8
Sep 05 16:38:48 <detha>	they do, for when you have broken v6 connectivity (i.e. v6 pretends to work, but something goes wrong further upstream)
Sep 05 16:39:30 <azonenberg>	ah ok makes sense
Sep 05 16:39:40 <azonenberg>	and yeah i've had that happen a few times
Sep 05 16:40:03 <threenuc>	Well, ipv6.google.com is unreachable. I'll dl wireshark and see what's up when I connect though, thanks

Sep 05 17:02:25 <fly_agaric>	my dhcp server from my mikrotik router assigned a 10.0.0.0 lease to my media receiver
Sep 05 17:03:03 <fly_agaric>	i made a dhcp reservation with a fictive ip aa:bb:cc and then the dhcp server handed out a 10.0.0.2 ip which was fine
Sep 05 17:03:26 <fly_agaric>	can someone explain me why a dhcp server hands out the netid instead of a working ip?
Sep 05 17:07:16 <azonenberg>	fly_agaric: probably because the server is misconfigured? :)
Sep 05 17:09:19 <threenuc>	... i think my issue is because my domain name didn't propagate to dns servers yet
Sep 05 17:09:43 <threenuc>	somehow i thought it's instantaneous
Sep 05 17:20:45 <diverdude>	hi, lets say i want to run a website which is relying on a database. The database contains sensitive information and should be kept safe. The website however needs to run on the internet. Normally I think one would put the webserver in a DMZ to keep it away from the private network, but what about the database? Where is that put? It should be kept safe since it has sensitive information - but yet the webserver in the DMZ needs to be able to acce
Sep 05 17:20:45 <diverdude>	ss it in order to run the website - how is this normally handled?
Sep 05 17:22:47 <ne2k>	diverdude, make a threat model
Sep 05 17:25:10 <ne2k>	diverdude, my gut tells me that not a lot is going to be gained by putting anything between the webserver and the database server. but I could be wrong
Sep 05 17:25:32 <diverdude>	ne2k: a thread model?
Sep 05 17:25:41 <diverdude>	*threat model
Sep 05 17:25:43 <diverdude>	what is that
Sep 05 17:25:45 <ne2k>	diverdude, yes, make a model of your database out of string
Sep 05 17:25:52 <diverdude>	haha lol
Sep 05 17:25:54 <diverdude>	:D
Sep 05 17:26:04 <ne2k>	crocheted web of information
Sep 05 17:26:15 <Poster>	The webserver will already have access to the sensitive data, putting a firewall between the two will not change that
Sep 05 17:26:37 <diverdude>	true
Sep 05 17:27:07 <ne2k>	Poster, the only benefit would be to prevent a full compromise of the web server leading to other attack vectors on the database (other than the legitimate one that web server uses)
Sep 05 17:27:44 <Poster>	yep
Sep 05 17:27:50 <ne2k>	but that can just be done on the database server itself, surely
Sep 05 17:28:45 <ne2k>	seems a bit of a pointless performance hit having all your legitimate traffic go through a firewall. but again, this is just my gut feeling, not particularly well considered. could be wrong for your case
Sep 05 17:28:49 <ne2k>	ymmv, etc.
Sep 05 17:31:53 <ne2k>	diverdude, a threat model is a description of how you think someone might attack your system. what could they do if they gained access to x, how hard would it be, etc. only with this theoretical set of scenarios can you think about how you might improve your security. you can't mitigate against something you haven't identified. "making it more secure" is just too nebulous
Sep 05 17:32:24 <diverdude>	true fact
Sep 05 17:36:07 <jlf>	the best kind of fact

Sep 05 19:19:18 <lineos>	How can I force an email to be sent to a specific mx server?
Sep 05 19:19:51 <detha>	Thuryn: "undefined behaviour". If the user wants one or the other, hostname -s or -f
Sep 05 19:20:25 <Thuryn>	perfect.
Sep 05 19:20:47 <Thuryn>	both systems return the right things with those flags present
Sep 05 19:21:46 <detha>	latest and greates doesn't, I see void has a 'hostname' command that just gives fqdn, with no option for -s
Sep 05 19:23:49 <Thuryn>	my test cases are CentOS 7 and RHEL 8
Sep 05 19:24:33 <Thuryn>	my Fedora 29 box gives the FQDN for no flags and does the right things for -s and -f
Sep 05 19:24:33 <detha>	those two are sane. So is debian, except that it defaults to -s whereas centos defaults to -f
Sep 05 19:25:20 <Thuryn>	i don't really care what `hostname` returns, per se.  what i'm really doing (behind this question) is validating the configuration of this virtual machine as built by the consultant.
Sep 05 19:25:40 <CrazySam>	do i have to waste 1 subnet in order to create 3 subnets?
Sep 05 19:25:44 <Thuryn>	the output of `hostname` on this VM differs from my other machines.  but if that's not a reliable test in the first place, i'm moving on.
Sep 05 19:26:04 <Thuryn>	CrazySam, short answer:  no.
Sep 05 19:27:11 <CrazySam>	Thuryn: short answer is fine for now, i'm just starting to learn about this topic. so i understood correctly. thanks!
Sep 05 19:28:18 <Thuryn>	CrazySam, slightly longer answer:  If you're talking about breaking up a /16 into /18s or something similar, the fourth subnet isn't "wasted" exactly.  it's just not allocated.  it can be used later.
Sep 05 19:28:52 <CrazySam>	:)
Sep 05 19:29:01 <CrazySam>	looking forward to it
Sep 05 19:30:57 <Dagger>	and even if you're never going to use that 4th subnet, it's still not being wasted. subnetting is done on prefixes because it's much faster for routers to handle than splitting up on arbitrary addresses is
Sep 05 19:35:39 <lineos>	If a domain has some mx servers that do not support TLS, is there any way to force the mail to be send via one that supports TLS?
Sep 05 19:37:48 <detha>	Probably not. Depending on your MTA, you may be able to teach it to require TLS.
Sep 05 19:41:19 <Thuryn>	lineos, if SOME of them do, then yes.  if NONE of them support TLS, then no.
Sep 05 19:41:34 <Thuryn>	if your MTA is postfix, then definitely yes.
Sep 05 19:41:52 <lineos>	the high priority mx servers support tls, the lower ones do not
Sep 05 19:44:08 <Thuryn>	even better

Sep 05 21:54:14 <sinshiva>	doesn't support ipv6-only networks as well afaik
Sep 05 21:54:37 <linux_probe>	lol
Sep 05 21:54:54 <sinshiva>	got some dev thread i'm subscribed to that gets a comment once or twice a year regarding v6-only

Sep 05 21:56:42 <mgolisch>	android?
Sep 05 21:56:52 <redsh>	Didn't know about IPv6-only.
Sep 05 21:57:37 <redsh>	How's that, does it need to contact IPv4-only Google servers for telemetry or something? Or doesn't like DNS over IPv6?
Sep 05 21:58:10 <sinshiva>	i think it's more systemic than that, like no v4 simply means no internet or some such
Sep 05 21:58:19 <sinshiva>	been a long while since i looked at it
Sep 05 21:58:33 <BtbN>	It's pretty unlikely for a phone, or any device, to not have IPv4 though.
Sep 05 22:00:10 <sinshiva>	(this is regarding v6 only wifi networks, of course)

Sep 05 22:02:54 <jesse1010>	is it best to have a VPN server on the outside of my firewall?
Sep 05 22:03:22 <jesse1010>	my pc -> firewall -> vpn -> whole house firewall
Sep 05 22:03:43 <BtbN>	Why would you use a VPN inside of your home network?
Sep 05 22:03:46 <koollman>	what would the vpn do, in this context ?
Sep 05 22:04:09 <jesse1010>	ensure all of my traffic goes through the vpn
Sep 05 22:04:16 <rewt>	it makes hist network virtually private :D
Sep 05 22:04:18 <rewt>	-t
Sep 05 22:04:47 <jesse1010>	oh, I see,
Sep 05 22:05:01 <jesse1010>	so the vpn would just go through the whole house firewall, right?
Sep 05 22:05:08 <koollman>	jesse1010: yes
Sep 05 22:05:40 <koollman>	it is a reasonable place, that is, you can protect access to the vpn. but that's generally handled by not having it accessible from elsewhere
Sep 05 22:05:48 <jesse1010>	the vpn could be on the 2nd firewall, so essentially it would be two pfsense boxes
Sep 05 22:06:13 <jesse1010>	The idea is that I would want to use pfsense to block/unblock ips
Sep 05 22:06:14 <koollman>	are the two firewalls otherwise needed ?
Sep 05 22:06:31 <jesse1010>	but it cant do that if I am using a vpn with my connection, right?
Sep 05 22:08:47 <koollman>	jesse1010: once your traffic goes throuhg the vpn, the next firewall only see something between the vpn and the vpn remote point
Sep 05 22:09:32 <jesse1010>	yes exactly, which is why the firewall would be first, then the vpn (another pfsense system)
Sep 05 22:09:43 <TJ->	Is anyone familiar with bind9's NSEC3 zone (re)signing breaking when the NSEC3PARAM RR is in the zone file?
Sep 05 22:10:55 <koollman>	jesse1010: if it's pfsense, and your vpn client can run on it, you do not need two. it can drop traffic incoming on the interface, before forwarding it into the vpn, I think

Sep 06 09:59:42 <detha>	How are customers connected to this setup?
Sep 06 10:01:26 <krigu>	detha: they're connected directly to our core-switches (untagged or tagged vlan port), static-ip configuration on customer-firewalls
Sep 06 10:02:47 <detha>	you have no control over the customer-firewalls?
Sep 06 10:03:39 <krigu>	it depends, but there are some where we don't have control
Sep 06 10:06:52 <detha>	so with vlan-per-customer you have a hard limit at about 4000 customers. QinQ? Or just a bunch of ACLs, and automation.
Sep 06 10:10:38 <veek>	okay so i got it to work by adding 'udp sport { 53 } accept'
Sep 06 10:10:58 <veek>	on the OUTPUT chain - why the heck does it work?
Sep 06 10:11:17 <detha>	krigu: or, depending what sort of switches you have towards custemers, something MPLS, but that sounds like killing a mosquito with a sledgehammer
Sep 06 10:12:40 <veek>	nm figured it.. a local process will use output to o/p its pkts
Sep 06 10:24:57 <krigu>	detha: the vlan limit of 4k is not a problem. we could create a vlan and /28 subnet per customer but it doesn't scale well if they need more IPs. So better create a bigger subnet/vlan and secure them with ACL? need to check if our brocade-switches can set port-security to only allow traffic from assigned IPs. Arp will be another problem
Sep 06 10:27:03 <pppingme>	krigu just do static arp, then regardless of how bad a customer screws the pooch, the customer facing equipment won't be confused
Sep 06 10:30:05 <krigu>	pppingme: good idea.. but customer could still bring up the default-gateway and confuse others arp-cache, right?
Sep 06 10:30:41 <pppingme>	mac-lock the ports
Sep 06 10:44:32 <detha>	krigu: best you can do for address allocation is 'sparse allocation', when you allocat a new /28 leave the next 1 (or 3) /28s reserved, next customer gets the one after that. When you run into the top of your address space, start chipping away at the gaps for customers that are unlikely to grow
Sep 06 11:08:03 <Tazmain>	hi all, I am sitting with a mikrotik hex, and trying to reset it , but nothing happens when I hold in the reset button, and I can't login with the default creds either. Is this device bricked?
Sep 06 11:12:23 <squ>	https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Reset
Sep 06 11:14:37 <Tazmain>	that isn't working squ
Sep 06 11:15:26 <squ>	make sure you follow manual
Sep 06 11:15:50 <Tazmain>	I di d
Sep 06 11:15:52 <Tazmain>	I did
Sep 06 11:16:14 <squ>	I have nothing else to say
Sep 06 11:16:17 <Tazmain>	which network port is the default to connect
Sep 06 11:16:36 <Tazmain>	I did google and found that if the reset does not work, it could be bricked'
Sep 06 11:16:56 <Tazmain>	now the network won't come up
Sep 06 11:17:45 <squ>	what happened with router before you decided to reset?
Sep 06 11:18:14 <Tazmain>	It was left in a box, and wasn't used, noone knew the password
Sep 06 11:18:51 <squ>	then there should be no reason for a brick
Sep 06 11:19:15 <Tazmain>	well I see signs of the board sweating though
Sep 06 11:19:38 <Tazmain>	I don't know what was done to it
Sep 06 11:20:03 <squ>	maybe it was broken before?
Sep 06 11:21:09 <Tazmain>	that is all I can assume
Sep 06 11:25:35 <Tazmain>	squ, what is really odd, is I can't find that reset jumper on the board either, even the manual says they should all have it
Sep 06 11:26:12 <squ>	another model maybe
Sep 06 11:27:38 <squ>	a fake?
Sep 06 11:27:45 <squ>	do they do fake routers?
Sep 06 11:27:47 <squ>	:)
Sep 06 11:30:20 <zmoo>	zmoo: hello me
Sep 06 11:32:31 <Tazmain>	squ, so turns out the wiki is out of date, I found a video, saying hold in the reset and the power it on
Sep 06 11:32:50 <squ>	manual says hold reset during boot
Sep 06 11:33:20 <Tazmain>	I think I was setting it to network flash mode
Sep 06 11:33:21 <squ>	which means the same thing as “and power on”
Sep 06 11:34:44 <Tazmain>	well I left if off for a bit as well before retrying
Sep 06 11:36:15 <Tazmain>	-__- reboot and back to square one.
Sep 06 11:49:51 <Tazmain>	squ, well up and running now thanks, seemed to have lost itself when I powered it off though. hopefully it won't do that again
Sep 06 11:54:46 <squ>	cool
Sep 06 13:06:49 <Paddy_NI>	Hi I just got my hands on a "cisco c887vam-k9 v01" and I am wondering if there is anything fun/interesting/beneficial that can be done with this thing at my home?
Sep 06 13:07:11 <Paddy_NI>	Any rough ideas would be cool, I really don't like wasting things.
Sep 06 13:11:13 <squ>	learn ios on hardware
Sep 06 13:11:31 <Paddy_NI>	squ, That's true
Sep 06 13:11:42 <Paddy_NI>	I could definitely do that.
Sep 06 13:12:23 <Paddy_NI>	My desktop pc has a serial port
Sep 06 13:14:08 <squ>	use ssh
Sep 06 13:14:43 <Kim^J>	Standard SOHO all-in-one box?
Sep 06 13:15:26 <Paddy_NI>	This previously was used at a clients business, should I do something to reset it back to factory settings?  I am guessing it would be better to get as close to an ootb experience as possible
Sep 06 13:16:05 <Paddy_NI>	Kim^J, I am not quite sure what it's main selling point is to be honest, I have literally only just got my hands on it
Sep 06 13:41:05 <AndrewPRS>	hi there! does www.google.com work for you guys?

Sep 06 13:57:15 <squ>	fight it with catgif
Sep 06 14:03:16 <TeixeiraRafael>	Hey, when I get a response from a server over a wifi connection, the MAC address of the server comes in the 802.11 packet? Or just the router's mac?
Sep 06 14:07:14 <squ>	I guess its the mac router associates with the server
Sep 06 14:10:32 <BtbN>	MAC does not get routed, it's L2
Sep 06 14:10:48 <squ>	so I confused this with nat procedure
Sep 06 14:24:34 <redecas>	I have a ssh connection to a server X opened from /dev/pts/0 ; how can I access that connection and send commands to the server X, but from /dev/pts/1  ?
Sep 06 14:25:43 <i336>	redecas: rephrased, you want to redirect /dev/pts/1 into /dev/pts/0 ?
Sep 06 14:25:52 <i336>	(bidirectionally)
Sep 06 14:50:12 <cnf>	i336: lay em next to each other, flipped!
Sep 06 14:50:15 <cnf>	like old phones!
Sep 06 14:58:50 <theluckymike>	TeixeiraRafael: if server is in same subnet as you in wifi, you will see servers mac, if it is on differet one - mac will be of your router
Sep 06 15:00:06 <theluckymike>	thats how tcp/ip works, no matter are you on wifi or connected by cable
Sep 06 15:05:14 <cnf>	next hop
Sep 06 15:13:20 <veek>	how do you specify an interface specific rule in nftables

Sep 07 11:13:20 <azonenberg>	Is there any situation in which an Ethernet switch would forward a frame out the same interface it came from?
Sep 07 11:22:36 <c|oneman>	doesnt a flood forward to all interfaces?
Sep 07 11:22:52 <xand>	azonenberg: I believe some switches can be configured to do so (e.g. for certain VM hosting situations) but not normally
Sep 07 11:23:54 <c|oneman>	if you had an unmanged switch connected the frames would have to go in and out the same interface for the computers to talk to each other
Sep 07 11:24:45 <azonenberg>	So, my current plan is to allow unicasts to come out the same port they were received on
Sep 07 11:24:57 <azonenberg>	broadcast/multicast will be sent to all relevant ports, but not out the source
Sep 07 11:25:06 <azonenberg>	since it seems like doing otherwise could very easily create broadcast loops
Sep 07 11:25:19 <azonenberg>	(if you have two switches connected ping-ponging the broadcasts forever)
Sep 07 11:33:41 <azonenberg>	Unicasts to unknown addresses will be treated like broadcasts
Sep 07 11:34:18 <azonenberg>	i'm going to assume if you sent me a frame that goes somewhere I've never seen before, that it doesn't go to you
Sep 07 11:35:21 <Apachez>	DLF actually
Sep 07 11:35:30 <Apachez>	destination lookup failure
Sep 07 11:35:41 <Apachez>	egress on all interfaces who belongs the same vlan except the one it arrived at
Sep 07 11:35:44 <eraserpencil>	hi guys, I need help wwith network debugging. I have an ethernet cable connected to my laptop, but for some odd reason, I am unable to detect it. I know the cable works because when I connect it to another computer, that computer is able to ping the device on the other end. I am currently working on Ubuntu 16.04
Sep 07 11:36:00 <Apachez>	eraserpencil: enable that nic?
Sep 07 11:36:05 <Apachez>	install drivers for that nic?
Sep 07 11:36:09 <Apachez>	what does lspci tell you?
Sep 07 11:36:53 <eraserpencil>	i think the nic is working cause im connected on wifi now
Sep 07 11:38:15 <azonenberg>	Apachez: ok good, that makes sense
Sep 07 11:38:32 <eraserpencil>	it's Ethernet controller: Qualcomm Atheros Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 10)
Sep 07 11:38:32 <eraserpencil>	 if it helps
Sep 07 11:38:33 <azonenberg>	eraserpencil: the wifi and ethernet cards and drivers are completely separate
Sep 07 11:38:39 <azonenberg>	one working does not imply anything about the other
Sep 07 11:38:47 <eraserpencil>	hmmmm
Sep 07 11:39:50 <eraserpencil>	ah hah
Sep 07 11:40:02 <eraserpencil>	enp111s0 ethernet is unmanaged
Sep 07 11:41:51 <eraserpencil>	how would i manage it?
Sep 07 11:43:58 <azonenberg>	That's a distro specific question I think
Sep 07 11:44:37 <azonenberg>	(I also don't use network-manager at all, so maybe someone else here will be more helpful
Sep 07 11:49:19 <Apachez>	yeah atheros is normally wifi
Sep 07 12:08:40 <yuradoc>	Hello. Don't know what to do with founded Cisco ASA router on the bug bounty target. It's web interface is very outdated, so possibly firmware is old and needs update. I found interesting  exploit for the https://t.co/tSjOijrb8N, but target's rules forbid DoS. RCE is too often border with DoS. I'm new in ethical hacking, what you can say base on you experience? Thanks
Sep 07 12:10:23 <azonenberg>	yuradoc: Try to fingerprint the firmware version
Sep 07 12:10:45 <azonenberg>	if you can ID it, then submit
Sep 07 12:10:56 <yuradoc>	ok, good idea...
Sep 07 12:11:00 <azonenberg>	If not, you may have to just accept "probably vulnerable but can't prove it"
Sep 07 12:11:35 <azonenberg>	Messing with RCE on a production system is risky at best, and in a bug bounty scenario where you don't have prior coordination with the target's IT department it could easily go very wrong
Sep 07 12:12:01 <yuradoc>	yes
Sep 07 12:12:10 <azonenberg>	Extreme example: my first solo project at $dayjob was an external network pentest for [redacted]
Sep 07 12:12:41 <azonenberg>	We found an old unpatched ubuntu box from the marketing department on their network that was swiss cheese... PII of clients in easily guessable subdirectories, homegrown PHP scripts with SQL injection up the wazoo, etc
Sep 07 12:13:24 <azonenberg>	as far as i could tell, there was no filtering for sql injection any one of the form fields but there was a huge number and i didnt want to test them by hand
Sep 07 12:13:41 <azonenberg>	ROE for the engagement required prior approval for running automated scans, so I checked with the client and he said sure, go ahead and sqlmap it
Sep 07 12:14:04 <azonenberg>	Two hours later, right as it finishes, I get an urgent email from the customer "Whatever you're doing, stop it NOW!"
Sep 07 12:14:14 <azonenberg>	Their entire production network had no connectivity to the internet whatsoever
Sep 07 12:14:30 <azonenberg>	yuradoc: wanna guess what happened? :p
Sep 07 12:14:49 <yuradoc>	oh yes, it could be really scary
Sep 07 12:15:00 <azonenberg>	i meant root cause for the failure
Sep 07 12:15:02 <yuradoc>	no... don't wanna
Sep 07 12:15:04 <azonenberg>	Lol
Sep 07 12:15:27 <azonenberg>	They had some kind of firewall/WAF/VPN/border router all in one appliance, probably from one of those enterprisey companies you see ads for in airports
Sep 07 12:15:52 <azonenberg>	Apparently my hand crafted sql injection slipped under the radar, but about 1% of sqlmap's queries triggered alerts
Sep 07 12:15:55 <azonenberg>	It had a memory leak
Sep 07 12:16:35 <azonenberg>	So umpteen thousand IDS alerts in the span of a couple hours = DoS of the whole appliance. Lol
Sep 07 12:17:03 <detha>	LOL. So secure, nobody can get in or out
Sep 07 12:17:12 <azonenberg>	detha: i wrote that up as a new critical finding
Sep 07 12:17:26 <azonenberg>	all you needed is one port 80 opening on the network anywhere, doesnt have to actually be sql injectable
Sep 07 12:17:34 <azonenberg>	and in a matter of hours you can DoS the whole company
Sep 07 12:17:45 <azonenberg>	Gonna guess they got a new appliance after that. Lol
Sep 07 12:18:03 <azonenberg>	I actually didn't get in trouble for it, but only because I had previously coordinated with the client's IT department and they had explicitly approved the scan
Sep 07 12:18:22 <azonenberg>	During a postmortem of the incident, everyone agreed that this was absolutely not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of a sqlmap scan
Sep 07 12:18:31 <azonenberg>	They understood and accepted the risk of the marketing box going down
Sep 07 12:18:44 <yuradoc>	yes, you are right
Sep 07 12:19:09 <azonenberg>	But this was a risk nobody knew existed
Sep 07 12:19:22 <azonenberg>	anyway yeah, made scarier by the fact that it was my first solo project at the firm :)
Sep 07 12:19:30 <yuradoc>	i can try to fingerprint and report what i have found. then ask them maybe they'll allow to test my exploit
Sep 07 12:20:03 <yuradoc>	yes, very interesting experience azonenberg
Sep 07 12:20:04 <azonenberg>	Yeah. Or maybe they'll test in house, or just do a "show ver", and give you credit for it without needing to exploit
Sep 07 12:20:19 <azonenberg>	Or maybe they'll internally confirm it's not exploitable
Sep 07 12:20:35 <yuradoc>	great
Sep 07 12:20:36 <azonenberg>	Either way, gather the info you can and run with it as much as you can. Sometimes I have to do stuff like this at work too
Sep 07 12:21:18 <yuradoc>	thank you!
Sep 07 12:21:25 <azonenberg>	and just tell them "You appear to be using FooService v1.2.0-1.2.3. We know that 1.2.2 and older have an RCE vuln, but testing it risks downtime. Please check the exact version number installed and take action accordingly"
Sep 07 12:21:52 <yuradoc>	yeah, someth like that
Sep 07 12:21:55 <yuradoc>	))
Sep 07 12:22:05 <yuradoc>	thank you and for the story
Sep 07 12:22:06 <snappy>	azonenberg: hah cool story
Sep 07 12:32:22 <yuradoc>	also guys, maybe you know, but for me it's not too clear. bug bounty program allow RCE, SQL/XML Injection, but one of the "Grounds for Disqualification " is "Code injection on live systems"
Sep 07 12:33:09 <yuradoc>	how it could be interpreted?
Sep 07 12:34:04 <azonenberg>	I interpret that to mean that you are allowed to identify RCE bugs but not exploit them
Sep 07 12:34:55 <yuradoc>	hm, but how i can test sql injection without testing
Sep 07 12:35:03 <yuradoc>	for example
Sep 07 12:35:18 <azonenberg>	That's a bit gray, i'd ask them to confirm - but most likely they mean you can't send any queries that would give you access you shouldn't have
Sep 07 12:35:25 <azonenberg>	no selects of tables, no inserts, deletes, etc
Sep 07 12:35:33 <azonenberg>	but a "select 1+1" would probably be ok
Sep 07 12:35:57 <azonenberg>	even that could be interpreted as code injection though, so i'd ask before trying it
Sep 07 12:36:09 <yuradoc>	ok...
Sep 07 12:37:24 <yuradoc>	i read yesterday such separation: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/168327/difference-between-code-injection-command-injection-and-remote-code-execution
Sep 07 12:38:09 <yuradoc>	but it seemsed for me there is no "strict" definithions of such terms
Sep 07 12:39:00 <azonenberg>	Yeah its very much up to whoever wrote it
Sep 07 12:39:05 <azonenberg>	Which is why i say ask if there's any doubt
Sep 07 12:39:31 <yuradoc>	yes, right
Sep 07 12:39:40 <yuradoc>	tnx
Sep 07 13:10:20 <azonenberg>	Woooooo
Sep 07 13:10:31 <azonenberg>	Major milestone on my switch fabric
Sep 07 13:10:51 <azonenberg>	Just successfully forwarded a broadcast frame (in simulation) through the crossbar
Sep 07 13:11:03 <azonenberg>	Then it disappeared, as i have no exit queues or tagging logic or any of that stuff yet :p
Sep 07 13:11:32 <azonenberg>	But all of the MAC lookup logic worked as designed, it was marked as broadcast, got broadcasted correctly, popped off the input queue, etc
Sep 07 14:14:33 <DJHenjin>	so, I have a cisco 4507R switch, with 5 48 port gigabit modules installed in it, and I want to switch to using it for my main fabric, however for some reason, I can't seem to reset its config to factory as I cannot get into it via console cable, is there another way to reset it?
Sep 07 14:20:33 <xingu>	DJHenjin: what supervisor does it have?
Sep 07 14:23:30 <DJHenjin>	supervisor engine 2+ model #ws-x4013+
Sep 07 14:25:58 <xingu>	DJHenjin: and you see nothing at all on console during bootup? can I safely assume you're using a known good console cable / setup that's worked with other cisco iron?
Sep 07 14:27:03 <DJHenjin>	yes and no
Sep 07 14:28:21 <DJHenjin>	my desktop has worked with other cisco iron, however it has stopped doing so, and I can't figure out why, I can spin up on e of the other 25 servers I have with a console cable connected to it though to verify the switch and the cable
Sep 07 14:29:48 <xingu>	DJHenjin: ok, so a working console port is pretty fundamental to this X4013+; the SoC literally has no ethernet until the bootrom is run, so if you need to break before the config file is processed, you need to have console connectivity
Sep 07 14:30:46 <xingu>	DJHenjin: it's only relatively recent things (that also tend to have USB console) that (again) separate the IO processor from the main SoC in a way that breaks this catch-22
Sep 07 14:30:55 <DJHenjin>	I have confirmed that the switch does boot up, I had it connected to my network, and it showed up in CDP neighbors
Sep 07 14:31:09 <DJHenjin>	i'll get a server spun up with console cable
Sep 07 14:32:44 <xingu>	DJHenjin: I buy integrated usbserial + 8p8c cable these days, less futzing around (than trying to persuade legacy 8250/16550-ish uarts to work in a modern pc)
Sep 07 14:33:15 <xingu>	https://www.amazon.co.uk/Console-RJ45-1-8M-Replaces-72-3383-01-compatible/dp/B071YJRPGX etc.
Sep 07 14:39:28 <DJHenjin>	i wouldnt exactly call these modern, nor do i ever have issues with serial
Sep 07 14:39:35 <xingu>	DJHenjin: also highly recommend this for remote hands applications: https://www.get-console.com/shop/
Sep 07 14:40:22 <DJHenjin>	I am the remote hands, and I have a way into the network already
Sep 07 14:44:51 <DJHenjin>	alright, autoboot cancelled
Sep 07 14:51:57 <DJHenjin>	ok, I have the switch on console now,
Sep 07 14:57:47 <threenuc>	If I changed the records for my domain (A, CNAME etc.), is there a particular DNS to which the change will propagate the quickest? Not sure how it works but I assume if I change records I need 2 days for it to fully propagate, no? Seems insane when you
Sep 07 14:58:19 <threenuc>	when you're just fiddling with something trying your luck if it's gonna work
Sep 07 14:58:22 <grawity>	no
Sep 07 14:58:35 <grawity>	the amount of time it takes depends on the TTL setting that your old value had
Sep 07 14:59:05 <DJHenjin>	you can set the TTL to a smaller value, if you want to guarantee propogation quicker, but in my experience DNS propagates fairly fast
Sep 07 14:59:11 <grawity>	so if your TTL for that subdomain is currently e.g. "2 hours" then it'll take at most 2 hours for the old value to disappear from caches
Sep 07 14:59:25 <grawity>	(people who never had it cached will just immediately see the new value anyway)
Sep 07 14:59:46 <grawity>	and if you're going to play around, well, just set the TTL to like 5 minutes
Sep 07 15:00:08 <threenuc>	I'm comparing two scenarios: buying a fresh domain vs editing an existing one. The propagation with a new domain takes 2 days, right? but when I have an existing one the changes update in [TTL amount] minutes?
Sep 07 15:00:24 <grawity>	no, with a new domain it's the same
Sep 07 15:00:35 <DJHenjin>	they will be comparable
Sep 07 15:00:44 <grawity>	people who had the old data in cache (the negative "no such domain" response) will have it in cache for <TTL> seconds
Sep 07 15:00:55 <grawity>	except the TTL is taken from the parent domain's SOA MINTTL
Sep 07 15:01:06 <grawity>	and people who never had the old data cached will also see the new data instantly
Sep 07 15:01:31 <grawity>	unless, if by "new domain" you literally mean buying a domain and updating NS delegations and all that
Sep 07 15:01:40 <grawity>	that can take longer since it involves more systems than just DNS
Sep 07 15:01:41 <threenuc>	huh, with namecheap (and checking with a dns propagation website) I had to wait ~24 hrs. Ok but thanks I'll try playing with the TTL value
Sep 07 15:02:10 <threenuc>	I mean going to namecheap and registering a new base domain (eg example.com)
Sep 07 15:02:33 <grawity>	the registrar which sold you the domain needs to submit it to the registry; the registry needs to update records at the TLD and push out the change to all of their *authoritative* nameservers (that's where the term 'propagation' *really* applies)
Sep 07 15:02:51 <grawity>	that stuff can definitely take days, although it varies, some TLDs do it really fast
Sep 07 15:03:09 <grawity>	(for me it usually takes up to an hour, worst case)
Sep 07 15:03:40 <threenuc>	ok I understand now :) first time buying domains and I was in the dark. thanks a lot
Sep 07 15:06:09 <grawity>	so when you're editing DNS records inside Namecheap, there can still be a delay while Namecheap pushes out changes to the domain's authoritative servers... but for most providers that's instant since it's just their own internal systems (only some, like Linode, still do it on a 10-min or 15-min schedule)
Sep 07 15:15:50 <Janusss>	Hi anyone know why my ipv6 connection drops every half an hour?
Sep 07 15:15:59 <Janusss>	I used my router to ping ipv6 site is working
Sep 07 15:16:46 <grawity>	what do you mean by "ipv6 connection drops" then?
Sep 07 15:16:52 <Janusss>	If my network adapter in my computer is disabled and re-enabled the ipv6 works again
Sep 07 15:17:05 <Janusss>	shows not internet access through ipv6
Sep 07 15:18:14 <Janusss>	is that some sorts of ipv6 lease problem?
Sep 07 15:18:49 <grawity>	you said you can still ping ipv6 hosts?
Sep 07 15:19:17 <Janusss>	on the terminal of my router
Sep 07 15:19:20 <Janusss>	not my computer
Sep 07 15:19:32 <Janusss>	so the connection is not broken from my router
Sep 07 15:19:38 <Janusss>	just my computer
Sep 07 15:19:56 <grawity>	check whether you still have an IPv6 address and a default route on your computer
Sep 07 15:20:09 <grawity>	it kinda sounds like your router is not sending SLAAC Router Advertisements frequently enough
Sep 07 15:20:26 <Janusss>	I still have ipv6 address but no gateway
Sep 07 15:20:34 <grawity>	so the advertised "router lifetime" is expiring then
Sep 07 15:21:34 <Janusss>	https://imgur.com/a/pob0Wss
Sep 07 15:21:39 <Janusss>	Please tell me which one
Sep 07 15:22:03 <grawity>	looks like "default-lifetime"
Sep 07 15:22:15 <Janusss>	Change to higher or lower?
Sep 07 15:22:28 <Janusss>	it was empty
Sep 07 15:22:40 <Janusss>	I filled it with some nonsense
Sep 07 15:22:51 <grawity>	if it was empty, set it to ... I dunno, 3x of "max-interval"
Sep 07 15:22:56 <grawity>	or something like that
Sep 07 15:23:19 <grawity>	so that the PC will have a few chances to pick up a new update before the original one expires
Sep 07 15:23:20 <Janusss>	okay thanks, I will try
Sep 07 15:24:18 <grawity>	this looks like a frontend to Linux radvd, so the defaults are probably the same as in https://linux.die.net/man/5/radvd.conf ... which says "3x max-interval" is already the default
Sep 07 15:24:18 <grawity>	hmm
Sep 07 15:26:35 <CrazySam>	how many IP numbers does 196.196.0.0/16 represent?
Sep 07 15:26:41 <grawity>	2**16
Sep 07 15:26:55 <grawity>	well, 2**(32-16)
Sep 07 15:27:13 <grawity>	either way, 65536 in total
Sep 07 15:27:13 <CrazySam>	65536?
Sep 07 15:27:18 <CrazySam>	ok
Sep 07 15:27:55 <grawity>	it's always 2**(32-x) for any /x
Sep 07 15:28:00 <Janusss>	Waait grawity, so 3x of the max-interval is the setting I should try?
Sep 07 15:28:03 <Habbie>	(in ipv4 :)
Sep 07 15:28:19 <grawity>	Janusss: well, it's the advised setting
Sep 07 15:28:32 <Janusss>	Okay, thanks a lot
Sep 07 15:28:32 <grawity>	Janusss: but of course would be a good idea to check whether it's actually the problem
Sep 07 15:28:44 <Janusss>	Yep
Sep 07 15:28:49 <grawity>	i.e. boot up Wireshark on a problematic client, set it to capture icmp6, then watch whether you receive any RAs over the hour
Sep 07 15:29:02 <grawity>	(or tcpdump for that matter)
Sep 07 15:34:42 <CrazySam>	is a "block" of ip addresses the same thing as a range of ip addresses?
Sep 07 15:36:09 <grawity>	somewhat depends on context, but I would say that a "block" is always CIDR-based while a "range" can be either CIDR or first..last
Sep 07 15:38:22 <Habbie>	that's general usage yet
Sep 07 15:38:26 <Habbie>	yes
Sep 07 15:45:39 <CrazySam>	i see...
Sep 07 15:46:02 <Habbie>	but, when in doubt, find out
Sep 07 15:46:09 <Habbie>	people do the weirdest things with words
Sep 07 15:46:43 <CrazySam>	a block needs to be continuous, so any continuous range of addresses (which is what a range is by definition) is a block
Sep 07 15:47:18 <CrazySam>	unless you have a superblock i guess?... with non-continuous ranges...
Sep 07 15:47:18 <Habbie>	that's pretty much the opposite of what grawity and i said
Sep 07 15:47:25 <Habbie>	what's a "superblock"?
Sep 07 15:48:01 <CrazySam>	a block that contains a block?
Sep 07 15:48:28 <Habbie>	i don't feel this conversation is useful given that the terms are only vaguely defined to  begin with
Sep 07 15:48:41 <Habbie>	every 'block' contains 'blocks' until you reach the minimum size of 1
Sep 07 15:48:47 <Habbie>	every 'range' contains 'ranges' until etc.
Sep 07 15:56:44 <tairikuookami>	superblock tends to refer to things like 207.208.109.0/14
Sep 07 15:57:02 <tairikuookami>	(larger than the the expected class-a/b/c ranges would normally indicate)
Sep 07 15:57:10 <Habbie>	ah
Sep 07 15:57:12 <Habbie>	but classes are dead
Sep 07 15:57:17 <Habbie>	have been for >20 years now
Sep 07 15:57:19 <tairikuookami>	and yet ..
Sep 07 15:57:19 <Habbie>	a /14 is just a /14
Sep 07 15:57:27 <grawity>	who even expects class-a/b/c range sizes these days
Sep 07 15:57:52 <tairikuookami>	Habbie, you're missing the point a bit.  class a ranges with a /14 is "normal".  class b range with a /14 is not.
Sep 07 15:58:09 <catphish>	tairikuookami: you need to relearn networking, there are no classes any more
Sep 07 15:58:14 <Habbie>	tairikuookami, i'm not missing the point; i'm disagreeing with anybody using 'class' anywhere, and thus disagreeing with 'superblock' as a term
Sep 07 15:58:20 <grawity>	tairikuookami: no, that is exactly the point: both have become completely normal since then
Sep 07 15:58:33 <grawity>	(also I've heard the term 'supernet' for exactly this, but never 'superblock'...)
Sep 07 15:58:45 <tairikuookami>	catphish, someone asked what superblocks were.  i've been around long enough to remember that.
Sep 07 15:58:50 <Habbie>	supernet, yes - that term also became obsolete when we dropped classes
Sep 07 15:59:04 <Habbie>	tairikuookami, in classful times, 207.x.x/14 was a supernet, not a superblock
Sep 07 15:59:12 <catphish>	a supernet is more generically any network that encompasses some other networks
Sep 07 15:59:26 <tairikuookami>	yes, classless is normal these days
Sep 07 15:59:49 <Janusss>	@grawity Still not working
Sep 07 16:00:12 <Janusss>	The gateway goes away after 30mins
Sep 07 16:00:14 <catphish>	 but yeah, there is literally no relationship netween address and network size
Sep 07 16:00:23 <zer0def>	grawity | who even expects class-a/b/c range sizes these days -- ipv6 client networks
Sep 07 16:00:29 <grawity>	Janusss: did you check whether the client is actually receiving those Router Solicitations
Sep 07 16:00:33 <catphish>	there hasn't been for like 20 years
Sep 07 16:00:45 <Habbie>	zer0def, what?
Sep 07 16:00:48 <grawity>	zer0def: ipv6 doesn't use initial-bit-based sizes, does it
Sep 07 16:00:55 <Janusss>	Yeah it gets solicitations from the router
Sep 07 16:01:03 <zer0def>	it doesn't, but the sizes are fluffin' huge
Sep 07 16:01:04 <Janusss>	I was watching the wireshark
Sep 07 16:01:09 <Habbie>	ipv6 uses prefix lengths and, like classless v4, they are strictly arbitrary
Sep 07 16:01:22 <grawity>	Janusss: errr, I meant Router Advertisements
Sep 07 16:01:29 <Janusss>	Yep
Sep 07 16:01:36 <catphish>	Habbie: that's not 100% true, /64 is absolutely a special case recommended for LANs
Sep 07 16:01:50 <Janusss>	It gets router advertisements occasionally
Sep 07 16:01:50 <Habbie>	catphish, ah, you're right - although that is under discussion in IETF too i understand..
Sep 07 16:01:58 <grawity>	there's a whole RFC dedicated to discussing the /64 split
Sep 07 16:02:01 <Janusss>	nothing after 30mins though,,,
Sep 07 16:02:15 <grawity>	Janusss: as in it stops getting the advertisements?
Sep 07 16:02:25 <Janusss>	yep
Sep 07 16:02:35 <catphish>	Habbie: i always thought /64 was silly, there's an argument for just splitting the bits in half, but seems really excessive
Sep 07 16:02:48 <grawity>	is the client wired or wi-fi? does it run linux or windows?
Sep 07 16:02:57 <Habbie>	catphish, i understand /64 is partially based on that it allows stateless IP assignment to clients
Sep 07 16:02:58 <turtle>	insanely excessive.. the only part of it that makes sense is that at least a /64 is semi-readable
Sep 07 16:03:05 <Janusss>	Also got a router advertisement at last fill second
Sep 07 16:03:19 <Janusss>	client is windows
Sep 07 16:03:31 <catphish>	Habbie: that's the idea, indeed
Sep 07 16:03:59 <grawity>	hmm I wonder what's the modern equivalent of `netsh interface ipv6 renew`
Sep 07 16:04:09 <grawity>	maybe `ipconfig /renew6`
Sep 07 16:04:18 <Dagger>	/64 is an excessive number of addresses
Sep 07 16:04:55 <Janusss>	yeah, it's ipconfig /renew6
Sep 07 16:04:56 <Dagger>	but as a cryptographic key size (as used by SEND to secure NDP), it's not particularly excessive
Sep 07 16:05:01 <Janusss>	but how to auto run it?
Sep 07 16:05:16 <grawity>	the point isn't to auto-run it, but to figure out why you always stop getting RAs
Sep 07 16:05:22 <Janusss>	I have to run it every 30mins.....
Sep 07 16:05:31 <grawity>	does /renew6 send out a Router Solicitation?
Sep 07 16:05:37 <grawity>	if it does, then do you get a RA in response?
Sep 07 16:05:38 <tairikuookami>	the term superblock is also obsolete.
Sep 07 16:05:48 <grawity>	and then do you begin getting scheduled RAs again?
Sep 07 16:06:45 <Janusss>	getting some icmpv6 again
Sep 07 16:06:57 <Janusss>	but the ipv6 test is not passing
Sep 07 16:07:17 <Janusss>	but if I disable and re-enable my ethernet, it works again
Sep 07 16:07:27 <zer0def>	well, *technically* ipv4 is obsolete
Sep 07 16:07:29 *	zer0def ducks
Sep 07 16:07:49 <Janusss>	getting neighbor solicitation, not router advertisement
Sep 07 16:07:52 <tairikuookami>	zer0def, dead, not gone
Sep 07 16:08:12 <zer0def>	how does being dead-but-not-gone work? :o
Sep 07 16:08:29 <tairikuookami>	you're still using it, so it's not gone
Sep 07 16:09:08 <zer0def>	that's a flimsy statement, at best
Sep 07 16:12:19 <tairikuookami>	~97% of the internet traffic flows are still v4 based.  almost nobody's using v6 commercially, basically
Sep 07 16:13:09 <tds>	https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html comes to mind :)
Sep 07 16:13:15 <zer0def>	then it's hardly dead.
Sep 07 16:13:25 <zer0def>	just too fat for it's pants
Sep 07 16:14:01 <Dagger>	tairikuookami: last stat I saw (for EE in the UK) was that 70% of their traffic goes over v6
Sep 07 16:14:02 <tairikuookami>	tds, from your own link, click on the countries using it.
Sep 07 16:14:43 <Dagger>	and that represents a substantial reduction in cost for their CGNAT hardware, since they only need one third the capacity they otherwise would
Sep 07 16:14:50 <tairikuookami>	Dagger, oh?  i just looked a moment ago, and could not find anything indicating that the internet traffic was substantially using v6.  (excluding i2).  got a url?
Sep 07 16:15:05 <tds>	tairikuookami: ah, I missed the start of this discussion, was there some location context?
Sep 07 16:15:25 <Dagger>	tairikuookami: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16FdlxyFQgY&t=1009
Sep 07 16:17:06 <tairikuookami>	Dagger, that's rather inconvenient. i was hoping for more flow-based stats.
Sep 07 16:18:25 <Dagger>	percentage of flows is going to be smaller, because a lot of the v6 flows will be video (and a lot of the v4 flows will be botnets, scanners etc)
Sep 07 16:18:25 <Janusss>	https://imgur.com/a/jWm0bvn That's what I get after ipconfig /renew6
Sep 07 16:18:51 <Dagger>	but when it comes down to a question of how much money you need to spend on your routing and CGNAT hardware, flows isn't the important figure
Sep 07 16:19:39 <tds>	flows sounds pretty critical for cgnat, depending on how you're doing it
Sep 07 16:24:10 <Dagger>	...hm, fair point perhaps, but as I understand it the performance of CGNAT boxes is measured in packets per second
Sep 07 16:24:25 <Dagger>	the general idea being to offload as much of that as possible to a straight-through v6 path
Sep 07 16:26:37 <Dagger>	tairikuookami: another thing to note is that some major ISPs are using NAT64, i.e. their internal network is entirely v6, with connections to v4 hosts being translated to v4 at the border of the ISP
Sep 07 16:26:52 <Dagger>	tairikuookami: if you're looking at internet-wide stats then you're not going to see any of that
Sep 07 16:27:03 <Habbie>	Dagger, the performance of CGNAT boxes is also measured in active sessions and session churn, depending on the technology chosen

Sep 07 17:13:31 <tsujp>	Hi, I have a number of hosts and I want said hosts to appear under the same ipv6 subnet. The provider doesnt do BGP. What options do I have?
Sep 07 17:14:12 <tsujp>	I need something fault tolerant, such that if 1 host goes down they dont all lose their networking so something like 1 machine as a router isn't really possible
Sep 07 17:22:10 <pppingme>	tsujp why do you think you need bgp?
Sep 07 17:22:25 <pppingme>	by definition, all hosts on a network can and should be on the same subnet
Sep 07 17:22:28 <tsujp>	I don't know how to join discrete hosts to appear as one network
Sep 07 17:22:44 <pppingme>	plug them all into the same switch?
Sep 07 17:22:47 <tsujp>	Right, so I have IPA/64 and IPB/64 but I want them to appear as a single IPC/64
Sep 07 17:22:54 <tsujp>	I cannot, this is hosted stuff
Sep 07 17:23:10 <pppingme>	so these are random vps's?
Sep 07 17:23:43 <pppingme>	at different locations?
Sep 07 17:25:32 <tsujp>	They are within the same datacentre but the host only allows a private vSwitch
Sep 07 17:25:48 <tsujp>	Each machine gets its own /64 subnet on ip6
Sep 07 17:26:08 <tsujp>	But if I use one machine as a router if that goes down they all go down as they wont receive traffic anymore, I'm asking the host about a floating IP but I think they only offer this on IPv4
Sep 07 17:26:09 <pppingme>	seems strange that the provider won't put them all on the same /64
Sep 07 17:26:27 <tsujp>	An alternative could be a cloud VM with a failover IP acting as a router? I know they allow IPv6 failover IPs in the cloud
Sep 07 17:26:53 <tsujp>	It's Hetzner
Sep 07 17:26:57 <tsujp>	They do weird things
Sep 07 17:26:58 <pppingme>	let me back up, this feels like #xyproblem why do you need them on the same /64?
Sep 07 17:27:02 <tsujp>	Only if it's in the same rack
Sep 07 17:27:16 <tsujp>	So I can use them on a docker or k8s cluster with the same public IP
Sep 07 17:27:27 <tsujp>	I have services which require a static IP, but I need redundancy
Sep 07 17:28:42 <tsujp>	If I made a cloud VM to do this how would I do that?
Sep 07 17:28:53 <tsujp>	Just forward X receiving address to Y other address?
Sep 07 17:30:07 <pppingme>	without getting into the nitty gritty of your exact app and how its working, is there some reason you can't work around this at a dns level?
Sep 07 17:30:43 <tsujp>	Unfortunately most of these require a raw IP and wont accept a DNS record
Sep 07 17:31:14 <pppingme>	docker doesn't
Sep 07 17:32:03 <tsujp>	So the docker container runs the app, the app is accessed by the client via IP only
Sep 07 17:32:22 <tsujp>	So if the container dies and is respawned the IP _must
Sep 07 17:32:27 <tsujp>	_must_ be the same
Sep 07 17:32:42 <pppingme>	thats worse..  clients should NEVER depend on a static IP.
Sep 07 17:33:04 <tsujp>	Agreed
Sep 07 17:33:11 <tsujp>	But this is the lay of the land unfortunately
Sep 07 17:33:36 <pppingme>	no, the "lay of the land" is to tell the vendor thats unacceptable, and fix it so clients can use dns
Sep 07 17:33:47 <pppingme>	what happens if your vps provider goes belly up?
Sep 07 17:34:13 <pppingme>	with dns, few minor adjustments, 15 minutes later everybody working, with ip, you have to touch each and every client
Sep 07 17:34:37 <tsujp>	If I could I wouldn't be stuck in this poo hole of a situation :(
Sep 07 17:35:47 <pppingme>	If you're the consultant or implementor, you very much can..  you tell the client that you're waiting on the vendor for a fix for a serious bug, you tell the vendor fix or refund/bye

Sep 09 09:22:10 <azonenberg>	the management card (216 MHz Cortex-M7, dedicated out of band gigabit ethernet port, and small FPGA for I/O glue etc) has been designed and ordered, i have ~100 blank boards since i plan to use them for other projects too
Sep 09 09:22:13 <SpiritHorse>	snappy: depends on what you want to do/achieve with them... fs.com has whiteboxes on lockdown but you need fu to run
Sep 09 09:22:30 <azonenberg>	one board has been assembled and tested and i wrote the beginning of the CLI for it
Sep 09 09:22:45 <SpiritHorse>	they aren't going to replace ASRs or MXs anytime soon if that's what you're asking
Sep 09 09:23:02 <azonenberg>	right now i'm in the process of designing the switch engine itself in the xilinx FPGA tools and simulating it
Sep 09 09:23:22 <azonenberg>	trying to pin down for sure exactly how much FPGA capacity I need so i can finalize the pinout and do the switch engine PCB
Sep 09 09:23:35 <azonenberg>	i hope to start work on the switch engine schematic around mid month
Sep 09 09:24:04 <azonenberg>	snappy: not interested, one of the goals of this project was to go back to basics and make a no-frills switching platform
Sep 09 09:24:26 <azonenberg>	even more so when i get to the next generation, with all 10G/40G ports, to replace my current nexus 3064x
Sep 09 09:24:28 <SpiritHorse>	news flash: industry wants frills
Sep 09 09:24:43 <azonenberg>	Nobody makes dumb, simple switches that just push packets at full line rate and don't do much to them
Sep 09 09:24:54 <azonenberg>	with just enough management that you can segment the network and debug problems
Sep 09 09:25:05 <azonenberg>	so TDR testing on all ports, ability to dump and edit the mac table, vlans, trunking, etc
Sep 09 09:25:06 <SpiritHorse>	you aren't going to design a switching platform in mom's basement that competes with multi billion dollar corporations
Sep 09 09:25:07 <azonenberg>	not much more than that
Sep 09 09:25:15 <azonenberg>	SpiritHorse: Yeah, but i'm not trying to
Sep 09 09:25:19 <SpiritHorse>	treat it as a learning experience, at best
Sep 09 09:25:22 <azonenberg>	i *want* simplicity
Sep 09 09:25:30 <azonenberg>	the attack surface of IOS/NX-OS is massive
Sep 09 09:25:50 <bhuddah>	you can always go with unmanaged switches. or simple management switches that don't have any layer3
Sep 09 09:26:15 <azonenberg>	bhuddah: My switch is going to be pure layer 2, the initial firmware won't even have STP although i will likely add that soon after the minimum functional firmware release
Sep 09 09:26:28 <azonenberg>	But yes it's also a learning experience, plus just a ton of fun
Sep 09 09:26:53 <SpiritHorse>	if you are honest in the FPGA routing space you should have your sights set a bit higher.  HFT, etc
Sep 09 09:26:55 <azonenberg>	For the subset of features that I actually need at home, i fully expect it will be competitive with a cisco
Sep 09 09:27:21 <azonenberg>	Spirit532: fintech isn't something i have any interest in
Sep 09 09:27:35 <snappy>	SpiritHorse: kind of, but not really
Sep 09 09:27:38 <azonenberg>	i'm doing this for fun, the design is on github and if somebody else wants to build one then great
Sep 09 09:27:47 <azonenberg>	But it's really just my project
Sep 09 09:27:52 <snappy>	most datacentres don't need all the telco shit that comes with router/switching equipment
Sep 09 09:28:05 <azonenberg>	Also https://www.antikernel.net/temp/newbench.jpg is hardly "mom's basement" :)
Sep 09 09:28:11 <snappy>	or weird qos nonsense
Sep 09 09:28:38 <SpiritHorse>	azonenberg: meh, too clean to be a real environ
Sep 09 09:28:44 <SpiritHorse>	but props for the photo op
Sep 09 09:28:48 <snappy>	but fb, goog, amazon, etc. are all doing CLOS fabrics with simple (custom) software
Sep 09 09:29:09 <azonenberg>	snappy: yeah, exactly - a lot of users dont need it or want it
Sep 09 09:29:18 <azonenberg>	Spirit532: i just moved into the new space and haven't even finished unpacking
Sep 09 09:29:23 <azonenberg>	setting up the soldering station was first priority
Sep 09 09:29:39 <azonenberg>	i still have a quarter mile of fiber sitting coiled up on various drops waiting to get pulled through conduit and tray to the network core
Sep 09 09:29:50 <azonenberg>	SpiritHorse: *
Sep 09 09:30:06 <azonenberg>	but rest assured i'm actually using it
Sep 09 09:30:52 <bhuddah>	it is an interesting project.
Sep 09 09:31:31 <azonenberg>	Well if anyone wants to see what makes it tick, https://github.com/azonenberg/latentpacket/
Sep 09 09:31:34 <snappy>	azonenberg: yeah i was keen to replicate, but i have none of the shit or pcb/circuit expertise to do so; if it was assemble a few components, jtag/flash some firmware, and dick around, that'd be fun
Sep 09 09:31:46 <azonenberg>	snappy: i'll be updating the channel with my progress
Sep 09 09:32:08 <azonenberg>	When it reaches the point that I have prototypes, i'll probably be selling off a handful of first-run boards at cost
Sep 09 09:32:22 <azonenberg>	Probably no enclosure, hand soldered and minimally tested, no guarantees whatsoever
Sep 09 09:32:31 <azonenberg>	Just to get more people playing with it
Sep 09 09:32:43 <snappy>	yep cool, be sure to use it for the core of our production network
Sep 09 09:32:44 <azonenberg>	It's an expensive enough project i can't give them away but i'd just charge the PCB+component cost, no profit
Sep 09 09:32:47 <azonenberg>	Lol
Sep 09 09:33:12 <azonenberg>	ideally i can actually get some folks to test and contribute patches or bug fixes
Sep 09 09:33:12 <snappy>	(reality: i haven't touched a network in yonks because of cloud shit)
Sep 09 09:34:21 <azonenberg>	There's going to be at least 3 different programmable chips in the system - the main switch engine FPGA, the smaller I/O expansion FPGA (both programmed in systemverilog), and the management CPU (almost all C++ with... five? lines of assembly in two helper functions)
Sep 09 09:34:24 <SpiritHorse>	https://i.imgur.com/03Z72bV.jpg
Sep 09 09:34:25 <SpiritHorse>	wat
Sep 09 09:34:43 <azonenberg>	i may also have some tiny micro or cpld or something on the switch engine board for power rail sequencing
Sep 09 09:35:45 <azonenberg>	SpiritHorse: that looks more like the lab bench at $dayjob on a good day. Lol
Sep 09 09:35:53 <azonenberg>	I've been trying to get them to tidy up :p
Sep 09 09:36:07 <SpiritHorse>	I really, really need to tidy
Sep 09 09:37:44 <azonenberg>	snappy: one big thing i need to work on, BTW, is the SSH interface for the management CPU
Sep 09 09:37:51 <azonenberg>	right now it's rs232 only, telnet wont be too hard
Sep 09 09:38:20 <azonenberg>	but i don't know of anyone who makes a SSHD that fits in my somewhat unique constraints - namely, 512 KB of total RAM and (per coding policy) no dynamic memory allocation
Sep 09 09:38:52 <azonenberg>	having a static sized pool of buffers or something would be fine
Sep 09 09:38:59 <earendil>	azonenberg: dang, and i thought having sshd running in 4mb of ram was tough
Sep 09 09:39:09 <azonenberg>	earendil: i'm also not running linux etc
Sep 09 09:39:14 <azonenberg>	or even using a normal RTOS
Sep 09 09:39:16 <bhuddah>	i think the smallest usual sshd is dropbear
Sep 09 09:39:19 <azonenberg>	this is C++ on bare metal
Sep 09 09:39:29 <earendil>	why C++ on bare metal that small
Sep 09 09:39:38 <earendil>	what kernel
Sep 09 09:39:43 <azonenberg>	No OS
Sep 09 09:40:25 <azonenberg>	i have a few ISRs that pull data from peripherals and shove them into ring buffers in RAM, then a main loop that checks for new events in the buffers and processes them (right now just keystrokes on the UART)
Sep 09 09:40:41 <azonenberg>	no recursive functions, bounded run time on everything
Sep 09 09:40:51 <azonenberg>	goal is to minimize the probability of a hang or crash
Sep 09 09:41:18 <azonenberg>	That being said, since the packet datapath is entirely in FPGA and the CPU is just a user interface, it should be possible to have the CPU crash and have the system keep forwarding packets
Sep 09 09:41:38 <azonenberg>	And have a watchdog timer and/or push button on the front of the unit that reloads the cpu *without causing any loss of network connectivity*
Sep 09 09:42:05 <azonenberg>	This is an explicit design requirement, you should be able to desolder the CPU live and have the worst problem be loss of management
Sep 09 09:42:17 <detha>	beware of initialisation routines - reboot control plane should not touch data plane, until it has read config etc.
Sep 09 09:42:34 <azonenberg>	detha: the CPU will be essentially stateless
Sep 09 09:42:44 <azonenberg>	any management commands will pull registers from FPGA then display them
Sep 09 09:42:53 <azonenberg>	the FPGA will have its own flash to store port vlan config, etc
Sep 09 09:43:15 <azonenberg>	so upon boot the FPGA will be doing its thing after a few hundred ms completely independent of the CPU
Sep 09 09:43:32 <azonenberg>	there'll just be a register you poke to push the current register config to flash, a la "copy run start"
Sep 09 09:43:38 <detha>	ok, so the fpga keeps running its config, and the cpu only updates it when told to. Nice
Sep 09 09:43:41 <azonenberg>	Correct
Sep 09 09:43:49 <azonenberg>	I'm explicitly trying to segment it that way for reliability
Sep 09 09:44:08 <azonenberg>	the goal is to have as few possible points of failure that can lead to loss of connectivity for the LAN
Sep 09 09:44:14 <azonenberg>	loss of management is a far less serious failure
Sep 09 09:44:22 <azonenberg>	as i often go several days without logging into one of my switches
Sep 09 09:44:29 <azonenberg>	i could have the CPU hang and not notice for a couple days :p
Sep 09 09:44:37 <azonenberg>	although ideally the FPGA would notice and reboot the CPU. Lol
Sep 09 09:44:43 <snappy>	azonenberg: so you need a bare metal tcp/ip stack before you can do ssh right?
Sep 09 09:44:45 <snappy>	(or telnet)
Sep 09 09:44:59 <detha>	s/days/weeks/. But I'd notice if SNMP was missin
Sep 09 09:45:04 <azonenberg>	snappy: correct, i have yet to decide how much of that will be software on the MCU and how much will be using my existing FPGA tcp offload engine
Sep 09 09:45:20 <azonenberg>	detha: yeah i should probably add SNMP at some point. Won't make initial firmware, "forwards packets" is about the one goal for that lol
Sep 09 09:45:36 <azonenberg>	The FPGA is going to be the brains of the system, then the CPU will basically be a management coprocessor
Sep 09 09:45:37 <snappy>	I'm guessing if the ESP8266 can do it, it shouldn't be difficult to do on MCU
Sep 09 09:45:46 <azonenberg>	snappy: oh i've done bare metal TCP in the past
Sep 09 09:45:58 <snappy>	but i don't know why you're using such a minimal MCU rather than a SoC
Sep 09 09:46:04 <detha>	I think the ESP32 dev environment has a plain C ssh implementation. And that stuff runs on 'bare metal'
Sep 09 09:46:07 <azonenberg>	snappy: simplicity and reliability
Sep 09 09:46:17 <azonenberg>	Also a STM32F777 is hardly a "minimal MCU"
Sep 09 09:46:32 <azonenberg>	but it's not a 12-core Cortex-A72
Sep 09 09:46:35 <earendil>	C++ and simplicity and reliability and limited resources, lol
Sep 09 09:46:51 <azonenberg>	earendil: if you don't use exceptions or RTTI, C++ is basically just prettier C
Sep 09 09:47:10 <azonenberg>	my firmware right now is 17 KB
Sep 09 09:47:15 <detha>	for some value of 'prettier'.
Sep 09 09:47:15 <earendil>	can be, depending on the compiler really
Sep 09 09:47:17 <snappy>	ah yeah that's pretty reasonable, i thought it was some anemic thing like an AVR
Sep 09 09:47:46 <azonenberg>	snappy: lol no. It's one of the nicest MCUs i could find that wasn't an apps processor
Sep 09 09:48:06 <azonenberg>	Almost all cortex-A platforms need external RAM which adds to PCB cost and layout complexity, bigger footprints, more pins, etc
Sep 09 09:48:19 <azonenberg>	they're also a pain to run bare metal and i really didnt want to put linux on the thing as that's just a lot more complexity than i need
Sep 09 09:48:52 <snappy>	i'm not too knowledgable about embedded world; do you expect ot have a thin OS around this, or how will things be scheduled in the MCU (assuming it has multiple responsibilities)
Sep 09 09:49:09 <azonenberg>	The MCU is just management, and it's going to be all event driven
Sep 09 09:49:24 <azonenberg>	the main loop will sleep until an interrupt happens, then wake up and process an incoming packet or something, then sleep again
Sep 09 09:49:31 <snappy>	ah ok
Sep 09 09:49:40 <azonenberg>	all cooperative, no pre-emption or timer interrupt
Sep 09 09:49:43 <azonenberg>	no context switching
Sep 09 09:50:08 <azonenberg>	Which means you have to bound the run time of each event handler, but if you keep things simple that isn't too hard
Sep 09 09:51:29 <detha>	lotsa polling though
Sep 09 09:52:16 <detha>	means you can't put the CPU in low-power mode
Sep 09 09:52:26 <azonenberg>	detha: not polling exactly
Sep 09 09:52:39 <azonenberg>	the CPU will be in full on sleep mode waiting until an interrupt happens
Sep 09 09:52:53 <azonenberg>	once an interrupt happens the main loop will wake up, check the necessary flags, call the relevant handlers, then sleep
Sep 09 09:53:07 <azonenberg>	unless another interrupt happened while that one was in progress, in which case it'll handle that event too
Sep 09 09:53:34 <azonenberg>	Right now it's busy-polling just because i haven't added a "if no pending events sleep" call to the loop
Sep 09 09:53:41 <azonenberg>	but that's an optimization i'll do later
Sep 09 09:55:03 <detha>	that part of the code gets hairy; it fixes it self if you miss an interrupt, i.e. it will handle it the next time something else happens, but there be dragons
Sep 09 09:55:05 <azonenberg>	basically just add to latentred/firmware/main.cpp:66 "DisableInterrupts(); if(!any events pending) sleep and wait for interrupt / else EnableInterrupts();
Sep 09 09:55:20 <azonenberg>	ISRs will always fire as soon as they happen and push data into ring buffers
Sep 09 09:55:28 <azonenberg>	the polling just checks if there's new data in the ring buffer
Sep 09 09:56:14 <detha>	and locking between main loop and ISRs ?
Sep 09 09:57:37 <azonenberg>	Of course. Not that locks are too hard on something this low level: disable interrupts, check flag, re-enable
Sep 09 09:59:55 <detha>	never done that low-level on ARM, but I'm pretty sure there are test-and-set or exch like instructions for it
Sep 09 10:11:42 <Phil-Work>	I'm sure the answer is, as ever, "it depends" but how big in terms of geographical distance should an OSPF area be? :S
Sep 09 10:12:38 <Phil-Work>	assuming < 100 routers, is there anything technically wrong with a single area spanning the whole world?
Sep 09 10:13:55 *	ChanServ gives voice to sep
Sep 09 10:17:32 <detha>	I'd say an OSPF area is a logical area, not a physical area. And how big you make your logical area depends more on 'how many updates per time period' then number of nodes
Sep 09 10:18:23 <detha>	Stable network, no problem. Something like a wireless network with links flapping all the time, you start spending an awful amount of CPU on processing updates
Sep 09 10:20:25 <earendil>	i'm not sure i've seen anything like that in actual use either. usually its tied in with bgp somehow, or over VPNs or MPLS or whatever
Sep 09 10:20:46 <earendil>	debatable at that point if its a "single span"
Sep 09 10:22:24 <Phil-Work>	earendil, this is what I'm wondering - because MPLS inherently relies on the IGP, especially if you're doing TE
Sep 09 10:23:38 <Phil-Work>	bridging MPLS areas with BGP makes some sense though I'm not sure of the semantics of doing MPLS over that
Sep 09 10:25:21 <earendil>	Phil-Work: usually with MPLS i've seen it being OSPF, but i never got that far down into the weeds, as i was usually fixing something border related
Sep 09 10:25:29 <earendil>	also, MPLS is a four letter word
Sep 09 10:32:15 <lordofthekebabs>	hello, I kinda got intersted in networking and I was wondering how would I develop a web server If a wanted to develop one.  Do not get me wrong I am not asking you to tell me which components I should include or research I think that I will achieve that once I read more on networking tcp iso/models ... etc. But, I started gathering resources on
Sep 09 10:32:16 <lordofthekebabs>	more of a birdeye view of the networking subject such as teaching me Communucation models, tcp, ip, iso ... etc. and I do not think the books will go really in detail about the source(web server) I want to build with c++
Sep 09 10:32:58 <lordofthekebabs>	do you have any reccomendation to how to learn about building a web server after reading a couple of books on networking
Sep 09 10:59:13 <tsujp>	Hi everyone. I have a VM machine and a dedicated machine. The dedicated machine is going to run my stuff, and I am going to use the VM with a failover IP so that I can present to the world this static subnet my stuff will be available on. How do I connect the VM to the dedicated machine?
Sep 09 10:59:17 <tsujp>	gre6 tunnel? Wireguard?
Sep 09 10:59:38 <grawity>	any L2 or L3 tunnel/vpn should work
Sep 09 11:00:36 <tsujp>	Would the VM need to be powerful to support this?
Sep 09 11:00:38 <grawity>	Wireguard would be the simplest option, although I still use GRE/IPsec
Sep 09 11:00:42 <tsujp>	As in the network traffic
Sep 09 11:00:54 <tsujp>	Say.. 10 gigabytes of total in out over 24 hours
Sep 09 11:01:08 <tsujp>	Something like 2 vCPU with 1 or 2 GB of memory would be fine?
Sep 09 11:01:13 <grawity>	should be fine
Sep 09 11:01:28 <SpiritHorse>	GRE? 2019? good stuff.
Sep 09 11:01:30 <grawity>	I'd say it's more about peak Mbps
Sep 09 11:01:35 <tsujp>	You mention GRE/IPsec, gre6 would be the one I'd use then eh?
Sep 09 11:01:44 <grawity>	"10 GB / 24 hours" on average could be handled by a potato
Sep 09 11:02:05 <grawity>	it's barely 1 Mbps
Sep 09 11:02:09 <earendil>	hah
Sep 09 11:02:12 <tsujp>	Gotcha lmfao
Sep 09 11:02:39 <tsujp>	I've heard Wireguard isn't production ready yet, I plan to have around 1000-2000 tunnels going on here, that is a public IP on the VM to a private IP on the dedicated
Sep 09 11:02:51 <grawity>	as for gre vs gre6, if you're doing it in Linux, the difference is what protocol the tunnel *runs on top of*
Sep 09 11:02:55 <tsujp>	Given a potato can handle the network _speed_ what about the process maintaining such tunnels?
Sep 09 11:03:01 <grawity>	but both gre and gre6 interfaces can carry IPv4+IPv6 simultaneously
Sep 09 11:03:21 <tsujp>	Well the protocol in use would be IPv4 and IPv6 only, or am I missing something there?
Sep 09 11:03:28 <grawity>	what kind of maintenance do you have in mind?
Sep 09 11:03:45 <tsujp>	Minimal possible
Sep 09 11:03:54 <grawity>	ah, from the sysadmin PoV?
Sep 09 11:04:10 <tsujp>	I'll be writing scripts and services to watch if the VM goes down and if it does I'll slam a new one up and copy the rules over and the failover IP such that everything continues ticking along
Sep 09 11:04:26 <tsujp>	And the reverse if a dedicated host goes down, scripts to remake any tunnels required to their new private IP
Sep 09 11:04:46 <tsujp>	I'm more concerned about the machine resources required to keep all the tunnels open without incident
Sep 09 11:04:58 <grawity>	the machine doesn't need much
Sep 09 11:05:26 <tsujp>	Roger
Sep 09 11:05:28 <azonenberg>	Is this for takedown-resistant hosting or something?
Sep 09 11:05:34 <grawity>	it could sit there for *years* forwarding the packets
Sep 09 11:05:55 <azonenberg>	or DDOS protection?
Sep 09 11:06:04 <tsujp>	It's a bastardised blend between wanting things with a static IP but also using containerisation azonenberg
Sep 09 11:06:17 <realtime>	hello. how two hosts connect directly when neither is able to open a port to be the 'host'?
Sep 09 11:06:28 <tsujp>	So my host already handles the DDoS protection for me, but my containerised services need to present to the world their availability on a static IP for maximal ease-out-us
Sep 09 11:06:30 <azonenberg>	realtime: directly? you don't :p
Sep 09 11:06:33 <grawity>	realtime: like when both are behind NATs?
Sep 09 11:06:36 <tsujp>	else I have to do a few DNS messarounds which I'd rather not do
Sep 09 11:06:41 <azonenberg>	Normally this is solved by bouncing through a proxy somewhere they can both reach
Sep 09 11:06:55 <grawity>	realtime: there are "NAT traversal" / "NAT hole punching" mechanisms which *sometimes* work, depending on NAT type
Sep 09 11:06:59 <grawity>	same for firewalls
Sep 09 11:07:07 <tsujp>	I am using ip6tables for most of my routing, so I shall look into gre6 and wireguard
Sep 09 11:07:12 <realtime>	azonenberg, so, if I'm playying a game, and I know neither me nor my friend can open a port because of out routers (technically we can, but for the sake of hypothesis), how do we are able to play a game?
Sep 09 11:07:18 <grawity>	ip6tables doesn't do routing, technically speaking
Sep 09 11:07:20 <tsujp>	What are some good tools to benchmark load of these things on my VM forward machine?
Sep 09 11:07:35 <tsujp>	Oh, what does it do (ip6tables? NAT right?)
Sep 09 11:07:40 <grawity>	set up the tunnel, run iperf3 to measure bandwidth, then just look at CPU usage while it's running
Sep 09 11:07:44 <azonenberg>	realtime: sometimes you can bounce through nats using UDP
Sep 09 11:07:50 <grawity>	(and it's going to be mostly CPU, not memory and definitely not disk)
Sep 09 11:08:02 <azonenberg>	if both ping out using the opposite source/dest port pairing
Sep 09 11:08:11 <grawity>	imho, first check how easy or difficult it is to install Wireguard on your distro – if they offer a DKMS package or even a pre-built module, that's your easiest option
Sep 09 11:08:13 <realtime>	grawity, yes, behind NAts. i dont really need a solution, I know how to open a port. but I didn't and my friend doesn't even know what I was talking about, so I know he didn't. but we played.
Sep 09 11:08:29 <azonenberg>	the other possibility, as i mentioned, is that it's proxying through some server somewhere
Sep 09 11:08:42 <grawity>	GRE/IPSec has a slight advantage of being able to use AES-NI (whereas Wireguard's ChaCha20 cannot), but ... not much of a difference
Sep 09 11:09:04 <realtime>	azonenberg, yes, first thing I thought was that a server was being the intermediary... and that UPD technique has a name so I can look up and lkarn it better?
Sep 09 11:09:14 <grawity>	realtime: many game services include NAT traversal mechanisms, e.g. Xbox uses Teredo
Sep 09 11:11:46 <realtime>	well, isn't this relay the same as 'there's a server acting as an intermediary'? -> Teredo routes these datagrams on the IPv4 Internet and through NAT devices. Teredo nodes elsewhere on the IPv6 network (called Teredo relays) receive the packets, un-encapsulate them, and pass them on.
Sep 09 11:11:59 <redsh>	grawity: I thought the speeds were fairly similar regardless though, for AES and chacha20?
Sep 09 11:12:05 <grawity>	I think they are
Sep 09 11:12:30 <grawity>	realtime: some mechanisms don't use a relay for data, only for the initial connection
Sep 09 11:12:59 <grawity>	realtime: e.g. STUN lets both sides discover what pair of ports the other side uses, so that both NATs *think* they're handling an outbound connection to the other node
Sep 09 11:13:10 <azonenberg>	grawity: yeah thats the technique i was thinking of
Sep 09 11:13:13 <azonenberg>	i couldn't remember the name of it
Sep 09 11:14:19 <realtime>	hmm interesting... so an UDP datagram doesn't need the same system of client/host-with-open-port?
Sep 09 11:14:21 <realtime>	why?
Sep 09 11:14:35 <grawity>	it does
Sep 09 11:14:45 <tsujp>	Cheers grawity I'll give that stuff a shot
Sep 09 11:15:10 <realtime>	so how does the 'handshake' (or whatever is called) occurs to begin with?
Sep 09 11:15:19 <realtime>	okay I'll check this STUN before bothering you guys more
Sep 09 11:15:42 <grawity>	when both sides have some way of agreeing what to send (let's say they both contact the same SteamXboxPS4 server), they can both send packets to trick their respective NAT gateways into opening up the connection in both directions
Sep 09 11:17:50 <realtime>	hmmm, so, yet again, a third server has to help to get things going, right?
Sep 09 11:17:53 <realtime>	no magic at all
Sep 09 11:18:02 <grawity>	generally yes
Sep 09 11:18:09 <realtime>	yeah, got it
Sep 09 11:18:33 <realtime>	thanks, guise! :)
Sep 09 11:19:23 <azonenberg>	The difference is, once the connection is set up
Sep 09 11:19:29 <azonenberg>	the future communication is peer to peer
Sep 09 11:19:34 <azonenberg>	So lower latency
Sep 09 11:20:26 <grawity>	well, a third server is needed for both sides to find out about each other's existence in the first place
Sep 09 11:47:49 <PerryHugh>	Hello, I'm trying to understand where Medium Access Control actually is. Is it located on the Network Interface Controller? I read the MAC Address is located there so it seems so, but does that put the NIC at OSI level 1 and 2?
Sep 09 11:50:12 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Well it depends on the protocol actually.
Sep 09 11:50:13 <PerryHugh>	I'm kind of presuming that MAC is distributed among different chips in systems like cell phones that have USB, WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular connection.
Sep 09 11:50:29 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Ethernet itself is a layer 1+2 protocol (it spans physical modulation as well as link-layer responsibilities)
Sep 09 11:50:46 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: So in a regular ethernet NIC you would find both the PHY and the MAC on the NIC
Sep 09 11:51:32 <djph>	PerryHugh: well, each of those connectivities have their own Media Access Control (if any).
Sep 09 11:52:44 <PerryHugh>	That makes sense, so in the case of ethernet as it's actually the topic of research, when a connection is first created between two devices, how is the MAC Address of the opposing station discovered? I know how ARP requests are structured and I'm aware of broadcast signals, but they require an IP to be requested, I'm not aware of a "whoever I just
Sep 09 11:52:45 <PerryHugh>	connected to's" IP.
Sep 09 11:52:45 <wallbroken>	hi
Sep 09 11:52:57 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Very roughly, the kernel communicates with your NICs MAC, and the MAC communicates with some PHY.
Sep 09 11:53:01 <wallbroken>	somebody knows if an USIM could be also 64k ?
Sep 09 11:53:45 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: (In reality this are rather complicated because Im ignoring the LLC here)
Sep 09 11:55:14 <djph>	PerryHugh: when you link two machines, they only negotiate link-layer stuff (e.g. fast ethernet, full duplex, "oh, that end is Txing to my Tx, I'd better apply MDI-X"
Sep 09 11:56:18 <PerryHugh>	I presume you mean physical layer? I thought MAC was in the link layer, particularly a sub layer of it.
Sep 09 11:56:30 <djph>	er... make that the physical.  Data Link, while its important, doesn't come into play there.
Sep 09 11:56:35 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: In case of ethernet we can pretend MAC to make up the entirety of its layer.
Sep 09 11:56:41 <djph>	^
Sep 09 11:56:59 <wallbroken>	nobody have an idea?
Sep 09 11:57:16 <PerryHugh>	Makes sense, in that case how is the MAC even obtained. At this point there is no IP address known of the newly connected ethernet device.
Sep 09 11:57:28 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Dont conflate MAC with "MAC address"
Sep 09 11:57:45 <PerryHugh>	Right, mistype actually.
Sep 09 11:57:49 <PerryHugh>	Mac Address*
Sep 09 11:59:20 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: The MAC address can be configured on the MAC.
Sep 09 11:59:30 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: By default vendors ship their devices with pre-configured MAC addresses.
Sep 09 11:59:39 <dminuoso>	Which is, hopefully, globally unique.
Sep 09 11:59:42 <dminuoso>	(Or at least unique enough)
Sep 09 11:59:46 <djph>	^
Sep 09 12:00:31 <djph>	I remember in the bad old days, companies using the same MACs every Nth machine or so (or on every machine).  Got really shitty if you bought >N
Sep 09 12:00:32 <PerryHugh>	So the NIC will send a frame containing some MAC protocol packet that has information such as the MAC address and it is expected the new device responds with the same information? If so, which protocol?
Sep 09 12:00:40 <djph>	no.
Sep 09 12:00:46 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: The kernel communicates with the MAC.
Sep 09 12:02:18 <PerryHugh>	I'm still not seeing how the kernal would even get the MAC address of the newly connected device.
Sep 09 12:02:32 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Broadcasts.
Sep 09 12:02:59 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: There's various discovery protocols that simply broadcast information across the entire L2 domain.
Sep 09 12:02:59 <PerryHugh>	Right, but which protocol? ARP requires an IP address to compare, which we don't have.
Sep 09 12:04:41 <djph>	it just broadcasts
Sep 09 12:05:00 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Depends on the protocol really.
Sep 09 12:05:10 <djph>	"hi this is $local_mac  sending to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, who's am I talking to?"
Sep 09 12:05:44 <djph>	OR you already know it, so you just tell your machine "hey, talk to MAC 00:12:34:56:78:9A"
Sep 09 12:05:56 <dminuoso>	12:02:59       PerryHugh | Right, but which protocol? ARP requires an IP address to compare, which we don't have.
Sep 09 12:06:00 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: What exactly are you talking about?
Sep 09 12:06:08 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Do you have a specific situation?
Sep 09 12:06:17 <PerryHugh>	I don't, I'm just trying to learn.
Sep 09 12:06:25 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Oh I think I figured out your mistake!
Sep 09 12:06:32 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: L2 doesn't give rise to connections.
Sep 09 12:07:10 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: L2 is about sending lose frames to either a) a specific mac address or b) the entire domain
Sep 09 12:07:23 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: The latter is how ARP works. Its what makes IP work.
Sep 09 12:07:57 <earendil>	hrm, is ARP actually necessary for things like BOOTP and PXE booting
Sep 09 12:08:14 <PerryHugh>	What I mean is, the ethernet adapter connects to another device, some frames must be sent to establish the connection, but in order to transmit any data over the NIC a MAC address is necessary, I know of ARP as a way of getting a local mac address via IP, but how do you get this new device's mac address without knowing it's IP?
Sep 09 12:08:16 <djph>	earendil: probably
Sep 09 12:08:24 <PerryHugh>	Ah
Sep 09 12:08:32 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: There is no real connection.
Sep 09 12:08:34 <dogbert2>	hey djph
Sep 09 12:08:41 <djph>	PerryHugh: no, there are no "frames" to establish that communication.  It's all just various link-pulses.
Sep 09 12:08:43 <PerryHugh>	So, ARP would say "broadcasting to all IPs, give me your IP and MAC address?
Sep 09 12:08:51 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Not to all IPs.
Sep 09 12:08:53 <djph>	heyo dogbert2
Sep 09 12:08:56 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: To all L2 devices on the domain.
Sep 09 12:09:01 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: There are no IP addresses at this layer.
Sep 09 12:09:03 <dogbert2>	whazzup?
Sep 09 12:09:06 <earendil>	PerryHugh: broadcast is the key, as a convention that ethernet will typically honor
Sep 09 12:09:18 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: An IP address, from the perspective of L2, is just some imaginative thing. Question is, how would you implement IP addresses with just ethernet?
Sep 09 12:09:24 <Emperorpenguin>	PerryHugh: no ARp goes "yo who's 192.168.3.4?"
Sep 09 12:09:24 <dminuoso>	We need to mimic it somehow.
Sep 09 12:09:35 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: We do this by having a way to translate IP addresses into MAC addresses.
Sep 09 12:09:55 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: And we translate them by braodcasting into the entire domain "Who here believes he is 192.168.3.4? Please tell me your MAC address"
Sep 09 12:10:10 <PerryHugh>	Which creates a table, I understand that facet
Sep 09 12:10:23 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Right! ANd that *which* that creates the table and association, thats the IP stack.
Sep 09 12:10:32 <Emperorpenguin>	it's like if you have a package to deliver to John in "room 3b", you go to room 3b and ask "who's John?"
Sep 09 12:10:46 <djph>	he raises his hand.
Sep 09 12:10:46 <Emperorpenguin>	then you associate the name to the face and deliver the packet
Sep 09 12:10:47 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: IP is basically something that controls L2 frames.
Sep 09 12:10:51 <earendil>	i've always disliked the OSI layer model
Sep 09 12:11:03 <PerryHugh>	I mean, if you don't have an IP address at all, so you can't go through ARP, but you want to send data over ethernet, how does that work?
Sep 09 12:11:03 <earendil>	looking at ARP in detail is one of those reasons heh
Sep 09 12:11:10 <earendil>	PerryHugh: broadcast
Sep 09 12:11:14 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: This whole model of "IP is inside Ethernet" is a poor mindmodel, because in reality IP is an abstraction where we send L2 frames with some particular pattern.
Sep 09 12:11:37 <earendil>	PerryHugh: spam it to everyone, in a convention that's routinely honored, and eventually someone will get the message
Sep 09 12:11:45 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: IP specifies when to send which ether frames.
Sep 09 12:11:52 <djph>	heh, it's like IRC :P
Sep 09 12:11:53 <dminuoso>	(Or strictly speaking not even ether)
Sep 09 12:11:58 <PerryHugh>	Okay, it's making some more sense. So there would have to be individual NICs for every single ethernet port right?
Sep 09 12:12:06 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Nope.
Sep 09 12:12:38 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: This is where things become sort of complicated for a lot of reasons.
Sep 09 12:13:22 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: But for the sake of discussion we could pretend that RJ45 ports have a 1-to-1 correspondence to MACs.
Sep 09 12:13:34 <dminuoso>	Its not true, but I think it simplifies the discussion.
Sep 09 12:14:07 <redsh>	Definitely not true on my router :P
Sep 09 12:14:39 <earendil>	in practice for simple cases, it is true. but that's why networking is such a bitch... the edge and corner cases get fucking murky *really* fast
Sep 09 12:14:54 <earendil>	where fanciful models meet reality
Sep 09 12:15:19 <PerryHugh>	Okay, so the kernal will submit a broadcast through the NIC through some protocol asking what the MAC Address is of the other computer, after it receives that how does it create an IP from it for applications to use, in essence how does the reverse of ARP happen?
Sep 09 12:15:25 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: No.
Sep 09 12:16:11 <earendil>	PerryHugh: look at PXE booting and DHCP?
Sep 09 12:16:45 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: IP addresses are not a resource to be "created"
Sep 09 12:17:09 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: An IP address is sort of a "name for a mac address", quite similar to how DNS gives names for IP addresses (and more)
Sep 09 12:17:34 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: At least thats how it acts in case of stacking IP ontop of Ethernet.
Sep 09 12:18:01 <PerryHugh>	I've read the RFC for DHCP a while back and have my notes on it. But I wasn't aware it is something that operates on all device to device connections. I thought this was just a protocol for routers and switches.
Sep 09 12:18:18 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: So connecthing things to a L2 hub is how you create a network. Things can all talk to each other, but this lacks one thing: the ability to connect multiple networks together with the ability to route between them.
Sep 09 12:18:28 <dminuoso>	(Lets ignore switches, we dont need them. They are just an optimization feature)
Sep 09 12:20:35 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: So the way IP works, is by assigning fictive addresses to hosts. But since we defined ethernet to work with broadcasts and mac addresses, we need to somehow transform this IP behavior into ethernet frames. So the IP stack has to know that "sending a package to 1.2.3.4 means sending the frame to aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff", it does this by ARP. Once the IP stack has learned the mac address, it will send
Sep 09 12:20:37 <dminuoso>	all "1.2.3.4" packages to aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
Sep 09 12:22:02 <dminuoso>	The ether frame will further have its ether type set accordingly, so the other stack knows to interpret the content/payload of this as an IP packet. Once it arrives there, the IP stack will take this piece, and potentially route it further (which itself might cause ARP again, since it might have to send that package onto another device on some L2 domain)
Sep 09 12:23:51 <dminuoso>	L2 Ethernet is about sending data between hosts on a network. IP is about connecting networks together (so strictly speaking, if you were just on a single local network, IP doesn't really give you many benefits on its own)
Sep 09 12:25:10 <earendil>	reminds me of the bad ol' days when we were directly connecting computers with serial and even parallel ports for "networking"
Sep 09 12:26:11 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: The main point of IP is not ARP, its routing!
Sep 09 12:26:22 <dminuoso>	ARP is merely the technology that lets you run IP ontop of Ethernet.
Sep 09 12:26:41 <dminuoso>	If you ran IP on something else, you wouldnt need ARP.
Sep 09 12:27:32 <PerryHugh>	So MAC Addresses are used to narrow down frames from being broadcasts (which is itself a specific MAC address), to a specific device. The way a MAC address is obtained is from ARP which sends a broadcast message out with a specific higher level IP address requesting if anyone else is using that IP address (as assigned by DHCP), if so it get back a
Sep 09 12:27:33 <PerryHugh>	MAC address and puts it in a table so any further requests to that IP go to that MAC address directly. In effect reiterating, is this correct so far?
Sep 09 12:27:57 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Sounds about right, yes.
Sep 09 12:27:57 <PerryHugh>	gets*
Sep 09 12:28:19 <earendil>	ARP has been used with other networking protocols that aren't IP heh
Sep 09 12:28:36 <dminuoso>	earendil: Im really trying to not be overly pedantic here. :p
Sep 09 12:29:07 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Strictly speaking, you could avoid ARP by sending every packet via braodcast too...
Sep 09 12:29:36 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: It wouldn't be very effective though, since the bigger your network gets, the less everyone can talk.
Sep 09 12:29:51 <PerryHugh>	In this case, IP Addresses and MAC Addresses actually aren't necessary until a higher level application attempts to use or establish a connection, so the ethernet controller itself will connect and L2 won't necessarily have to even be invoked (though I'm sure it is as network discovery is common)?
Sep 09 12:30:00 <dminuoso>	So ARP is used by IP to *efficiently* sent packets only to the hosts that need them.
Sep 09 12:30:15 <PerryHugh>	(That makes sense.)
Sep 09 12:30:49 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: (And interestingly, this is only a useful thing to do if you have a switch instead of a hub)
Sep 09 12:31:38 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: I dont fully understand that sentence
Sep 09 12:32:13 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: MAC addresses are the way how hosts talk to each other (broadcasts arent meant for that, so my remark there was a bit silly). They are needed the moment you want host-to-host communication over ethernet.
Sep 09 12:32:38 <dminuoso>	IP addresses are the way you talk to hosts on different networks (where you cant do broadcast discovery, because well they are on a different network!)
Sep 09 12:33:14 <PerryHugh>	So, lets say you have an isolated computer and connect it to another computer. When you do, is there some kind of DHCP application that is run to create IP addresses for each other to simplify transmission? Or is everything broadcast until a router gets involved?
Sep 09 12:33:16 <dminuoso>	And even if you did know their MAC address, it wouldnt do you any good because you are not on the same network as them.
Sep 09 12:33:46 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: IP addresses are not really "created"
Sep 09 12:34:13 <PerryHugh>	Well, within the local subnet they are offered, which has a sort of manufacturing to it.
Sep 09 12:34:27 *	redsh creates 753.292.13.54
Sep 09 12:34:43 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: When a new street is created named "Baker St", would you say that the name "Baker St" was *created/manufactured* ?
Sep 09 12:34:46 <PerryHugh>	More, distributed if we're being accurate.
Sep 09 12:34:51 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: Or would you say it was "chosen/assigned" ?
Sep 09 12:35:05 <Gh0st>	Hi
Sep 09 12:35:10 <Gh0st>	can I post a link to a website here?
Sep 09 12:35:21 <Gh0st>	I have a question about it
Sep 09 12:35:46 <Gh0st>	Looking Glass Threats
Sep 09 12:36:07 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: So do you accept that IP is for having cross-network connectivity?
Sep 09 12:36:14 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: (Ill get to your question in a moment)
Sep 09 12:36:17 <PerryHugh>	Yes
Sep 09 12:36:29 <Gh0st>	https://map.lookingglasscyber.com/
Sep 09 12:36:31 <detha>	dminuoso: when ipv6 came around, suddenly 2^128 IP addresses were created. That's the last time in known history
Sep 09 12:37:01 <Gh0st>	It says Live attack, what does that mean?
Sep 09 12:37:17 <redsh>	I came up with IPv12 and now there are 3^69 new addresses.
Sep 09 12:37:27 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: DHCP is about assigning an IP address to your computer, such that your computer can automatically participate in cross-network communication
Sep 09 12:37:32 <PerryHugh>	True, assigned. I'm just trying to figure out how the OS gets a MAC address in the first place. I understand broadcasts are used when you don't have a specific MAC Address, the specificity comes in for efficiency, but at what point does the computer actually push through the request for a MAC address?
Sep 09 12:37:40 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: The OS doesnt get it.
Sep 09 12:37:52 <redsh>	There's generally one burned into the NIC.
Sep 09 12:37:53 <dminuoso>	PerryHugh: The MAC address is configured directly in the MAC of your NIC.
Sep 09 12:38:09 <redsh>	The OS can generally say "use this one instead" though, I think?
Sep 09 12:38:22 <PerryHugh>	Sure, OS has an IP which is mapped in ARP which is on your NIC to an external (internal network) device.
Sep 09 12:38:29 <PerryHugh>	When does that request actually happen though?
Sep 09 12:38:42 <redsh>	As long as the NIC/firmware supports it, which it generally does except on some wireless cards.
Sep 09 12:40:09 <PerryHugh>	But I know that's not right because I've used applications which request a MAC address to connect to, so I know the OS can deal with MAC addresses. You can even view your ARP table
Sep 09 12:40:24 <PerryHugh>	arp -a on linux
Sep 09 12:40:32 <redsh>	ip neigh
Sep 09 12:41:17 <PerryHugh>	So the ARP table must be at least accessible by the OS. I am not really concerned with any of that though. I just don't understand how the ARP table even gets populated in the first place.
Sep 09 12:42:09 <djph>	PerryHugh: by using ARP
Sep 09 12:42:12 <PerryHugh>	What broadcast message says "Hey give me your MAC address" And how is that connected to an IP address, which happens first, does the IP get assigned and then a MAC address gets asked for?
Sep 09 12:42:19 <redsh>	I thought it was the OS itself keeping track of the ARP table.
Sep 09 12:42:28 <PerryHugh>	I thought so too redsh
Sep 09 12:42:33 <redsh>	ARP is "who has 192.168.1.5? tell 192.168.1.4"
Sep 09 12:42:49 <PerryHugh>	Right, but if you don't have an IP address to ask for, you can't do that.
Sep 09 12:43:01 <djph>	PerryHugh: your PC sends a broadcast message " FROM (local mac address) TO (ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff) -- 'Who has $IP Address? Tell me.' "
Sep 09 12:43:33 <PerryHugh>	So two computers get connected via ethernet, neither are inherently imbued with an IP address but both are with a MAC address. How is the IP assigned to each so they can even use ARP to get each other's MAC address?
Sep 09 12:43:43 <detha>	by hand
Sep 09 12:43:49 <djph>	then the reply is " FROM 00-12-34-56-78-9A TO (original sender" -- I have $IP."
Sep 09 12:44:17 <Mibd>	what happens when 2 have same mac and same ip ?
Sep 09 12:44:18 <redsh>	DHCP is used to assign IP addresses.
Sep 09 12:44:18 <djph>	PerryHugh: generally it'd be DHCP.  But you can of course use static assignments on each machine.
Sep 09 12:44:22 <detha>	If there is no dhcp server involved, you set two arbitrary IP addresses on the computers
Sep 09 12:44:27 <djph>	Mibd: then your network is fucked.
Sep 09 12:44:43 <PerryHugh>	I understand how it works once you actually *have* the IP address of the other machine, I just don't understand how you even get that.
Sep 09 12:44:46 <redsh>	You're not supposed to really have the same MAC or IP address in multiple places on the same network.
Sep 09 12:44:54 <djph>	Mibd: and you should fire either $vendor or $admin.
Sep 09 12:45:03 <djph>	(or both)
Sep 09 12:45:06 <redsh>	PerryHugh: You use broadcast messages for DHCP.
Sep 09 12:45:10 <Mibd>	1 can be attacker
Sep 09 12:45:15 <Mibd>	2 legit
Sep 09 12:45:17 <redsh>	So you don't need to know any IP or MAC addresses.
Sep 09 12:45:22 <PerryHugh>	Okay DHCP, that makes sense. But how is the host determined?
Sep 09 12:45:29 <redsh>	The host?
Sep 09 12:45:33 <redsh>	Oh, MAC address.
Sep 09 12:45:33 <djph>	The host?
Sep 09 12:45:39 <PerryHugh>	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
Sep 09 12:45:40 <redsh>	... I think?
Sep 09 12:45:46 <wallbroken>	somebody knows if an USIM could be also 64k ?
Sep 09 12:45:53 <djph>	PerryHugh: "Host" is any machine on the network.
Sep 09 12:45:56 <PerryHugh>	The host is the one that offers.
Sep 09 12:45:56 <redsh>	Can't remember the specifics of the handshake any more .-.
Sep 09 12:46:06 <djph>	PerryHugh: the one that requests (DHCP server offers)
Sep 09 12:46:50 <redsh>	PerryHugh: Look, a good example with source/destination addresses too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol#Operation
Sep 09 12:46:58 <PerryHugh>	Client broadcasts, host offers an ip and config settings, client requests the offered IP/settings, host sends acknowledgment.
Sep 09 12:47:01 <djph>	Host -> server (discover) / Server -> host (Offer) / host -> server (request) / server -> host (ACK)
Sep 09 12:47:06 <detha>	PC to broadcast: 'gimme an IP'. DHCP server to PC: 'would you like 1.2.3.4?' PC to DHCP server: 'gimme 1.2.3.4?' DHCP server to PC 'you can have 1.2.3.4 for an hour'
Sep 09 12:48:37 <PerryHugh>	Ah, I'm saying host instead of server. Alright corrected terminology, how do the two newly connected computers running their DHCP software determine which is the server and which is the client?
Sep 09 12:48:50 <djph>	they don't
Sep 09 12:49:07 <PerryHugh>	Than I don't understand how DHCP would function between them o.o
Sep 09 12:49:14 <djph>	The DHCP Server is an application running on a machine.
Sep 09 12:49:35 <PerryHugh>	Right
Sep 09 12:49:50 <djph>	Do you happen to live in an apartment building (or have ever lived in one)? or perhaps a condo, or a HOA-infested development?
Sep 09 12:49:58 <PerryHugh>	Yes
Sep 09 12:50:12 <PerryHugh>	I know the router is running server software for it
Sep 09 12:50:24 <djph>	Ok, so your super / manager / whatever is "Mr. Super", and lives in Apartment 3A, right?
Sep 09 12:50:49 <PerryHugh>	I think I see my error.
Sep 09 12:51:08 <djph>	There's nothing special about 3A (equivalent of the HOST), but the person (software) inside of it is what's special.
Sep 09 12:51:39 <PerryHugh>	Two computers can't just work IP assignment out, one of them has to launch the special server software for it to even work.
Sep 09 12:51:59 <redsh>	Yes. There's a specific DHCP server.
Sep 09 12:52:00 <djph>	Correct.
Sep 09 12:52:09 <PerryHugh>	Makes a ton more sense now.
Sep 09 12:52:46 <djph>	Now, you ( PerryHugh ) being the admin of these machines can just come by and say "machine 1, you're 192.168.1.100; and machine_2, you're 192.168.1.103"
Sep 09 12:54:10 <PerryHugh>	Two computers connect to each other via ethernet, they can broadcast to each other but there is no associate MAC address yet.  One computer launches DHCP server software and the other launches DHCP client software, then broadcast messages are used to assign IP addresses to both computers. At this point ARP messages can be sent to determine each
Sep 09 12:54:11 <PerryHugh>	other's MAC Addresses and update an ARP table for more efficient communication.
Sep 09 12:54:26 <PerryHugh>	associated*
Sep 09 12:54:43 <redsh>	There's always a MAC address associated with a NIC, afaik.
Sep 09 12:54:56 <PerryHugh>	By that I meant to the other networked device
Sep 09 12:55:09 <redsh>	Others might not know about it, sure.
Sep 09 12:55:12 <PerryHugh>	as in, knowledge of the other computer's MAC address isn't available yet.
Sep 09 12:55:52 <PerryHugh>	Do I have this right now?
Sep 09 12:55:53 <redsh>	And ARP messages are for associating IP addresses with certain MAC addresses.
Sep 09 12:56:31 <redsh>	Like, if you try pinging 192.168.1.5, you ask "hey, who here is 192.168.1.5?" and add a binding if someone responds, and don't if they don't.
Sep 09 12:56:47 <PerryHugh>	Yes
Sep 09 12:57:33 <PerryHugh>	I just want to be certain I have the right order in my head for this visualization, connection, broadcast DHCP, assign IPs, ARP for MAC Addresses
Sep 09 12:58:19 <grawity>	the DHCP server usually has its own IP address assigned manually; many DHCP servers will refuse to work if the interface has no IP address
Sep 09 12:58:57 <PerryHugh>	That makes sense too, but is the order right for how computer obtain each other's MAC Addresses?
Sep 09 12:59:21 <PerryHugh>	computers*
Sep 09 12:59:29 <grawity>	I think so, yes
Sep 09 12:59:42 <djph>	PerryHugh: yes and no.
Sep 09 13:00:06 <PerryHugh>	Here we go, haha! Thank you for all the help so far btw, learning a ton.
Sep 09 13:00:12 <tds>	also keep in mind this is all ipv4-specific, it's a bit different with v6 and ndp
Sep 09 13:00:39 <PerryHugh>	Right, I haven't looked into NDP yet but am aware of it. Which aspect of the order is inaccurate?
Sep 09 13:00:46 <djph>	1. Physical Connection // 2. IP Assignment (DCHP or static) // 3. ARP
Sep 09 13:01:36 <PerryHugh>	I feel like that's the same, so you're seeing something I'm not.
Sep 09 13:01:52 <djph>	PerryHugh: you specifically called out "request DHCP"
Sep 09 13:01:56 <djph>	they don't have to
Sep 09 13:02:32 <djph>	e.g. on a network of 3 hosts, you may just statically assign an IP to each of them (thus, no DHCP at all).
Sep 09 13:02:46 <PerryHugh>	Ah, just assigning IPs by some means is more accurate than?
Sep 09 13:03:04 <PerryHugh>	That makes sense
Sep 09 13:03:10 <djph>	yeah.  You can either do it by hand ("static"), or let another computer do it for you ("Dynamic")
Sep 09 13:03:39 <PerryHugh>	Right, then that's what was meant earlier by static IP collisions being problematic, now I see.
Sep 09 13:05:33 <PerryHugh>	It all makes a ton more sense now, thank you very much djph, redsh, dminuoso, earendil, and Emperorpenguin!
Sep 09 13:11:52 <djph>	good luck PerryHugh :)
Sep 09 13:15:03 <b1rk0ff>	can I connect a IoT device I have via ethernet cable to a PC that is connected online via another ethernet cable, and then watch/sniff the IoT device network connections ?
Sep 09 13:18:28 <fructose>	b1rk0ff: I'd think so.
Sep 09 13:18:41 <b1rk0ff>	I will need the PC to assign DHCP lease and/or route the device to my DSL connection, right ?
Sep 09 13:19:41 <fructose>	b1rk0ff: That used to vary by the network card on the device in the middle, but it's possible to do such things with wireshark
Sep 09 13:20:22 <fructose>	b1rk0ff: You'll need some way to share the connection, though DHCP is just one way.
Sep 09 13:20:23 <b1rk0ff>	I want the device to be actually communicating with remote hosts
Sep 09 13:21:08 <cnf>	b1rk0ff: don't have a managed switch?
Sep 09 13:22:15 <b1rk0ff>	no, and even then how would I monitor the switch ?
Sep 09 13:22:37 <cnf>	b1rk0ff: you port mirror the switch
Sep 09 13:23:10 <b1rk0ff>	I actually tried to find a switch like that but I couldn't find one
Sep 09 13:23:15 <b1rk0ff>	I mean for buying
Sep 09 13:23:27 <b1rk0ff>	as those types of switches are things of the past, if I understand right
Sep 09 13:23:31 <cnf>	any of the TPLink smart switches?
Sep 09 13:23:47 <cnf>	thing of the past? uhm, no?
Sep 09 13:24:07 <b1rk0ff>	only a hub can show all network traffic from various devices
Sep 09 13:24:16 <mAniAk-_->	b1rk0ff: you can bridge your nic's and sniff
Sep 09 13:24:16 <cnf>	no
Sep 09 13:24:17 <grawity>	hubs are things of the past
Sep 09 13:24:27 <cnf>	b1rk0ff: you use port mirroring...
Sep 09 13:24:27 <grawity>	switches with a 'monitor' port feature, however, are very much things of today
Sep 09 13:24:35 <cnf>	yeah
Sep 09 13:24:40 <grawity>	hell the cheap 4-port TP-Link I bought last month has port mirroring
Sep 09 13:24:46 <cnf>	yep
Sep 09 13:24:56 <cnf>	all of the tplink smart switches do that, afaik
Sep 09 13:25:14 <b1rk0ff>	grawity: link/name
Sep 09 13:25:26 <grawity>	that's the same "TP-Link Unmanaged Pro" series switch that I was ranting about
Sep 09 13:25:29 <grawity>	not sure if would recommend
Sep 09 13:25:32 <grawity>	but it seems to do the job?
Sep 09 13:25:43 <cnf>	grawity: i love my TPLink switches
Sep 09 13:25:55 <grawity>	I mean, honestly, go to the manufacturer's specs page and it'll be listed as a feature
Sep 09 13:26:23 <cnf>	i got a https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/smart-switch/t1700g-28tq/ in my home lab
Sep 09 13:26:52 <grawity>	yeah I like the jetstream series stuff at work, although I'm a bit afraid of seeing the new web2.0ey firmware settings webpage they've got
Sep 09 13:27:17 <b1rk0ff>	eh, I might buy one when I'll decide to get rid of Wifi
Sep 09 13:27:44 <b1rk0ff>	cnf you have so many computers at your home ?
Sep 09 13:28:12 <cnf>	b1rk0ff: what do you mean, "so many" ?
Sep 09 13:28:45 <b1rk0ff>	I assume that if you bought that switch which has 24 ports, you might also have a lot of devices to onnect with it
Sep 09 13:29:21 <b1rk0ff>	grawity: how is that feature usually called on manufacturer's specs ?
Sep 09 13:29:25 <cnf>	a fewhttps://frank.rosquin.net/basic-homelab-setup/
Sep 09 13:29:29 <cnf>	https://frank.rosquin.net/basic-homelab-setup/
Sep 09 13:29:47 <cnf>	that doesn't list the PC's though
Sep 09 13:29:59 <grawity>	b1rk0ff: TP-Link calls it "Port mirroring" (e.g. in cnf's T1700G webpage)
Sep 09 13:30:03 <grawity>	b1rk0ff: I think that's the usual term everywhere
Sep 09 13:30:13 <linux_probe>	TP-Stink
Sep 09 13:30:22 <linux_probe>	from de bunghole
Sep 09 13:31:18 <cnf>	bs, tp link has awesome stuff
Sep 09 13:32:39 <linux_probe>	only tp-stink Ive touched was all about 1.5yrs old and failing
Sep 09 13:34:35 <cnf>	you must not touch a lot of gear
Sep 09 13:34:57 <linux_probe>	no, I just dont deal with known junk often
Sep 09 13:36:34 <cnf>	so you don't deal with anything often
Sep 09 13:36:40 <cnf>	it's all junk
Sep 09 13:36:50 <linux_probe>	well, it is all chinesium trash now, so you have a point :))
Sep 09 13:37:13 <cnf>	chinesium, american, it's all the same
Sep 09 13:37:30 <linux_probe>	because it all contains chinesium inside
Sep 09 13:37:56 <redsh>	Americium has the disadvantage of being radioactive.
Sep 09 13:37:57 <linux_probe>	unless of course you're lucky enough to get some japanesium :)
Sep 09 13:38:27 *	linux_probe points at capacitors and power supplies
Sep 09 13:38:33 <redsh>	linux_probe: Nihonium, you mean?
Sep 09 13:39:47 <b1rk0ff>	lol @ japanesium
Sep 09 13:40:01 <redsh>	That's a real element though .-.
Sep 09 13:40:13 <redsh>	(though it's called Nihonium)
Sep 09 13:40:18 <b1rk0ff>	we are all sold to China
Sep 09 13:40:20 <linux_probe>	well, in the 70's japanesium would have been a bad thing, now it;s most always a good thing
Sep 09 13:40:39 <redsh>	It has a half-life of 10 seconds :D
Sep 09 13:40:50 <cnf>	i have had japanesium fail just as bad
Sep 09 13:40:58 <linux_probe>	but alas, even they'ed pushed much of the manufacturing off to chinesium
Sep 09 13:41:02 <cnf>	fuck, use things long enough, and you see even giants fall
Sep 09 13:41:30 <cnf>	pieces of shit cisco, trashheaps juniper, damn alcatels
Sep 09 13:41:47 <linux_probe>	shitsno
Sep 09 13:42:37 <linux_probe>	they all have planned obsolescence by software anyway/support end anyway
Sep 09 13:42:55 <b1rk0ff>	I feel like shit being force-fed Chinesium.
Sep 09 13:43:05 <b1rk0ff>	Like some stupid milked cow
Sep 09 13:43:05 <linux_probe>	join the crowd
Sep 09 13:43:08 <cnf>	meanwhile, i'm very happy with my tp-link smart switches
Sep 09 13:43:16 <cnf>	and so is everyone i know that uses them
Sep 09 13:43:23 <b1rk0ff>	I will never forgive the USA for that
Sep 09 13:44:16 <linux_probe>	dont blame us, you could easily be speaking russian or german right now :0
Sep 09 13:44:28 <b1rk0ff>	you can be happy to some extant but you will always know you've been cutted in a way. It used to be where you could actually pay higher money for quality stuff.
Sep 09 13:45:08 <b1rk0ff>	Germany has top engineering
Sep 09 13:45:32 <b1rk0ff>	Russians... well, at least they are competent at some stuff.
Sep 09 13:45:57 <linux_probe>	like, drinking lots of vodka, doing krokodil?
Sep 09 13:47:11 <b1rk0ff>	I dont know... something tells me they have better quality controls than chinese
Sep 09 13:47:29 <cnf>	you can still pay more for quality stuff
Sep 09 13:47:33 <cnf>	just no one wants to
Sep 09 13:47:37 <b1rk0ff>	but ofcourse China can keep the supply as of the high rate of humans over there.
Sep 09 13:47:43 <b1rk0ff>	Russia has more land, China has more people
Sep 09 13:47:44 <linux_probe>	recent space craft repair shows how true that is :)
Sep 09 13:47:55 <b1rk0ff>	If we can get them to combine.... Russian resources and Chinese workers.
Sep 09 13:48:52 <b1rk0ff>	cnf: I'm not sure. Capitalism seems to be hung on the "maximize profits at all costs" maxim.
Sep 09 13:49:06 <b1rk0ff>	Customers are at all times low
Sep 09 13:49:14 <cnf>	b1rk0ff: you are just not willing to PAY for quality
Sep 09 13:49:15 <redsh>	Some Chinese people are migrating to the desolate wastelands of Siberia and the Russians don't really care since nobody lives there anyway.
Sep 09 13:49:24 <redsh>	Migrating? Hopping the border.
Sep 09 13:49:53 <b1rk0ff>	redsh how doyou know that?
Sep 09 13:50:07 <fructose>	cnf: There's more to it than that, not that it's an appropriate topic here.
Sep 09 13:50:08 <redsh>	That's a good question.
Sep 09 13:50:14 <b1rk0ff>	Sibera would seem like a place to go to when WW3 breask out
Sep 09 13:50:19 <b1rk0ff>	Siberia*
Sep 09 13:50:35 <b1rk0ff>	I hope by then they could host us nicely
Sep 09 13:53:30 <cnf>	fructose: there is a LOT of quality available, if you are willing to pay... but generally once people find out the price, they settle for cheap
Sep 09 14:13:14 <ivve>	is there any way to find out which ip netns i am in? example i previously started a shell.. ip netns exec xxx bash
Sep 09 14:14:18 <ivve>	there is a "ip netns identify" but can't figure out how it works?
Sep 09 14:16:35 <b1rk0ff>	cnf: how did you put your router+dsl modem under separate VLAN ?
Sep 09 14:17:07 <grawity>	your own current namespaces are shown at /proc/self/ns/net, `ip netns` bindmounts newly created namespaces at /run/netns/xxx or something like that
Sep 09 14:17:18 <grawity>	so it probably just tries to find a matching one
Sep 09 14:19:16 <ivve>	grawity: yeah i did find that one earlier, but what is that id ?
Sep 09 14:19:45 <ivve>	grawity: it doesn't correspond to name, but "net: [586040345]"
Sep 09 14:20:09 <grawity>	which one? I mentioned two
Sep 09 14:23:47 <ivve>	grawity: sorry, i will rephrase my unclear question, "ip netns exec XXX bash" and i enter a namespace, now i want to find out which namespace i entered. same output i get from ip netns ls, ie name (id: xx)
Sep 09 14:25:33 <grawity>	find the file under /run/netns that is the same file as /proc/self/ns/net
Sep 09 14:25:37 <grawity>	that's it
Sep 09 14:26:13 <ivve>	yes but then it lists _all_ the namespaces (i have a few hundred). i just want the one that i am "standing in"
Sep 09 14:26:22 <ivve>	with the shell. or while executing
Sep 09 14:26:47 <grawity>	ip netns identify $$
Sep 09 14:26:50 <ivve>	its basically like doing "ip netns exec XXX ip netns ls"
Sep 09 14:27:07 <ivve>	i tried that, output is blank?! very strange
Sep 09 14:27:27 <grawity>	it only works inside a named netns, of course
Sep 09 14:27:50 <grawity>	https://i.imgur.com/HcWFAxb.png
Sep 09 14:28:05 <grawity>	ip netns exec XXX bash -c "ip netns identify \$\$"
Sep 09 14:28:53 <ivve>	same thing happends, i wanted the output you are getting but im getting a newline only ;(
Sep 09 14:32:55 <b1rk0ff>	If I put my modem+router in bridge mode how am I supposed to connect it to another router for example?
Sep 09 14:33:37 <light>	via a network cable
Sep 09 14:33:52 <dminuoso>	I recommend wireless cables.
Sep 09 14:34:08 <b1rk0ff>	but the modem+router ethernet ports are only for clients
Sep 09 14:34:13 <dminuoso>	b1rk0ff: No they are not.
Sep 09 14:34:17 <b1rk0ff>	and then there is only rj-11
Sep 09 14:35:30 <dminuoso>	b1rk0ff: Usually the visible RJ45 connectors are attached to switch, and your router has an internal interface to that same switch.
Sep 09 14:36:00 <dminuoso>	b1rk0ff: Usual DSL modems give L2 connectivity. You can connect switches to L2 networks.
Sep 09 14:37:35 <dminuoso>	So once the modem is in bridge mode, your ethernet ports would expose that L2 connectivity in which you can run DHCP or PPPoE (depending on what your internet provider requires of you)
Sep 09 15:06:02 <mandude>	Hey dudes of the world.
Sep 09 15:06:58 <grawity>	that depends on ISP; not all of them use ethernet emulation with ADSL
Sep 09 15:07:06 <grawity>	in some countries, I've heard, it's just raw PPPoA
Sep 09 15:07:21 <dminuoso>	Heh indeed. I keep forgetting that ADSL is still a thing for some.
Sep 09 15:07:27 <grawity>	unfortunately it still is
Sep 09 15:07:39 <grawity>	fortunately, at least ours uses DHCPoE
Sep 09 15:07:40 <mandude>	So if I want to migrate vps, and I run exim4 myself, how do I make sure all the emails go along with the xfer from RS to DO
Sep 09 15:07:41 <dminuoso>	Either way, it doesn't really change what I said. :)
Sep 09 15:08:09 <dminuoso>	grawity: Honestly even PPPoE is fine.
Sep 09 15:08:20 <dminuoso>	We're still operating it, and there's certain benefits to it.
Sep 09 15:08:28 <grawity>	mandude: all existing emails or all future emails?
Sep 09 15:08:35 <hxcsp>	^
Sep 09 15:08:42 <mandude>	ah, good question sir. Both.
Sep 09 15:09:18 <mandude>	I mean the new vps is as simple as setting up exim4 there, xferring previous emails, setting up the accoounts etc. then finally pointing my mx to my new vps ip
Sep 09 15:09:28 <mandude>	I'm stuck at the xfer data part of exim4 right nwo
Sep 09 15:09:41 <mandude>	You know what I mean man, dude?
Sep 09 15:09:58 <grawity>	not really, no
Sep 09 15:10:04 <hxcsp>	what do you mean the data part?
Sep 09 15:10:23 <grawity>	exim4 does not have email storage, it gives incoming messages to procmail or whatever for final "delivery" and that's it
Sep 09 15:10:24 <mandude>	The emails. I am looking docs of exim too and trying to figure out where the emails are stored
Sep 09 15:10:30 <mandude>	ahh.
Sep 09 15:10:42 <mandude>	would that be the mta?
Sep 09 15:10:46 <mandude>	or exim4 mta?
Sep 09 15:10:49 <mandude>	I dunno this wrods
Sep 09 15:10:55 <grawity>	exim is the MTA, local stuff is handled by the MDA
Sep 09 15:10:59 <mandude>	Ah
Sep 09 15:11:02 <mandude>	mail delivery aganet
Sep 09 15:11:06 <mandude>	I got you
Sep 09 15:11:11 <grawity>	and if you have nothing, then exim itself delivers them to ~/Mail/ or /var/mail/$USER as the default
Sep 09 15:11:18 <mandude>	ahhh
Sep 09 15:11:45 <mandude>	I have setup no db, since it's only a static site server too, so exim is setup to use unix style pw files, passwd and alias files etc.
Sep 09 15:11:46 <grawity>	(I *think* it can use maildirs at ~/Mail? but generally, /var/mail/$USER is the traditional Unix email inbox)
Sep 09 15:11:55 <mandude>	So the mail would be in user's mailboxes.
Sep 09 15:12:09 <grawity>	so either way, you'd find out by looking at how you *read* this mail
Sep 09 15:12:24 <mandude>	in my case I think it's /var/mail/domainname/etc.etc.
Sep 09 15:12:28 <mandude>	I'm gonna double check
Sep 09 15:13:00 <grawity>	e.g. I use Dovecot IMAP, which is configured to store messages on Maildir backend at each system user's ~/Mail/
Sep 09 15:14:08 <mandude>	I ran it for like 5 years.
Sep 09 15:14:26 <mandude>	It was painful initially to learn for a few months and setup, and then had never any problems, other than like, spam filtering etc.
Sep 09 15:14:26 <grawity>	about time you find out where it stores things, then
Sep 09 15:14:56 <mandude>	I love exim4, though I am wondering whether I should run my own mail server anymore.
Sep 09 15:15:18 <mandude>	i did it to avoid a lot of cost. I have like 30 domains, and I need arbitrary # of email accts on each domain.
Sep 09 15:15:24 <grawity>	perhaps not after exim4 got two remotely exploitable root holes in a matter of weeks
Sep 09 15:15:27 <mandude>	Any provider charges at leat $2 per email box
Sep 09 15:15:30 <grawity>	did you upgrade
Sep 09 15:15:40 <mandude>	what kind of exploits?
Sep 09 15:15:51 <grawity>	https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/06/exim_vulnerability_patch/
Sep 09 15:16:05 <mandude>	dude.
Sep 09 15:16:05 <tairikuookami>	unless mail is something directly related to your business model, you should likely outsource that aspect.
Sep 09 15:16:09 <mandude>	You waited this long to tell me?
Sep 09 15:16:10 <grawity>	before that: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/10/security_roundup
Sep 09 15:16:18 <bezaban>	been a bad summer for exim
Sep 09 15:16:53 <tairikuookami>	use your own domain with something like https://mailbox.org/en/services#e-mail-account instead.
Sep 09 15:26:26 <banisterfiend>	hi guys, i'm curious about the relationship between TCP/UDP and ICMP
Sep 09 15:26:54 <banisterfiend>	TCP/UDP packets clearly originate from a specific process (the one opening the sockets and sending data), but can the same be said for ICMP packets? do they also originate from a 'process' ?
Sep 09 15:27:06 <banisterfiend>	or are they emitted from the networking stack itself?
Sep 09 15:27:13 <grawity>	depends on packet type
Sep 09 15:27:24 <grawity>	e.g. ICMP Echo is originated by the `ping` process
Sep 09 15:27:35 <grawity>	but ICMP error packets come from the networking stack itself
Sep 09 15:27:38 <snappy>	damnit, i was going to say no, but grawity has a clear counter example.
Sep 09 15:27:53 <grawity>	especially since many of them come from a router mid-way, which clearly doesn't have an associated process for that packet
Sep 09 15:27:57 <banisterfiend>	i ask because i have a cgroup in linux that redirects all packets from a specific process and i'm wondering if i should also expect the ICMP packets to be redirected
Sep 09 15:29:53 <banisterfiend>	grawity interesting thanks. So if an ICMP packet originates from a process, then that process must build the ICMP packet itself using raw sockets right? but any ICMP packets that result in the course of a TCP/UDP connection from that process won't appear to come from that process?
Sep 09 15:30:50 <grawity>	the former, yes
Sep 09 15:30:59 <grawity>	the latter, I'm not sure how cgroups work in that regard
Sep 09 15:31:24 <grawity>	though, what kind of ICMP packets could the network stack generate anyway?
Sep 09 15:31:41 <grawity>	feels like most of them outright cannot be associated with a process...
Sep 09 15:31:52 <snappy>	out of curiosity, how does the kernel know to send ICMP replies to the correct ping process?
Sep 09 15:32:20 <banisterfiend>	grawity well, if there's errors in the TCP connection aren't those sometimes signalled by ICMP packets? and since the TCP connection is associated with a process, mightn't the ICMP errors packets also be associated with that process?
Sep 09 15:33:23 <grawity>	snappy: I don't actually know offhand how `ping` implements it, maybe it uses raw sockets to capture all of them
Sep 09 15:33:44 <grawity>	snappy: but Echo requests/responses do have an ID that is used to associate request with response
Sep 09 15:33:47 <snappy>	ah that would actually make sense, you could just match on the ID
Sep 09 15:34:44 <detha>	the network stack will generate things like fragmentation needed, if that applies to a packet from a connection one could say the icmp packet belongs to that connection
Sep 09 15:35:08 <grawity>	but "fragmentation needed" would come from a router, not from the end host?
Sep 09 15:35:26 <grawity>	whereas if fragmentation is needed locally, you'd get that from the syscall directly?
Sep 09 15:35:51 <detha>	can come from anywhere. If I suddenly set the MTU down on my PC, with active connections, it'll do that
Sep 09 15:37:34 <snappy>	I don't think it'd come from syscall directly, once you send/write, it'll hit the ip stack which will generate the icmp message accordingly which is generated locally
Sep 09 15:37:58 <banisterfiend>	detha the thing is though, i'm tagging/marking all packtes that come from a certain PID (using cgroups) but those ICMP packets won't end up being marked right?
Sep 09 15:38:14 <banisterfiend>	since even though they arose because of the process, they're not actually coming from the process, correct?
Sep 09 15:38:33 <detha>	banisterfiend: good question. I don't know the linux network stack well enough to say Y/N
Sep 09 15:40:07 <detha>	you'd have to try, run a process as a specific user, put rules in catching 'from user and icmp' and 'from user', and force the network stack to generate something
Sep 09 15:40:17 <detha>	see which rules have counters going up
Sep 09 15:42:26 <snappy>	probably a quick way to check is have the program connect() to a inexistent port on the same or remote machine that would generate a port unreachable icmp message
Sep 09 15:43:01 <snappy>	i think if you can get that, you'll also get ongoing errors such as fragmentation needed
Sep 09 15:46:49 <snappy>	i think the answer is in the affirmative, that is the icmp will get redirected to the appropriate process; the icmp error that's received will have sufficient information for the destination process (tcp/udp port) and then get sent to the process where the socket is currently operating
Sep 09 15:47:01 <snappy>	but that's all just assumptions, anyway sleep time, good luck
Sep 09 15:50:55 <mandude>	bro diddly do dawg diggity man
Sep 09 15:50:56 <mandude>	sir.
Sep 09 15:51:04 <banisterfiend>	detha thanks :)

Sep 09 16:28:09 <Syzolin>	how to setup an irc server with ipv6 listening
Sep 09 16:38:36 <cnf>	b1rk0ff: what dsl modem?
Sep 09 17:13:38 <_BIGSHOT_>	how can i change ip route in windows to wifi ip, when lan link fails?
Sep 09 17:14:15 <_BIGSHOT_>	also, i came across speedify which does link aggregation is there anything better than speedify?
Sep 09 17:17:19 <djph>	_BIGSHOT_: it should do that automatically upon loss of your link pulse
Sep 09 17:18:12 <_BIGSHOT_>	djph, no i have to pull lan wire out... on then it happens, otherwise windows gets confused
Sep 09 17:18:19 <_BIGSHOT_>	only then**
Sep 09 17:21:12 <_BIGSHOT_>	djph, ????
Sep 09 17:21:49 <grawity>	then maybe it's not the LAN link which fails
Sep 09 17:22:13 <detha>	That sounds 'As Designed'. If there is an ethernet link, it won't drop the route through that.
Sep 09 17:22:36 <_BIGSHOT_>	grawity, bud you got any solution for this?
Sep 09 17:29:53 <mgolisch>	yeah fix your lan
Sep 09 17:30:02 <mgolisch>	we told you like the past 2 weeks or so
Sep 09 17:31:58 <djph>	_BIGSHOT_: then you're not losing "LAN Link", and therefore Windows is behaving correctly
Sep 09 17:32:34 <_BIGSHOT_>	djph, windows only sees the lights blinking not the ICMP echo packets
Sep 09 17:34:27 <djph>	long as the lights are blinken' it's got a link pulse
Sep 09 17:34:32 <djph>	and that's all Windows cares about
Sep 09 17:35:02 <_BIGSHOT_>	bud it is 2020 now, OSes have to be more *advanced*
Sep 09 17:35:21 <mgolisch>	you network just needs to be less shitty..
Sep 09 17:35:27 <mgolisch>	+r
Sep 09 17:35:50 <_BIGSHOT_>	black outs
Sep 09 17:37:22 <djph>	"advanced"?  The auto-switch is based around "link or no", that's it.
Sep 09 17:38:02 <_BIGSHOT_>	advanced meaning taking care of all the if-elses
Sep 09 17:38:15 <_BIGSHOT_>	not just link up or down
Sep 09 17:38:31 <djph>	ah
Sep 09 17:38:46 <djph>	so you want it swapping back and forth every 42 seconds because reasons
Sep 09 17:39:16 <c|oneman>	can you just assign a higher metric to WLAN?
Sep 09 17:39:17 <_BIGSHOT_>	don't argue bud, just get the point and move on
Sep 09 17:39:44 <_BIGSHOT_>	c|oneman, i tried that but still i need to pull out cable
Sep 09 17:40:16 <_BIGSHOT_>	c|oneman, giving higher metric to WLAN is not what i want
Sep 09 17:40:22 <_BIGSHOT_>	WLAN is only a backup
Sep 09 17:41:20 <c|oneman>	https://www.accessagility.com/bridgechecker
Sep 09 17:41:38 <c|oneman>	this seems to be a potential solution, the question is weather a custom detection rule (e.g. ping) can be used
Sep 09 17:43:55 <_BIGSHOT_>	c|oneman, looks nice but is the app safe?
Sep 09 17:44:37 <c|oneman>	run it through virustotal
Sep 09 17:45:12 <c|oneman>	in any case, if it doesn't do what you want you should contact them to impliment a ping checker like failover firewalls do
Sep 09 17:45:22 <c|oneman>	that would be an important feature in my opinion
Sep 09 17:45:36 <c|oneman>	if someone is going to bother with a 3rd party app it should have that option
Sep 09 18:20:55 <doxxy>	lots of amatuers working on the infrastructure these days

Sep 09 19:11:06 <zenix_2k2>	question, i was trying to build a SSL wrapper but i accidentally used an anonymous cipher but since it's vuln to MITM, what cipher should i use ?
Sep 09 19:11:50 <zenix_2k2>	ciphers="ADH-AES256-SHA" as i used
Sep 09 19:13:33 <t0x0sh>	zenix_2k2: which version of TLS are you using ?
Sep 09 19:14:29 <zenix_2k2>	OpenSSL 1.1.0k
Sep 09 19:15:18 <t0x0sh>	Ok, so probably TLS 1.2
Sep 09 19:15:52 <zenix_2k2>	but since i could change the version to whatever i want, so what should i go for
Sep 09 19:16:28 <zenix_2k2>	most of people on stackoverflow suggested me ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1
Sep 09 19:16:31 <zenix_2k2>	..tho
Sep 09 19:17:32 <t0x0sh>	The latest version (TLS 1.3) is probably the best, but is not currently well deployed.
Sep 09 19:18:04 <t0x0sh>	Read this: https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices
Sep 09 19:19:10 <ZedHeadTed|>	zenix_2k2: There's an ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2
Sep 09 19:19:21 <ZedHeadTed|>	What version of Python are you using?
Sep 09 19:19:24 <zenix_2k2>	yea but i am wondering what to put into ciphers=<>
Sep 09 19:19:32 <zenix_2k2>	3.5.5
Sep 09 19:19:35 <zenix_2k2>	3.5.3*
Sep 09 19:20:15 <t0x0sh>	If you want to choose one ciphersuite (it is not really recommended), the TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 is secure for example.
Sep 09 19:21:01 <zenix_2k2>	Hm, but if i go for anonymous cipher, is it still encrypted when being sent ?
Sep 09 19:21:07 <zenix_2k2>	even tho they don't exchange certificates
Sep 09 19:21:59 <t0x0sh>	Never use anonymous ciphers, they are broken.
Sep 09 19:22:18 <zenix_2k2>	well, idk, were they invented for a reason ?
Sep 09 19:23:20 <detha>	so was telnet access
Sep 09 19:23:43 <t0x0sh>	There are full of mistakes in the history of SSL/TLS...
Sep 09 19:24:04 <zenix_2k2>	well ok so no anonymous cip
Sep 09 19:26:47 <t0x0sh>	Here is a good explaination of anonymous ciphersuites: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8413093/in-which-cases-can-an-ssl-server-omit-sending-the-certificate
Sep 09 19:38:06 <Aleksandar86>	Hello. I want to create script which can access to switch via telnet and dump ARP cashe. Does somebody have some example (Powershell, batch, bash...etc)?
Sep 09 19:40:37 <Aeso>	Aleksandar86, napalm and textfsm makes that pretty easy.
Sep 09 19:41:02 <Aleksandar86>	I have 15 smart switches in network and sometimes I dont know in which port is connected some device. With this script I will dump all arp and search mac address of device.
Sep 09 19:41:49 <Aleksandar86>	*on which
Sep 09 19:44:20 <zenix_2k2>	t0x0sh: also i am not so sure what is different from a private key and a certificate, your link doesn't explain much
Sep 09 19:47:25 <t0x0sh>	zenix_2k2: a certificate contains a public key, a signature (from a CA), and other informations (serials, the common name, expirations dates, etc).
Sep 09 19:49:11 <t0x0sh>	zenix_2k2: and you have a private key associated to the public key of the certificate. You use it when you need to "prove" you own the certificate.
Sep 09 19:50:59 <t0x0sh>	the certificate could be public...The private key must not.
Sep 09 19:51:25 <zenix_2k2>	huh, don't they just use the public key to encrypt the data then send it away and whoever holds the private key can decrypt it ?
Sep 09 19:51:41 <zenix_2k2>	like how asymmetric works
Sep 09 19:53:17 <t0x0sh>	It's not how it works actually in TLS. (except for RSA_* ciphersuites, which are not recommanded anymore)
Sep 09 19:54:21 <t0x0sh>	Certificates and RSA are only used for authentication (with signatures).
Sep 09 19:54:41 <mawk>	or for communicating with dissidents
Sep 09 20:01:30 <zenix_2k2>	t0x0sh: so a certificate is just like a public key, except it contains more information ?
Sep 09 20:02:23 <shibboleth>	it's a public key signed by the ca
Sep 09 20:08:08 <zenix_2k2>	ca ? like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA_Technologies ?
Sep 09 20:08:10 <redsh>	They may contain lots of other info as well. x509 certainly has an abundance of info...
Sep 09 20:08:16 <redsh>	zenix_2k2: Certificate authority.
Sep 09 20:10:48 <zenix_2k2>	also what did they use to sign, the entire content of the certificate ?
Sep 09 20:10:59 <zenix_2k2>	which i mean grabbing all information then hash them
Sep 09 20:12:02 <redsh>	Dunno. But the holder of the keypair (with x509, at least) has to create a certificate signature request (CSR), then submit that to the CA.
Sep 09 20:12:32 <redsh>	You can't really sign the certificate itself since that contains the signature. Chicken and egg issue.
Sep 09 20:21:20 <_BIGSHOT_>	so what's the best way to "override" pulling cable out of LAN? will diverting route && metric in route print do the trick in windows 10?

Sep 09 20:23:33 <tatertots>	override
Sep 09 20:24:24 <tatertots>	plug it back in
Sep 09 20:26:43 <zenix_2k2>	redsh: ok... and i assume all info inside a cert is blank text
Sep 09 20:27:55 <redsh>	zenix_2k2: Open up any random HTTPS website in Firefox, right-click, "view page info", "security", "view certificate"
Sep 09 20:28:12 <redsh>	Go to "details" and browse to your heart's content.

Sep 09 21:38:50 <mguy>	It's just an old crusty unix box. companies are moving off of them if they didn't already
Sep 09 21:39:21 <DoYouKnow>	but by the time optical computers are out, do you think they'll start to redo instruction sets?
Sep 09 21:39:36 <DoYouKnow>	in an easily workable manner?
Sep 09 21:40:17 <DoYouKnow>	or some kind of analog computer
Sep 09 21:40:44 <DoYouKnow>	I mean, a lot of the new instructions are crypto related and related to EFI
Sep 09 21:40:49 <DoYouKnow>	'new instructions'
Sep 09 21:40:56 <DoYouKnow>	mostly for pipelining right?
Sep 09 21:41:21 <DoYouKnow>	EFI/UEFI
Sep 09 21:43:30 <DoYouKnow>	like AES-NI
Sep 09 21:50:57 <DoYouKnow>	mguy, I'm reading business at the speed of thought now
Sep 09 21:51:04 <amrx>	https://admin.google.com/u/1/AdminHome?hl=en&fral=1#Reports:subtab=ldap-audit
Sep 09 21:51:07 <amrx>	ops
Sep 09 21:51:07 <DoYouKnow>	I think I was too young for it last time I tried to read it
Sep 09 21:51:39 <mguy>	I think I read that
Sep 09 21:56:23 <lntl>	I have two networks at home: a wired and a wireless network each serving their own dhcp. The wireless network occupies a dhcp lease on the wired network. Both networks have a few machines on them. Suppose I want to SSH from a machine on the wired network, into a machine on the wireless network. Outside of port forwarding, how can this be accomplished? There are multiple machines on the wireless network and reconfiguring the forwardi
Sep 09 21:57:47 <mguy>	Can you route between them? Why not just combine the networks
Sep 09 21:58:20 <Thuryn>	just route between them
Sep 09 21:58:25 <Thuryn>	i do this at home.  works fine,
Sep 09 21:58:44 <Thuryn>	i don't bother NAT-ing between the wireless and wired networks
Sep 09 22:00:27 <lntl>	How does routing between them work? Would you point me towards literature?
Sep 09 22:00:30 <mrbell1984>	It’s a home network, why split it up?
Sep 09 22:00:48 <snappy>	lntl: how are the wired and wireless network connected?
Sep 09 22:01:12 <mrbell1984>	I think this is a homework question amarite?
Sep 09 22:02:02 <lntl>	The wireless network is connected to a port on the wired network's router
Sep 09 22:02:36 <Thuryn>	put the wireless access point in bridge mode and be done.
Sep 09 22:02:37 <lntl>	homework as in this is my network at home that I am working on
Sep 09 22:04:00 <lntl>	lol, my description does read like a homework question
Sep 09 22:04:08 <mrbell1984>	Yep if the wireless device supports bridge mode stick it in that mode.  Also you probably only want 1 network not multiple.  Especially if it’s a home network.
Sep 09 22:07:18 <lntl>	ok, i will check into support for bridge mode
Sep 09 22:07:44 <lntl>	thanks my fellow nerds
Sep 09 22:07:50 <mrbell1984>	What model is the device
Sep 09 22:08:20 <lntl>	atheros ar9223 I THINK
Sep 09 22:08:49 <lntl>	It probably does
Sep 09 22:19:16 <Atlenohen>	Just put it in the cable!!!! https://the5gsummit.com/
Sep 09 22:26:14 <mrbell1984>	So is 5G unsafe, is 4G unsafe? Is 3G unsafe?
Sep 09 22:26:44 <TJ->	I've a weird issue on an embedded Linux IAD gateway/router. there's a device with a static IP (10.254.0.3/24) in a non-default sub-net connected to eth4 set to 10.254.0.254/24. Running tcpdump shows ARP replies when running "ping 10.254.0.3" but "ip neigh" shows it as "FAILED" and ping returns "Request timed out". It has "iptables -I INPUT 1 -i eth4 -j ACCEPT". Trying to figure out why the ping is
Sep 09 22:26:46 <TJ->	failing
Sep 09 22:27:49 <S_SubZero>	The only safe G is a straight up OG
Sep 09 22:28:02 <linux_probe>	mmmm... https://www.zdnet.com/article/newly-discovered-cyber-espionage-malware-abuses-windows-bits-service/
Sep 09 22:33:04 <linux_probe>	wrong gateway @ TJ- ?
Sep 09 22:33:39 <TJ->	linux_probe: no gateway involved
Sep 09 22:33:43 <linux_probe>	try flopping the .254 to .1...
Sep 09 22:33:52 <linux_probe>	yeah, there shouldn;t bem but you know how that goes
Sep 09 22:34:10 <snappy>	mrbell1984: i'm guessing probably; but i think each device has a unique keypair to the carrier and at least with 4g and beyond the encryption algorithms haven't been broken ... yet.
Sep 09 22:34:11 <TJ->	these are directly connected to each other
Sep 09 22:34:25 <linux_probe>	yeahm but there's a gateway setting in the other device I'd bet
Sep 09 22:34:41 <TJ->	linux_probe: no, there is not
Sep 09 22:34:43 <linux_probe>	possible static caches and more
Sep 09 22:35:38 <linux_probe>	so, you have root access on the other device
Sep 09 22:37:38 <TJ->	connecting the device to another PC setting the same local IP address it works. There's something on the gateway device interferring. I'm thinking it might be something to do with offloading
Sep 09 22:37:52 <TJ->	the device is a CDU which is configured statically and is usually on an isolated subnet (10.254.0.0/24) - got it connected to the gateway/router/switch and it hits this issue. Something to do with the config but not been able to figure out what
Sep 09 22:42:05 <sourcream>	Can DDoS attacks cause "network unreachable" error when the attacked machine tries to connect somewhere?
Sep 09 22:42:13 <sourcream>	what causes network unreachable
Sep 09 22:44:51 <TJ->	sourcream: generally, no route exists
Sep 09 22:46:13 <sourcream>	TJ-, I suspected DDoS attack first since websocket servers started lagging and ping increased but is that error related to it or is it more likely some other network problem?
Sep 09 22:47:23 <TJ->	sourcream: I'd expect a time out if it was a DDoS
Sep 09 22:47:36 <sourcream>	Yeah exactly thats what I thought as well
Sep 09 22:48:08 <sourcream>	I am using OVH, I didnt get any ddos attack notification email either
Sep 09 22:55:11 <banisterfiend>	does anyone know how to use the `route change` command in macos? i need to change a route to be a scoped route
Sep 09 23:02:33 <pppingme>	banisterfiend what do you mean "scoped route"?
Sep 09 23:02:46 <pppingme>	the normal means to "change" a route is to delete the old one, and add a new one
Sep 09 23:05:24 <banisterfiend>	pppingme a scoped route appears to be one where you specify the `-ifscope` flag
Sep 09 23:05:30 <banisterfiend>	e.g: route add default 192.168.1.1 -ifscope en0
Sep 09 23:05:32 <banisterfiend>	binds the route to the en0 interface
Sep 09 23:05:55 <banisterfiend>	there is a 'route change' option, and i wnat to use it to just append an `-ifscope` to an existing route, but i can't figure out the syntax
Sep 10 00:23:59 <praxis>	is there a way to discover the publish/release date of a particular URL?
Sep 10 00:25:09 <draganivanovic>	Probably no
Sep 10 00:25:42 <elf>	the html content? metadata headers may have some info
Sep 10 00:25:56 <elf>	wayback machine for some historical info
Sep 10 00:26:04 <draganivanovic>	Maybe if you have acess to the server and see creation date of files
Sep 10 00:26:05 <elf>	and search engine index times
Sep 10 00:26:41 <praxis>	I can see a modified date in the page source, but it doesn't really reflect the date the information became available, i guess some minor or aesthetic modification was made since the original date
Sep 10 00:26:48 <praxis>	yeah i'll check archive.org
Sep 10 00:27:22 <praxis>	it's not my site, i'm just referencing a release date for an os
Sep 10 00:27:42 <draganivanovic>	good luck I guess
Sep 10 00:27:48 <praxis>	and it might look weird if i use some date that doesn't reflect the info
Sep 10 00:28:23 <djph>	re-verify with a third party
Sep 10 00:28:47 <elf>	release date of an OS? mailing lists
Sep 10 00:28:58 <elf>	or wikipedia
Sep 10 00:29:01 <djph>	^ those too.
Sep 10 00:30:05 <elf>	or - and this is shocking, i know - tell some IRCers what OS release date you're looking for and they might be able to help find it
Sep 10 00:30:28 *	elf increases his caffeine intake
Sep 10 00:30:30 <praxis>	it's no biggy, it would just be nice, you know if i could
Sep 10 00:30:30 <praxis>	yeah, i know when it was released, it's just a formality. i mean, you and i know the wikipedia article is probably spot on, but it isn't really considered a credible source
Sep 10 00:30:49 <elf>	use the citation
Sep 10 00:31:51 <praxis>	THE citation? that's what i'm writing. the citation
Sep 10 00:32:26 <elf>	ah
Sep 10 00:32:28 <djph>	0he meant wikipedia's citation of the date
Sep 10 00:32:37 <djph>	... or not
Sep 10 00:32:57 <panda81>	For a peer to peer application, does the server it connects to differ from non-p2p?
Sep 10 00:33:16 <djph>	although, i seem to revall website citations are "x.domain.tld; accessed on $date"
Sep 10 00:33:47 <djph>	yeah, peer-2-peer "servers" are other clients
Sep 10 00:34:35 <praxis>	ah yeah, i get ya.  there actually isn't one. that was my first thought too
Sep 10 00:35:44 <praxis>	djph: nah, i think you were right
Sep 10 00:38:26 <praxis>	i mean, there was a press release written on the day of (i assume). wayback machine archived it a week and a half later https://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110205a
Sep 10 00:44:57 <praxis>	oh wait, i was wrong. it was published in advance.. two years prior. in anticipation of the release i guess
Sep 10 00:45:03 <praxis>	oh well doesn't matter
Sep 10 01:21:02 <banisterfiend>	does anyone know what determines the order of output from `netstat -nr` i.e when displaying the routing table?
Sep 10 01:21:20 <banisterfiend>	even if i add a new route, it doesn't appear first in the list
Sep 10 02:17:12 <jonathana>	I have this strange issue with my ethernet port where it will attempt to connect but dhcp fails. The responses are almost all 0's. It's incredibly strange. Could anybody take a look at my pcap file and lend some knowledge?
Sep 10 02:19:03 <jonathana>	It's only 20 packets my friends
Sep 10 02:22:37 <elf>	pastebin it
Sep 10 02:25:28 <jonathana>	somehow I feel like sending it as plain text will lose data but I'll give it a shot haha

Sep 10 02:26:57 <doxxy>	amatuers
Sep 10 02:27:16 <jonathana>	does it re-encode just fine?
Sep 10 02:27:37 <jonathana>	cat does what cat does I guess
Sep 10 02:30:47 <tatertots>	jonathana: do you have connectivity if you assign a static ip ?
Sep 10 02:31:35 <tatertots>	jonathana: meaning like a static ip from the same LAN, ip,netmask,gateway and dns if applicable
Sep 10 02:32:19 <nojeffrey>	With a Fortigate(5.6.11) on the CLI, is "configure system link-monitor" the same as the GUI SD-WAN Status Check?
Sep 10 02:32:48 <tatertots>	jonathana: is this just a laptop/desktop nic you're talking about? if so what operating system is being used?
Sep 10 02:37:15 <jonathana>	tatertots: using manjaro and it's ethernet. Could possibly assign a static IP on the router end
Sep 10 02:38:43 *	jonathana changing nick
Sep 10 02:41:36 <tatertots>	rendysurvage: do you have access to another pc close by?...
Sep 10 02:41:57 <tatertots>	take the same wire ....stick it into a known good pc
Sep 10 02:42:01 <rendysurvage>	I have internet access through wifi.
Sep 10 02:42:13 <rendysurvage>	It's known not to work in multiple devices
Sep 10 02:42:16 <rendysurvage>	but it works sometimes
Sep 10 02:42:19 <tatertots>	stick your wire into something else
Sep 10 02:42:37 <rendysurvage>	It drops out on any device I plug it into
Sep 10 02:42:38 <tatertots>	does something "else" connect
Sep 10 02:42:43 <rendysurvage>	no
Sep 10 02:43:16 <tatertots>	what device is at the other end of the cable?
Sep 10 02:43:24 <tatertots>	include model make etc

Sep 10 02:45:37 <rendysurvage>	hardware is
Sep 10 02:45:55 <tatertots>	if the other end of the ethernet cable was in your cats paw or on the floor...you can expect to not have connectivity lol
Sep 10 02:46:52 <tatertots>	ah okay..a router
Sep 10 02:47:24 <tatertots>	try another "interface"
Sep 10 02:47:55 <rendysurvage>	linksys ea6350 on the other end of the cable. I've cable tested it and I'm getting signal through the cat5
Sep 10 02:48:30 <tatertots>	how many LAN ports does ea6350 have?
Sep 10 02:48:46 <rendysurvage>	4 lan and 1 wan

Sep 10 02:49:06 <tatertots>	coughs...interface
Sep 10 02:49:27 <tatertots>	try all four 4x ports
Sep 10 02:49:39 <tatertots>	same results on all 4x? yes/no?
Sep 10 02:51:56 <rendysurvage>	same
Sep 10 02:52:08 <rendysurvage>	power led on the port keeps dropping out
Sep 10 02:52:16 <rendysurvage>	I'm thinking that cable is too long
Sep 10 02:52:36 <rendysurvage>	poor insulation maybe
Sep 10 02:52:43 <sinshiva>	what linkrate does the device get?
Sep 10 02:52:44 <tatertots>	well we know what it is NOT lol
Sep 10 02:52:58 <tatertots>	try another cable
Sep 10 02:53:04 <rendysurvage>	I have tried a few cables
Sep 10 02:53:15 <rendysurvage>	on the port wired into the wall
Sep 10 02:53:32 <rendysurvage>	so it could be the ones wired into the house. I did not install these.
Sep 10 02:53:33 <tatertots>	ae6350 does it have a console port?
Sep 10 02:53:44 <rendysurvage>	I'm ssh'd into it
Sep 10 02:53:48 <rendysurvage>	via wifi
Sep 10 02:53:57 <tatertots>	i don't own one personally ...and i'm not even gonna google it for you....because i'm chillin
Sep 10 02:54:51 <sinshiva>	it sounds more like cpu switchport is being bumped off the bridge
Sep 10 02:54:56 <rendysurvage>	Whoa dude. I merely asked for someone to look into my pcap file. Maybe it isn't that simple but I don't want to inconvenience anybody too much
Sep 10 02:55:07 <tatertots>	you should examine your network configuration, your expectations would be not realistic
Sep 10 02:55:11 <sinshiva>	after you flashed openwrt, did you factory reset firmware defaults?
Sep 10 02:55:17 <rendysurvage>	I did
Sep 10 02:55:29 <rendysurvage>	All the other ports in the house work just fine
Sep 10 02:55:34 <tatertots>	could
Sep 10 02:56:01 <rendysurvage>	It's just the one that's furthest away from the router that doesn't work. I also have a supplimental dumb switch for the other ports.
Sep 10 02:56:02 <vidy>	if you put a different device on the ends does the cable work fine?
Sep 10 02:56:07 <tatertots>	no worries ..i was just helping you trouble shoot
Sep 10 02:57:13 <rendysurvage>	I do get a connection with a newer device. My Sager work laptop running 10. It's the only one that works consistantly.
Sep 10 02:57:29 <rendysurvage>	"constistantly"
Sep 10 02:57:37 <rendysurvage>	= most of the time
Sep 10 02:58:15 <vidy>	well that's one side - but have you tried like two laptops only on the link?
Sep 10 03:00:38 <tatertots>	do you get a connection with ANY "other" device.....
Sep 10 03:00:52 <rendysurvage>	vidy: I haven't. I'll have to do that.
Sep 10 03:02:13 <vidy>	idk how big your house is or where that wire runs, or what grade cable it is, but maybe also try forcing it to 100/full instead of gigabit
Sep 10 03:02:22 <tatertots>	you only have that one single windows 10 laptop to test with? it Windows 10 works on all 4x ports, but manjaro works on NONE ...you need to see what you got going on there
Sep 10 03:02:26 <rendysurvage>	tatertots: yes. I used to get a constant connection but it drops out for a long time
Sep 10 03:02:55 <tatertots>	^ if windows 10
Sep 10 03:03:32 <rendysurvage>	alright. tatertots, your assumption that I'm some form of stupid is insulting and misplaced.
Sep 10 03:03:47 <tatertots>	if that's true i suspect you tried to do some manual networking in manjaro
Sep 10 03:05:37 <rendysurvage>	yup
Sep 10 03:05:47 <tatertots>	as Windows 10 is happily connected on all 4x ports of ea6350 (receiving a dhcp assigned addy)
Sep 10 03:05:56 <rendysurvage>	That's an assumption
Sep 10 03:05:59 <tatertots>	but your little manjaro experiment....FAIL

Sep 10 03:29:39 <jennie>	hello, if I plug this internet fiber modem internet ethernet wire into my computer ethernet port then it gives 169.xx IP and shows *unidentified network* but when I put fiber modem internet ethernet wire into cisco firewall then it works fine, can you tell me what is needed to make internet work in computer?
Sep 10 03:29:50 <jennie>	from fiber modem wire -> to computer
Sep 10 03:31:28 <snappy>	jennie: so 169.x.x.x address is assigned to your computer when no dhcp server can be found, so it falls back to 169
Sep 10 03:31:51 <snappy>	it's called an 'automatic private ip address'
Sep 10 03:32:30 <Mead>	APIPA!!!
Sep 10 03:32:55 <snappy>	anyway i can't really make heads or tails of what you're connecting where
Sep 10 03:33:29 <light>	she jammed the internet wire into the computer hole and it don't internet, but if you slide the wire into the cisco it do
Sep 10 03:33:52 <light>	maybe you have vdsl
Sep 10 03:33:53 <jennie>	snappy, Device1 is fiber modem from ISP, Device2 is cisco firewall, Device3 is my computer,  Device1 is connected directly into device2, i want to connect device1 into device3 and make it work
Sep 10 03:34:25 <jennie>	i am trying to understand, whats stopping computer from getting internet directly from ISP modem to my computer
Sep 10 03:34:36 <snappy>	call isp!
Sep 10 03:34:39 <jennie>	and why its giving hardware ip if I plug it into my computer
Sep 10 03:35:08 <jennie>	https://dasanzhone.com/product/znid-gpon-2400a-series/ is this the ISP modem
Sep 10 03:35:15 <jennie>	this is the isp modem*
Sep 10 03:35:48 <jennie>	Without calling ISP can you tell me what type of configuration has been done on ISP modem? if you know a little bit about it
Sep 10 03:37:06 <tsujp>	It seems my IPv6 connectivity isn't working

Sep 10 03:37:57 <tsujp>	How might I fix that?
Sep 10 03:37:59 <snappy>	(or one of your intermediate hops doesn't have a route)
Sep 10 03:38:19 <snappy>	add routes
Sep 10 03:41:54 <tsujp>	Would this have something to do with how I am defining my interface?
Sep 10 03:42:07 <tsujp>	ip route get is giving: unreachable 2a02:c207:2022:709:112::41 dev lo proto kernel src 2a01:4f8:172:2c01::1100 metric 4294967295 error -101 pref medium

Sep 10 04:07:11 <Ruzzy>	which is wrong, because there's only 24 sockets on the patch panel
Sep 10 04:08:07 <Ruzzy>	so I hook something up to the first socket and my switch, then I go up to the MDF and plug a laptop in to 201 on the MDF patch panel
Sep 10 04:08:19 <Ruzzy>	Nothing happens.
Sep 10 04:08:25 <Ruzzy>	does VERT mean something?
Sep 10 04:11:01 <tatertots>	Ruzzy: use  your fluke
Sep 10 04:11:08 <Ruzzy>	my wha?
Sep 10 04:11:09 <tatertots>	why don't you have a fluke
Sep 10 04:11:23 <tatertots>	tone generator
Sep 10 04:11:35 <tatertots>	something of that sort
Sep 10 04:11:45 <Ruzzy>	My main reason is I have no idea what you're talking about
Sep 10 04:11:55 <Ruzzy>	What is this sorcery
Sep 10 04:11:56 <tatertots>	that's acceptable
Sep 10 04:12:20 <tatertots>	a tone generator isn't really what i would call sorcery
Sep 10 04:12:38 <tatertots>	but i keeps one in my bag
Sep 10 04:12:55 <tatertots>	you should keep a tone generator on you also
Sep 10 04:13:41 <tatertots>	i'm just some loser that carries a tone generator around in a bag...don't listen to me
Sep 10 04:13:50 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, what does this tool do for me
Sep 10 04:14:46 <tatertots>	well it sounds like you're trying to figure out what's going where and why
Sep 10 04:14:59 <tatertots>	a fluke comes in handy in situations like that
Sep 10 04:15:28 <tatertots>	buy yourself one
Sep 10 04:15:35 <tatertots>	they aren't terribly expensive
Sep 10 04:16:33 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, https://www.jaycar.com.au/network-cable-tracer/p/XC5083
Sep 10 04:16:39 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, is this the right thing?
Sep 10 04:17:07 <tatertots>	yes
Sep 10 04:17:19 <tatertots>	you should own one
Sep 10 04:17:21 <tatertots>	i do
Sep 10 04:17:42 <tatertots>	i feel rather silly admitting it ...but i do
Sep 10 04:18:33 <tatertots>	I do believe it would make things easier for you if you owned one
Sep 10 04:19:12 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, I'll get one
Sep 10 04:19:45 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, if I have a cable tracer then is it beneficial to have a network cable tester?
Sep 10 04:20:04 <Ruzzy>	I never terminate cables myself
Sep 10 04:20:20 <tatertots>	well if you get a fancy one..you get both in one unit ...a tracer AND tester
Sep 10 04:20:51 <tatertots>	if you order one of the really fancy ones made by "fluke networks" you can get LCD display, some are even touch screen
Sep 10 04:21:26 <tatertots>	if you're rich go for the "fluke networks" brand...you won't regret it
Sep 10 04:23:51 <tatertots>	might as well splurge and get the fluke brand..treat yourself
Sep 10 04:30:44 <doxxy>	whatever
Sep 10 04:30:54 <azonenberg>	Does anybody know if it's possible to make BIND return NXDOMAIN for a particular domain?
Sep 10 04:31:09 <azonenberg>	Specifically NXDOMAIN, SERVFAIL/refused/no response are not acceptable
Sep 10 04:31:42 <azonenberg>	the domain actually exists but i need clients to think it doesn't
Sep 10 04:37:00 <Ruzzy>	This cable tracer is marketed as a "network cable tracer" but it has an RJ11 plug
Sep 10 04:37:11 <Ruzzy>	Will that RJ11 plug test RJ45 connections fine?
Sep 10 04:37:45 <tatertots>	mine has both RJ45 AND RJ11
Sep 10 04:37:56 <tatertots>	you should shop around a bit
Sep 10 04:38:04 <tatertots>	look at different brands
Sep 10 04:38:11 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, I'm in Australia and our range is trash
Sep 10 04:39:00 <tatertots>	I understand
Sep 10 04:39:35 <Ruzzy>	tatertots, luck may be on my side
Sep 10 04:39:37 <Ruzzy>	https://www.altronics.com.au/p/q1341-professional-cable-tracer-and-network-cable-tester/
Sep 10 04:39:52 <Ruzzy>	It's in stock in my nearest outlet too
Sep 10 04:40:03 <tatertots>	I like that one
Sep 10 04:40:21 <tatertots>	kinda looks like my fluke networks one i have at work
Sep 10 04:40:49 <tatertots>	that's a nice one with display
Sep 10 04:42:59 <tatertots>	once you have that you'll have both floors figured out in no time
Sep 10 04:58:13 <bruxc>	2u patch panel , 1u switch - what's the standard length of an ethernet cable, 1ft or 6in?
Sep 10 04:58:42 <azonenberg>	I usually use 1ft patch cables to avoid putting too much bend on them
Sep 10 04:58:55 <azonenberg>	a 6-inch is really tight especially if your patch ports and switch aren't exactly lined up
Sep 10 04:59:05 <azonenberg>	patch panels are evenly spaced, most switches have ports in groups
Sep 10 04:59:25 <azonenberg>	you might get away with 6's for ports right on top, but not for the rest
Sep 10 05:54:19 <mandude>	Hello
Sep 10 05:56:12 <mandude>	I am sharing internet from macbook to desktop. macbook is 192.168.0.x and desktop is 192.168.2.x. From 192,168.2.x (macbook's internal network for sharing) I cannot ping 192.168.0.x (wifi lan). From wifi lan machiens on 192.168.0.x  I can successfully ping 192.168.2.x
Sep 10 05:56:20 <mandude>	Any advice on what I have to do to make it work both ways
Sep 10 05:58:26 <mandude>	How come I can talk to outside network, but outside network can't talk to machines in the  macbook network?
Sep 10 05:58:32 <rewt>	set up a route to 192.168.0.x via macbook from desktop
Sep 10 05:58:41 <mandude>	I don't understand that means
Sep 10 05:58:43 <mandude>	sorry
Sep 10 05:58:52 <mandude>	i need to add a route using ip?
Sep 10 05:58:57 <mandude>	ip route add something?
Sep 10 05:58:59 <rewt>	on the desktop, add a route to tell it that it can reach 192.168.0.x via macbook
Sep 10 05:59:05 <mandude>	Ahh
Sep 10 05:59:07 <mandude>	I see.
Sep 10 05:59:37 <mandude>	so
Sep 10 05:59:44 <rewt>	ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.2.macbook
Sep 10 06:00:14 <mandude>	ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.2.x
Sep 10 06:00:15 <mandude>	ahh
Sep 10 06:00:22 <mandude>	what about the device name?
Sep 10 06:00:33 <rewt>	what about it?
Sep 10 06:00:37 <mandude>	do I eed it?
Sep 10 06:00:46 <mandude>	which nic
Sep 10 06:00:46 <rewt>	no
Sep 10 06:00:48 <mandude>	ok
Sep 10 06:03:06 <mandude>	thank you my friend
Sep 10 06:03:11 <mandude>	very helpful you are
Sep 10 06:04:42 <rewt>	np
Sep 10 06:11:23 <Janusss>	Does anyone know where I can force windows' firewall into public profile?
Sep 10 06:12:46 <rewt>	set your current network connection to a public network
Sep 10 06:13:43 <rewt>	right click on network icon by the clock / open network & internet settings / change connection properties / public
Sep 10 06:14:06 <Janusss>	Yep, but where is the group policy?
Sep 10 06:14:07 <Janusss>	I remember there is a group policy to set this
Sep 10 06:14:11 <Janusss>	But I forgot where it is
Sep 10 06:15:03 <rewt>	it's based on the network connection
Sep 10 06:15:25 <rewt>	for each new network connection it asks you if it's public or private the first time you connect to it
Sep 10 06:16:55 <Janusss>	No way I can force it into public location?
Sep 10 06:17:23 <rewt>	there might be a netsh command for it
Sep 10 06:18:20 <Janusss>	Thanks bro

Sep 10 07:33:12 <earendil>	lol no
Sep 10 07:33:18 <earendil>	powershell makes me want to hork
Sep 10 07:33:21 <_BIGSHOT_>	okay.
Sep 10 07:33:41 <earendil>	i get that its powerful and useful, but my god, the fucking variable naming conventions make me want to commit suicide lol
Sep 10 07:34:13 <_BIGSHOT_>	okay

Sep 10 08:32:58 <earendil>	sorry did i forget the /sarc
Sep 10 09:55:01 <kristhian>	hi guys, i wanted to ask if what's the possible solution when you can't open firewall using ufw, i tried opening the port using iptables as well but still the port wont open
Sep 10 09:55:36 <dminuoso>	kristhian: What do you mean by "open port"
Sep 10 09:56:24 <kristhian>	https://termbin.com/24is
Sep 10 09:56:39 <kristhian>	wanted to open port 443
Sep 10 09:57:40 <kristhian>	i mean i wanted to allow traffic to it
Sep 10 10:06:23 <kristhian>	guys, why do you think it is not allowing traffic on 443? i installed ufw and attempted opening the as per 'https://www.vultr.com/docs/easy-iptables-configuration-and-examples-on-ubuntu-16-04' | result of iptables --list -n -v https://termbin.com/24is
Sep 10 10:08:11 <linux_probe>	no ssl certs
Sep 10 10:09:28 <linux_probe>	and probably not enabled in the config
Sep 10 10:09:37 <detha>	kristhian: why ufw? it just obfuscates what is actually going on, and makes things more difficult to debug

Sep 10 10:25:15 <kristhian>	is it possible that port 80 and 443 is not open on the network?
Sep 10 10:29:09 <Kim^J>	kristhian: Is apache running?
Sep 10 10:30:28 <kristhian>	nope
Sep 10 10:30:36 <kristhian>	aw yes
Sep 10 10:30:38 <Kim^J>	Well... Then you won't have anything listening.
Sep 10 10:30:40 <kristhian>	but is not accessible
Sep 10 10:30:59 <Kim^J>	"netstat -tulpn" shows 80 and 443 for apache?
Sep 10 10:31:03 <spinningCat>	hey there
Sep 10 10:33:45 <kristhian>	Kim^J, non
Sep 10 10:34:47 <spinningCat>	hmm
Sep 10 10:35:02 <spinningCat>	is external ip static?
Sep 10 10:35:22 <spinningCat>	if i close router will external ip change?
Sep 10 10:37:28 <Kim^J>	spinningCat: That depends on what the provider does.
Sep 10 10:37:44 <Kim^J>	They can assign static IPs to the router or they release quickly.
Sep 10 10:38:00 <Kim^J>	kristhian: Well, that's your first problem. You don't have anything listening to port 80 and 443.
Sep 10 10:39:13 <spinningCat>	so if i want static ip on router i need to contact with provider
Sep 10 10:39:42 <tatertots>	ask your ISP for a static ip
Sep 10 10:39:49 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 10 10:44:19 <Kim^J>	spinningCat: Why do you want a static IP?
Sep 10 10:44:43 <spinningCat>	well place has electricy problem
Sep 10 10:45:15 <spinningCat>	and we need to start router if electricycity is gone off
Sep 10 10:45:27 <spinningCat>	so there is server machine and we cannot access them
Sep 10 10:46:17 <Kim^J>	How are you going to start the router if it's off?
Sep 10 10:46:39 <tatertots>	lol..you all in that mans business
Sep 10 10:47:17 <spinningCat>	Kim^J,  someone will start that
Sep 10 10:47:30 <spinningCat>	buit will be manual operation
Sep 10 10:48:12 <spinningCat>	but i dont want to configure nat, rdp, ssh again and again
Sep 10 10:52:22 <Kim^J>	spinningCat: So, let the router update a DNS record.
Sep 10 10:52:34 <Kim^J>	And use that rather than IP.
Sep 10 10:52:45 <edmont>	hi
Sep 10 10:54:40 <spinningCat>	dont know how to configure this
Sep 10 10:54:47 <edmont>	ip -6 maddr show dev enx8404d2000026 | grep ff03::2
Sep 10 10:54:49 <edmont>	        inet6 ff03::2
Sep 10 10:54:51 <spinningCat>	but in that case i need to change nat table in every turn
Sep 10 10:55:00 <edmont>	lsof -i6 -n | grep ff03::2
Sep 10 10:55:07 <edmont>	python      301  root   26u  IPv6 313721      0t0  UDP [ff03::2]:61631
Sep 10 10:55:14 <spinningCat>	right

Sep 10 10:55:41 <edmont>	why I'm getting this error?
Sep 10 10:56:12 <theluckymike>	please use pastebin or such for pasting code and terminal results
Sep 10 10:56:43 <tatertots>	edmont: what are you attempting to do when the error occurs?
Sep 10 10:57:01 <tatertots>	edmont: if you NOT do it...does error persist?
Sep 10 10:57:09 <edmont>	https://pastebin.com/6HrfSA0a
Sep 10 10:57:40 <edmont>	tatertots just sending UDP packet to that multicast address
Sep 10 10:57:44 <tatertots>	edmont: what are you trying to do when this error occurs?
Sep 10 10:58:04 <giaco>	hello. What options do I have to make a service available from a natted/firewalled ip? I know tor hidden service, ssh tunnel, vpn. What else?
Sep 10 10:58:04 <_BIGSHOT_>	hey tatertots you mentioned get-networkprofile, how can i use it to switch from lan to wifi?
Sep 10 10:58:23 <tatertots>	edmont: if you stop doing that...do the errors continue?
Sep 10 10:58:57 <edmont>	tatertots it's a single command
Sep 10 11:01:04 <tatertots>	sounds like the person issuing commands, is causing the error
Sep 10 11:01:30 <tatertots>	oops i mean the commands are causing error
Sep 10 11:01:43 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, you der bud
Sep 10 11:02:33 <tatertots>	_BIGSHOT_: i'm here, do you have access to your problematic environment right now?
Sep 10 11:02:38 <_BIGSHOT_>	yes
Sep 10 11:03:15 <noID>	hi
Sep 10 11:03:16 <tatertots>	_BIGSHOT_: you'll need to know how to get stuff from powershell into a pastebin....can you do that?...show me
Sep 10 11:03:20 <_BIGSHOT_>	it's not problematic only thing is that i've to pull lan cable out
Sep 10 11:03:34 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, that's fine where do you want me to paste it?
Sep 10 11:04:34 <tatertots>	of course you have to pull the LAN cable out, you've got both wlan and lan adapters configured for auto/dhcp
Sep 10 11:04:43 <_BIGSHOT_>	yes tatertots
Sep 10 11:05:01 <kristhian>	ok, got it now
Sep 10 11:05:04 <tatertots>	with both adapters setup for auto ip / dhcp...i'd expect you to have that promblem
Sep 10 11:05:15 <_BIGSHOT_>	what is the fix thne?
Sep 10 11:05:19 <noID>	hi, only 1 short question: d-link switch 1008p(unmanaged-desktop) this is without web interface and no lan-ip address?
Sep 10 11:05:22 <kristhian>	thanks Kim^J
Sep 10 11:05:56 <tatertots>	you should use a static ip so you're not trying to have wlan set to auto ip and the lan/wired connection...you're kinda stepping on your own toes by having both set to auto ip/dhcp
Sep 10 11:06:28 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, ok ok but how is the solution which nic should get static ip?
Sep 10 11:06:44 <detha>	noID: 'unmanaged' generally means 'no web/CLI, just a dumb L2 switch'
Sep 10 11:07:11 <tatertots>	_BIGSHOT_: termbin.com
Sep 10 11:07:15 <_BIGSHOT_>	ok
Sep 10 11:07:42 <_BIGSHOT_>	termbin is blocked
Sep 10 11:08:30 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, https://smulpuru.wordpress.com/2018/08/10/force-traffic-through-a-network-interface-windows-8/
Sep 10 11:09:25 <_BIGSHOT_>	yo yo tatertots you der?
Sep 10 11:10:33 <noID>	detha: than no ip? not pingable?
Sep 10 11:11:44 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, u der?
Sep 10 11:12:10 <_BIGSHOT_>	holyschmolyGuakamoly
Sep 10 11:12:16 <tatertots>	i'm here
Sep 10 11:12:22 <_BIGSHOT_>	sow hat do you want
Sep 10 11:12:22 <_BIGSHOT_>	?
Sep 10 11:13:09 <tatertots>	Get-NetAdapter
Sep 10 11:13:31 <tatertots>	you can sanitize out put in pastebin if you want
Sep 10 11:13:51 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, i can do all that on my own just tell me what to do!
Sep 10 11:13:58 <tatertots>	you'd only sanitize the macs btw...just fyi
Sep 10 11:14:00 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, juz tell me yo solution
Sep 10 11:14:51 <tatertots>	fix your config...that's the solution..this isn't silver bullets and magic wands...is figuring out where you went wrong or if you're following a bogus forum or site you stumbled upon
Sep 10 11:15:46 <tatertots>	i told you about having both adapters set to auto...can you even confirm or deny that ?
Sep 10 11:15:50 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, https://hastebin.com/ijebinitaf.diff
Sep 10 11:16:07 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, yes they both are "auto"
Sep 10 11:16:10 <tatertots>	you fall short of providing that level of detail, yet you want some silver bullet or wave of a magic wand
Sep 10 11:16:16 <tatertots>	you'll need to debug
Sep 10 11:16:19 <tatertots>	and fix
Sep 10 11:16:37 <tatertots>	ain't no magic silver bullets
Sep 10 11:16:50 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, i posted get-netadapter results in that link
Sep 10 11:17:47 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, ?
Sep 10 11:17:56 <tatertots>	configure your wireless connection "manually"
Sep 10 11:18:16 <_BIGSHOT_>	ok then
Sep 10 11:18:34 <tatertots>	wlan is not in disconnected state...i expect it to be connected once you "successfully" apply a manual ip,mask,gw
Sep 10 11:19:13 <tatertots>	then you should have a destination ip you can ping to validate
Sep 10 11:20:09 <tatertots>	if all that sounds like greek, just know you'll be making some more pastebins and if you're not comfy with that...google is your friend
Sep 10 11:20:33 <Kim^J>	spinningCat: Why would you need to change NAT table? :S
Sep 10 11:21:25 <tatertots>	_BIGSHOT_: have you successfully applied a manual static ip to the wlan adapter?
Sep 10 11:22:17 <detha>	noID: correct
Sep 10 11:22:39 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, is it ok if i configure WLAN as AUTO and LAN as Manual?
Sep 10 11:23:00 <_BIGSHOT_>	cause my wifi is from a android phone
Sep 10 11:24:26 <tatertots>	your pastebin shows a working wired connection, and you want to get your little fingers on it to ruin it so bad...j/k...ideally if you truly need both at the same time, you'd give attention to the one that is DOWN
Sep 10 11:24:31 <tatertots>	which is wlan
Sep 10 11:25:02 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, but i can't give static ip coz it is from android phone
Sep 10 11:25:04 <_BIGSHOT_>	to wlan
Sep 10 11:25:19 <tatertots>	else you'll break wired and then be sitting there wanting me to wave some magic wand to undo what you did
Sep 10 11:25:32 <_BIGSHOT_>	no that's fine i can fix it
Sep 10 11:25:57 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, so i'll configure my router to give static ip to my computer
Sep 10 11:26:10 <_BIGSHOT_>	lan i.e.
Sep 10 11:26:23 <tatertots>	why can't you? nothing is stopping you from statically assigning the same ip given by the dhcp from the hotspot
Sep 10 11:26:26 <tatertots>	techincally
Sep 10 11:26:40 <_BIGSHOT_>	i couldnt' find such setting in android phone
Sep 10 11:26:45 <tatertots>	technically nothing is preventing you from assigning that ip
Sep 10 11:27:13 <tatertots>	because you'd set the static ip on the WIdnows 10 "end point" device not the hotspot
Sep 10 11:27:20 <tatertots>	not the hotspot/phone
Sep 10 11:27:49 <_BIGSHOT_>	how to do that
Sep 10 11:27:55 <_BIGSHOT_>	i mean what should gateway and ip be?
Sep 10 11:27:57 <tatertots>	you'd be assigning a static ip to the wlan adapter in Windows 10\
Sep 10 11:28:34 <tatertots>	use the identical gatway value
Sep 10 11:28:40 <tatertots>	same SSID
Sep 10 11:28:52 <tatertots>	only with static manual entry
Sep 10 11:29:01 <noID>	detha: thank you!: )
Sep 10 11:29:55 <tatertots>	you wanna do it in GUI or powershell?
Sep 10 11:30:13 <tatertots>	GUI might be faster ...you might be done by now
Sep 10 11:34:44 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, https://hastebin.com/zurebujehu.css
Sep 10 11:34:47 <_BIGSHOT_>	now what to do?
Sep 10 11:34:52 <_BIGSHOT_>	wifi is overtaking LAN connection
Sep 10 11:35:04 <_BIGSHOT_>	i see "WiFI" icon in systems tray
Sep 10 11:36:13 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, you der bud?
Sep 10 11:39:00 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, !!????
Sep 10 11:46:18 <niceGuy00_>	tatertots, u der?
Sep 10 11:50:56 <tatertots>	yep
Sep 10 11:51:56 <tatertots>	now the wired cabled remains plugged in and wlan is also connected state
Sep 10 11:52:12 <_BIGSHOT_>	so
Sep 10 11:52:47 <_BIGSHOT_>	i added wlan manually but still i have to remove lan cable to get wlan internet
Sep 10 11:53:44 <tatertots>	do you know your gateway address?
Sep 10 11:53:48 <_BIGSHOT_>	yes
Sep 10 11:54:16 <tatertots>	are both wlan and lan still BOTH connected as shown in previous pastebin?
Sep 10 11:54:24 <_BIGSHOT_>	yes
Sep 10 11:54:34 <tatertots>	ping your gateway ip
Sep 10 11:54:45 <tatertots>	%0 loss?
Sep 10 11:55:11 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots, yes i can ping both gateways
Sep 10 11:56:18 <tatertots>	tell me "both" gateways...you need to figure out which ONE to use default to the internet
Sep 10 11:56:24 <tatertots>	both is NOT an option
Sep 10 11:56:41 <_BIGSHOT_>	LAN
Sep 10 11:56:51 <_BIGSHOT_>	LAN gateway should be used as Default
Sep 10 11:57:32 <_BIGSHOT_>	tatertots,
Sep 10 11:57:40 <tatertots>	when i say ping your gateway...that means to "internet"...
Sep 10 11:58:35 <_BIGSHOT_>	right now it is going through WLAN
Sep 10 11:58:43 <_BIGSHOT_>	WLAN gateway is used currently
Sep 10 11:58:48 <_BIGSHOT_>	but i want LAN gateway
Sep 10 11:58:58 <tatertots>	choose 1
Sep 10 11:59:04 <_BIGSHOT_>	LAN
Sep 10 11:59:10 <_BIGSHOT_>	LAN gateway bud
Sep 10 11:59:19 <tatertots>	stop using the other
Sep 10 11:59:41 <_BIGSHOT_>	??
Sep 10 11:59:51 <_BIGSHOT_>	ok
Sep 10 12:01:11 <tatertots>	if you need internet from a phone hotspot..what interest do you have on LAN?
Sep 10 12:01:13 <tatertots>	specifically
Sep 10 12:01:34 <niceGuy00_>	only use hotspot in case of failover
Sep 10 12:01:38 <niceGuy00_>	otherwise keep on using LAN
Sep 10 12:01:39 <tatertots>	and if LAN can supply internet...put the hotspot away
Sep 10 12:01:55 <tatertots>	don't make your life harder than it needs to be
Sep 10 12:02:03 <djph>	Windows (desktop) doesn't have the capability to do that.  We've been over this.
Sep 10 12:02:37 <niceGuy00_>	oh screw it
Sep 10 12:02:56 <niceGuy00_>	i thought tatertots has some deep understanding along w/ magical wand
Sep 10 12:03:01 <tatertots>	there is a way to go about having High available WAN/redundancy...but what you're doing isn't it
Sep 10 12:03:44 <djph>	^ a few scripts on a decently-capable router are my preferred method.
Sep 10 12:06:54 <tatertots>	i get why a business can't suffer downtime and easily justify costs of HA, but at home i don't use it..my home LAN support 4G LTE failover if main connection goes down but i don't have it enabled
Sep 10 12:07:16 <tatertots>	i refuse to pay an additional 4G LTE cellular bill for failover lol
Sep 10 12:07:24 <tatertots>	it ain't that serious at home
Sep 10 12:09:34 <tatertots>	that's kinda adorable if thats what bigshot was thinking he was gonna do with his cellular hot spot and his LAN
Sep 10 12:13:59 <light>	very_sneaky: i see you o.o
Sep 10 12:14:20 <very_sneaky>	D:
Sep 10 12:15:13 <djph>	tatertots: it was.  At least with one PC anyway.
Sep 10 12:15:26 <tatertots>	lol
Sep 10 12:16:12 <djph>	tatertots: although, this is the first I'd heard it was a completely different WAN connection.  He'd always previously just said it was LAN & Wifi
Sep 10 12:18:00 <tatertots>	it probably isn't ..i doubt he truly has two different unique ISP connection in the home...i.e COX and AT&T or Verizon and AT&T DSL
Sep 10 12:18:19 <tatertots>	he probably got a couple routers and did some weird stuff
Sep 10 12:18:49 <djph>	Well, now that it's LAN and "phone hotspot", things make some sense
Sep 10 12:20:16 <tatertots>	he wouldn't reveal his "two" gateways numerically, which i guess is normal given were on irc with strangers
Sep 10 12:20:46 <tatertots>	that's what kinda makes me think he did something with two old routers he had laying around
Sep 10 12:21:18 <tatertots>	maybe like 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.1
Sep 10 12:21:38 <tatertots>	i kinda hope he comes back after my coffee is done
Sep 10 12:23:58 <spinningCat>	https://i.itsosticky.com/3am0c.pngis /24 a port number?
Sep 10 12:24:15 <djph>	spinningCat: "/24" is a CIDR netmask
Sep 10 12:25:53 <spinningCat>	dont know what CIDR?
Sep 10 12:26:15 <spinningCat>	ah
Sep 10 12:26:35 <spinningCat>	is that like 206 - 230 ?
Sep 10 12:26:41 <spinningCat>	you mean the ip range?
Sep 10 12:28:48 <djph>	"CIDR" is "Classless Inter-Domain Routing"
Sep 10 12:29:19 <djph>	for the sake of simplicity, you can think of it as shorthand for writing out netmasks.
Sep 10 12:29:21 <spinningCat>	i just try to set static ip
Sep 10 12:29:49 <spinningCat>	so 24 is netmask
Sep 10 12:30:02 <djph>	well "/24" is the netmask
Sep 10 12:30:07 <spinningCat>	so if i remember correctly nmetmak is like 255.255.255.0
Sep 10 12:30:14 <djph>	yep
Sep 10 12:30:31 <djph>	which, coincidentally is the longhand of "/24"
Sep 10 12:30:47 <spinningCat>	i see
Sep 10 12:30:53 <spinningCat>	so /24 is constant
Sep 10 12:31:11 <spinningCat>	is like constant
Sep 10 12:31:13 <spinningCat>	anyway
Sep 10 12:31:21 <spinningCat>	shorthand of 255.255.255.0
Sep 10 12:31:38 <djph>	well, "constant"
Sep 10 12:34:24 <snappy>	er Prue Vines
Sep 10 12:34:31 <spinningCat>	i am using ubuntu
Sep 10 12:35:17 <spinningCat>	well i read the link https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-configure-a-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu-server-18-04/
Sep 10 12:35:35 <spinningCat>	i guess file wont work if i do mistake in indentation
Sep 10 12:35:47 <spinningCat>	i dont know how to check indentation in terminal
Sep 10 12:37:40 <djph>	indentation doesn't matter in /etc/network/interfaces
Sep 10 12:37:49 <xand>	it matters in a netplan yaml file
Sep 10 12:37:54 <spinningCat>	this is yaml file
Sep 10 12:38:10 <xand>	use "netplan try"?
Sep 10 12:38:40 <spinningCat>	okay
Sep 10 12:39:22 <djph>	pfft
Sep 10 12:39:34 <xand>	netplan is ick
Sep 10 12:39:50 <xand>	pointless config in front of systemd-networkd
Sep 10 12:40:35 <spinningCat>	ick?
Sep 10 12:40:51 <spinningCat>	xand, any other way to set staci ip
Sep 10 12:40:54 <spinningCat>	?
Sep 10 12:41:02 <djph>	xand: so pointless config in front of pointless config then, eh?
Sep 10 12:41:30 <spinningCat>	two configs??
Sep 10 12:41:52 <xand>	spinningCat: be more careful with your YAML
Sep 10 12:42:04 <xand>	otherwise install ifupdown and do the config that way
Sep 10 12:43:19 <spinningCat>	ifupdown is easier
Sep 10 12:44:21 <spinningCat>	?
Sep 10 12:47:03 <detha>	for basic configs, ifupdown is a lot easier
Sep 10 12:48:01 <detha>	and still nobody has written an iproute2 backend for netplan
Sep 10 12:48:15 <spinningCat>	so for advanced config i need netplan
Sep 10 12:49:20 <spinningCat>	?
Sep 10 12:49:41 <detha>	for medium advanced, netplan. I don't think it can deal with advanced configs yet
Sep 10 12:49:43 <tatertots>	a static ip is considered "advanced" now?...lol
Sep 10 12:51:07 <tatertots>	I don't see anything that suggest anything more than your desire for a static ip on your 18.04
Sep 10 12:51:09 <detha>	static: basic. couple of interfaces, maybe some vlans: medium. vlans over LAGs in different namespaces: advanced.
Sep 10 12:51:18 <LambdaComplex>	how long until canonical decides netplan was a mistake?
Sep 10 12:51:22 <LambdaComplex>	y'know, like with upstart
Sep 10 12:51:50 <spinningCat>	i just need static ip because sometimes electricity goes off
Sep 10 12:51:57 <tatertots>	spinningCat: which interface on 18.04 you want static ip on?
Sep 10 12:52:02 <spinningCat>	and i dont want to see new ip assigned
Sep 10 12:52:30 <spinningCat>	i want static ip using with ssh?
Sep 10 12:52:31 <detha>	spinningCat: can't you just put a reservation on the DHCP server?
Sep 10 12:52:53 <spinningCat>	detha,  i am just looking for solution
Sep 10 12:52:55 <LambdaComplex>	static dhcp reservations would be an option here
Sep 10 12:53:06 <LambdaComplex>	honestly though i'm pretty sure netplan is garbage and using ifupdown is a good idea
Sep 10 12:53:19 *	LambdaComplex googles "netplan static ip"
Sep 10 12:53:37 <spinningCat>	i plan to do that with ipupdown now
Sep 10 12:53:49 *	LambdaComplex clicks on https://www.tecmint.com/configure-network-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu/
Sep 10 12:54:09 <LambdaComplex>	well that doesn't look difficult anyways
Sep 10 12:54:18 <LambdaComplex>	i'd still use ifupdown personally though
Sep 10 12:54:21 <LambdaComplex>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Sep 10 12:54:37 <spinningCat>	why?
Sep 10 12:55:25 <LambdaComplex>	because ifupdown is the system that debian has used for ages and i know it works, whereas netplan is quite possibly another terrible idea from canonical that will get scrapped in a major version or two. and it probably still has bugs
Sep 10 12:55:46 <LambdaComplex>	iirc one of my coworkers had some issues doing vlan configuration with it or something like that. idk, i'll look that up
Sep 10 12:56:51 <LambdaComplex>	oh, might've been setting the DNS server at runtime that was giving him trouble
Sep 10 12:56:53 <spinningCat>	gateways is router interface ip right?
Sep 10 12:57:03 <tatertots>	why
Sep 10 12:57:08 <tatertots>	lol
Sep 10 12:58:05 <LambdaComplex>	spinningCat: yes
Sep 10 12:58:08 <LambdaComplex>	tatertots: why what
Sep 10 12:58:54 <spinningCat>	https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/ubuntu-how-tos/netplan-how-to-configure-static-ip-address-in-ubuntu-18-04-using-netplan.html
Sep 10 12:59:04 <spinningCat>	there is two dnms-nameservers and dns-search
Sep 10 12:59:18 <spinningCat>	do i need to write thos lines to interface file?
Sep 10 13:00:50 <LambdaComplex>	you'll need at least one dns-nameservers entry
Sep 10 13:00:53 <LambdaComplex>	dns-search is not required
Sep 10 13:01:17 <LambdaComplex>	google's nameservers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are commonly used, as are cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
Sep 10 13:02:51 <spinningCat>	what do you suggest?
Sep 10 13:03:39 <LambdaComplex>	i normally just use 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
Sep 10 13:04:03 <freakynl>	Those have issues if you use RBL's like spamhaus
Sep 10 13:04:12 <spinningCat>	wut
Sep 10 13:04:24 <LambdaComplex>	...wut
Sep 10 13:04:29 <tatertots>	i don't think spinningCat is doing anything like that
Sep 10 13:04:47 <LambdaComplex>	i haven't heard of those being used outside the context of email servers
Sep 10 13:04:50 <LambdaComplex>	soooooo i'm confused now
Sep 10 13:04:52 <LambdaComplex>	what are we talking about
Sep 10 13:04:57 <spinningCat>	i am just connecting my machine with ssh
Sep 10 13:04:58 <tatertots>	he just wants his 18.04 to have a static ip
Sep 10 13:05:13 <tatertots>	eggs over easy
Sep 10 13:05:16 <spinningCat>	tatertots,  ^^
Sep 10 13:05:33 <spinningCat>	if server restart unexpectedly
Sep 10 13:05:50 <spinningCat>	i have nat deifinition o router interface
Sep 10 13:06:02 <spinningCat>	and i dont want to see ip changes
Sep 10 13:06:15 <spinningCat>	so i can connect yo my machine with same ip everytime
Sep 10 13:06:24 <LambdaComplex>	tatertots: <----- ##cooking is that way!!
Sep 10 13:06:25 <spinningCat>	this is the purpose of static ip right?
Sep 10 13:06:39 <tatertots>	less is more spinningCat , revealing too much of your thoughts and ideas will get folk off track, and more importantly get YOU off track..get that static ip set and go for a jog
Sep 10 13:06:43 <LambdaComplex>	uh...yes, the purpose of having an IP that doesn't change is having an IP that doesn't change
Sep 10 13:06:43 <tatertots>	or go eat
Sep 10 13:07:15 <spinningCat>	tatertots,  i will keep that in my mind
Sep 10 13:08:00 <tatertots>	you want to avoid rambling about acronym acb 123 nat's because you haven't managed to succeed merely setting a static ip in 18.04 yet
Sep 10 13:08:22 <tatertots>	accomplish that first...then moveon
Sep 10 13:08:23 <uio>	Could you recommend a Debian compatible 2/3/4G internet stick? I don't know anything about all this...
Sep 10 13:08:32 <spinningCat>	i dont have networking serivce
Sep 10 13:11:05 <TJ->	uio:  you've got 3 things to consider. 1) Does the device present as a serial port (/dev/ttyACM*) or a USB CDC Ethernet port (e.g. ethxaabbccddeeff) 2) does it require usb_modeswitch to change from virtual CD-ROM mode to modem mode 3) does it act as a gateway/router (doing NAT, DNS, etc.) or does it expect the PC to handle that
Sep 10 13:11:47 <TJ->	uio:  as to models... most these days do require usb_modeswitch so that'd be the project to check for compatible devices.
Sep 10 13:12:27 <uio>	TJ-, Hmmm. Okay.
Sep 10 13:12:33 <freakynl>	Yes, RBL's are used on mailservers. Spamhaus sells subscriptions and as such imposes limits on the number of queries / per amount of time an IP can do for free usage (or at least they used to, it's been a while). As 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are used a lot they're nearly always at the limit
Sep 10 13:12:45 <TJ->	uio:  the virtual CD-ROM mode is to allow it to carry Windows drivers which once installed know how to do the mode-switch to modem mode. Linux doesn't use those drivers so the usb_modeswitch service has to know about the device's USB ID(s) and how to command the switch
Sep 10 13:13:05 <shtrb>	uio, do you need a wan capable device or you are ok with /dev/ttyUSB or /dev/ttyACM ?
Sep 10 13:13:11 <uio>	TJ-, I don't have Windows on my machines, so I guess that first one is not an option...
Sep 10 13:13:48 <shtrb>	Do you really need 2G ? and will you be ok with a 3G to 3.75 or even an LTE modem
Sep 10 13:13:50 <TJ->	uio:  I'd go for one that presents a virtual CDC Ethernet device and does gateway/DNS
Sep 10 13:13:59 <Goop>	I have no professional experience with anything to do with computers, but I have been playing around with Linux/websites/security concepts for the past 4 years. If I get a Security+ and a Linux+, what are my chances of getting a tech job, and how much would I expect to earn in the United States?
Sep 10 13:14:18 <light>	you can get a helpdesk job earning minimum wage
Sep 10 13:14:25 <light>	then work your way up
Sep 10 13:15:03 <uio>	shtrb, (Hello again!) To be honest I don't know... To describe the situation: At work the WiFi is non-existant. I don't have a smartphone. I need interent sometimes and was wondering what my options were.
Sep 10 13:15:05 <shtrb>	I second TJ- recommendation about one that will give you a cdc , it is the most easy way to handle them for first devices.
Sep 10 13:15:18 <LambdaComplex>	fwiw i managed to get a job that's kinda sorta helpdesk ("technical support") and i'm making like 3x minimum wage
Sep 10 13:15:26 <LambdaComplex>	but i also have to do networking stuff and rack servers in a datacenter
Sep 10 13:15:28 <LambdaComplex>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Sep 10 13:15:44 <uio>	From what I've heard one can create WiFi with a smartphone (hotspot). It the equivalent possible without a smartphone?
Sep 10 13:16:10 <djph>	uio: sure, grab any wifi access point, and plug it into a LAN.
Sep 10 13:16:13 <djph>	boom, WiFi
Sep 10 13:16:57 <light>	make sure the access point is open too, so everyone can share from adjacent businesses
Sep 10 13:17:02 <shtrb>	uio , I used in the past and current day MA180 , Huawei LTE , MS2372h , Nokia E72. all work with Debian reception and support are questionable
Sep 10 13:17:06 <light>	your network admin will love it
Sep 10 13:17:17 <bezaban>	ports marked mgmt are the best
Sep 10 13:17:20 <djph>	^
Sep 10 13:17:34 <uio>	djph, light lol ( you are joking.... right??)
Sep 10 13:17:40 <shtrb>	ofc
Sep 10 13:18:02 <light>	uio: tell them you need another ap near your office
Sep 10 13:18:14 <light>	they can check signal strengths and take care of it for you
Sep 10 13:18:39 <djph>	uio: realistically, what *exactly* are you trying to accomplish?
Sep 10 13:18:39 <uio>	light, Oh, tech support is  not great where I am...
Sep 10 13:18:48 <light>	tech support is not great anywhere
Sep 10 13:18:52 <djph>	uio: well, at least you live on planet earth.
Sep 10 13:19:04 <TJ->	uio: so is there Wifi but it doesn't reach your working area, or no Wifi at all?
Sep 10 13:19:05 <uio>	djph,  To describe the situation: At work the WiFi is non-existant. I don't have a smartphone. I need interent sometimes and was wondering what my options were.
Sep 10 13:19:14 <shtrb>	uio , grab a pizza slice and befrined the IT guys , ask for a sane connection LAN is prefereable
Sep 10 13:19:16 <djph>	plug into work's LAN, duh.
Sep 10 13:19:26 <djph>	wait,
Sep 10 13:19:36 <shtrb>	Why don't you use LAN ports ?
Sep 10 13:19:44 <light>	uio: pocket wifi
Sep 10 13:19:49 <djph>	yeah, why isn't your (work) PC already on the LAN?
Sep 10 13:19:51 <TJ->	the PC might not have an RJ45 connector :)
Sep 10 13:20:04 <light>	uio: why do you want internet instead of your work's lan?
Sep 10 13:20:05 <shtrb>	and that is why we carry the dongle
Sep 10 13:20:15 <uio>	There is wifi... but the there are like 12 routers with 12 passwords and the one near me is visible, but I can't connect. Apparently it's broken. lol
Sep 10 13:20:24 <Goop>	light, LambdaComplex, so I have a book on Security+, but it is taking *forever* to get through it, since I am taking notes (so I don't forget anything before the test). It is taking me 30 minutes to flip each page.
Sep 10 13:20:35 <uio>	light, There is no LAN in my office/workspace
Sep 10 13:20:38 <LambdaComplex>	i'm honestly not familiar at all with what Security+ covers
Sep 10 13:20:48 <light>	uio: you have no lan and no wifi?
Sep 10 13:20:53 <LambdaComplex>	uio: so how do you have internet
Sep 10 13:20:56 <TJ->	uio:  so, "Boss, the AP near me isn't working so I cannot access the network which I need to do for Project X"  Boss > IT "Get it fixed"
Sep 10 13:20:57 <light>	so... why do you need the internet while working?
Sep 10 13:20:58 <LambdaComplex>	what do you even use your computers for???
Sep 10 13:21:00 <shtrb>	uio, grab any Wifi in the IT deparment , take a 4 meter usb cable and connect it to your laptop .
Sep 10 13:21:07 <uio>	light, Broken wifi with a complex Proxy process.
Sep 10 13:21:24 <uio>	light, Research.
Sep 10 13:21:25 <shtrb>	Any usb wifi dongle
Sep 10 13:21:31 <light>	researching dat ass?
Sep 10 13:22:18 <shtrb>	If you area is covered by WISP you can use your laptop wifi as a customer.
Sep 10 13:22:22 <shtrb>	uio^
Sep 10 13:22:40 <light>	have you tried sneakernet?
Sep 10 13:22:46 <uio>	shtrb, Okay, that's interesting. There are two desktop computers and a router beside it. Could they emit a wifi signal
Sep 10 13:23:07 <tatertots>	if your work doesn't even supply you with a corporate smartphone, you probably don't really "need" internet as much as you think you do
Sep 10 13:23:49 <tatertots>	your employer doesn't think it's very business critical that you be "connected' constantly to do your job
Sep 10 13:23:50 <shtrb>	all IT be like BYOD is dead , only our stuff allowed
Sep 10 13:24:08 <shtrb>	uio, talk to your IT dep.
Sep 10 13:24:54 <uio>	tatertots, shtrb light TJ- Thanks for the input! I hope wifi will come back soon...
Sep 10 13:25:17 <shtrb>	!next
Sep 10 13:25:29 <light>	uio: you can get a sim card and stick it in a pocket wifi device, a little 4g modem that will allow any device capable of wifi connectivity to connect
Sep 10 13:25:52 <uio>	shtrb, lol, but one last question: in theory can one plug some WiFi stick into a modem and then get a WiFi network?
Sep 10 13:25:58 <shtrb>	no need for even a Wifi , just a 4G modem that is plugged into his laptop
Sep 10 13:26:08 <uio>	light, Cool. Any hardware suggestions?
Sep 10 13:26:08 <light>	yes
Sep 10 13:26:19 <light>	whatever they have available en france
Sep 10 13:26:26 <uio>	light, IP snooper :)
Sep 10 13:26:35 <shtrb>	uio, it is more complex then that. but the Wingle brand is exactly that (a modem tied to Wifi router on a SoC )
Sep 10 13:26:45 <uio>	SoC?
Sep 10 13:26:46 <light>	wherever you get your sim will probably also sell such a device
Sep 10 13:26:51 <shtrb>	System on Chip
Sep 10 13:26:57 <uio>	shtrb, Thanks.
Sep 10 13:27:38 <shtrb>	You can also just connect to Free telecom , you can use them like a WISP
Sep 10 13:27:49 <shtrb>	*Wireless ISP
Sep 10 13:28:12 <shtrb>	just make sure they cover your area
Sep 10 13:28:37 <uio>	shtrb, Cool. I guess the free (as in no money) is the Wingle thing, and the Free WISP would bea like €10 per month.
Sep 10 13:29:38 <tatertots>	thats a good deal
Sep 10 13:29:47 <shtrb>	no , Free is a company in France that provide WiFi hotspot you can connect. The Wingle is Huawei brand for a modem that is also wifi router
Sep 10 13:29:59 <shtrb>	If you have Wingle no need to be Free telecom customer
Sep 10 13:30:18 <shtrb>	https://www.free.fr/freebox/index.html
Sep 10 13:31:10 <uio>	Thanks everyone for your help!
Sep 10 13:31:34 <shtrb>	uio, and https://consumer.huawei.com/en/mobile-broadband/e8372/ for a device example (but you can and shop in other places )
Sep 10 13:32:05 <uio>	shtrb, Cool! Good to know.
Sep 10 13:32:18 <uio>	Is this channel M$-friendly?
Sep 10 13:32:34 <light>	you mean Microsoft friendly?
Sep 10 13:32:44 <uio>	I ask because ' If you want to paste use https://paste.debian.net' this suggest otherwise :p
Sep 10 13:32:54 <squ>	what
Sep 10 13:33:04 <uio>	light, Sorry, yes Microsoft :)
Sep 10 13:33:05 <light>	well you can use paste.microsoft.com when they implement it
Sep 10 13:33:06 <shtrb>	Why would you think that ? Microsoft even ship it's own version of debian
Sep 10 13:33:10 <uio>	light, lol
Sep 10 13:33:18 <uio>	shtrb, ??
Sep 10 13:33:26 <shtrb>	what ?
Sep 10 13:33:27 <squ>	uio: are there channels which prohibit urls from that site?
Sep 10 13:34:07 <uio>	It's would just be funny to get support for Windows using debian paste. IMO.
Sep 10 13:34:20 <uio>	Not prohibited, just amusing.
Sep 10 13:34:24 <shtrb>	uio , https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/debian/9msvkqc78pk6
Sep 10 13:35:11 <squ>	shtrb: is that like msys command line utility?
Sep 10 13:35:12 <uio>	shtrb, What! I don't understand anything anymore!
Sep 10 13:35:53 <uio>	shtrb, I don't what to think. Is that good? Is that just M$ trying to make money off Debian? Work on their image? Wow.
Sep 10 13:36:15 <shtrb>	squ, worse , that is like Wine (is not an emulator) on acid, they will even soon to support kernel modules
Sep 10 13:36:24 <uio>	shtrb, lol
Sep 10 13:36:30 <squ>	uio: you sound like brainwashed
Sep 10 13:36:31 <shtrb>	uio, we are grownups, use the proper name
Sep 10 13:36:47 <uio>	shtrb, Which name?
Sep 10 13:36:54 <shtrb>	Microsoft
Sep 10 13:36:58 <uio>	squ, How so?
Sep 10 13:37:20 <shtrb>	squ, it's a subsystem that allow you to run nativly compiled ELFs
Sep 10 13:37:21 <squ>	shtrb: good to know, just in case
Sep 10 13:37:40 <uio>	shtrb, Come on now, a little abbreviation does not make one a child.
Sep 10 13:39:32 <shtrb>	uio, wasn't you the guy who complained when people used the word gentleman ?
Sep 10 13:39:35 <uio>	squ, https://betanews.com/2018/03/06/debian-linux-windows/
Sep 10 13:40:14 <uio>	shtrb, I'm not getting into that here. Totally different subject.
Sep 10 13:40:48 <shtrb>	lol , ok
Sep 10 13:41:04 <uio>	lol, good
Sep 10 13:42:10 <banisterfiend>	when displaying the routing table using netstat (`netstat -nr`) it displays the routes in a certain order -- does anyone know what determines this order?
Sep 10 13:42:57 <light>	netstat is old, use ip route
Sep 10 13:47:50 <SpaghettiCat>	Hello, when a router receives a n IP packet, how does it know whether the packet is destined for itself or to be forwarded on out into the internet?
Sep 10 13:48:57 <tds>	by doing a lookup in its routing table
Sep 10 13:49:34 <SpaghettiCat>	I read in a book that the IP destination address in the IP datagram is sent empty when the IP packet is destined for a host outside of the local network.... but then how would the router know where to send the packet....
Sep 10 13:49:51 <SpaghettiCat>	So the book seems wrong (or I misunderstood the book)
Sep 10 13:49:55 <djph>	SpaghettiCat: that's incorrect.
Sep 10 13:50:25 <SpaghettiCat>	Thanks for the confirmation, I'll strike that from my notes
Sep 10 13:54:57 <Skyl3r>	Hello - I'm trying to find out if a device will be capable of connecting to a WiFi network. The person who runs the WiFi network told me there's no authentication needed beyond WPA, but they gave me a username and password which I'm not used to seeing
Sep 10 13:55:30 <Skyl3r>	Is there a WPA protocol where you provide a username and password to authenticate?
Sep 10 13:55:37 <djph>	sounds like it's WPA-Enterprise
Sep 10 13:56:32 <Skyl3r>	Hmm, alright. I'll contact the device vendor and ask if it supports that. There's no obvious way to enter that information
Sep 10 13:57:32 <shtrb>	Skyl3r, user/password or smart card is the default option when you are connecting to a big network
Sep 10 13:58:04 <Skyl3r>	Okay
Sep 10 13:58:18 <Skyl3r>	They told me this is a guest network, so I guess I assumed too much

Sep 10 22:52:12 *	Topic for ##networking set by catphish!~J@unaffiliated/catphish (Mon Aug 28 19:50:39 2017)
Sep 10 22:52:12 *	Channel ##networking url: http://intercom.nanoSouffle.net/networking
Sep 10 23:02:10 <azonenberg>	catphish: when i was in grad school there was a DHCP server on campus at 1.1.1.1
Sep 10 23:02:15 <azonenberg>	that was fun to deal with
Sep 10 23:02:41 <azonenberg>	yes, that is a valid world-routable IP
Sep 10 23:02:44 <azonenberg>	no, campus did not own it
Sep 10 23:03:01 <azonenberg>	but it was an official IT dept router
Sep 10 23:10:10 <b1tninja>	its now a famous ip
Sep 10 23:10:12 <b1tninja>	cloudflares dns
Sep 10 23:10:25 <b1tninja>	it used to be like ntt or something in asia i believe
Sep 10 23:17:08 <catphish>	azonenberg: afaik 1.1.1.1 was reserved until recently, nobody wanted it because of the unroutability and junk test traffic, but now it's well known dns server
Sep 10 23:17:31 <Habbie>	it was not reserved
Sep 10 23:17:39 <Habbie>	it was -unused- because of all those risks
Sep 10 23:17:41 <Habbie>	but it was not reserved
Sep 10 23:18:14 <catphish>	well when i looked a few years ago it was marked by the registry as unusable
Sep 10 23:18:38 <catphish>	or as "experimental", or similar
Sep 10 23:18:55 <Habbie>	by iana?
Sep 10 23:18:56 <catphish>	reserved at the local level, not by any RFC
Sep 10 23:19:05 <catphish>	by RIPE iirc
Sep 10 23:19:16 <catphish>	but would have been a different RIR
Sep 10 23:19:18 <catphish>	i forget
Sep 10 23:19:40 <catphish>	it's still there
Sep 10 23:19:41 <catphish>	descr:          APNIC Research and Development
Sep 10 23:19:59 <Habbie>	APNIC, not RIPE, indeed
Sep 10 23:20:04 <catphish>	netname:        APNIC-LABS
Sep 10 23:20:04 <catphish>	descr:          APNIC and Cloudflare DNS Resolver project
Sep 10 23:20:10 <Habbie>	but that just says that APNIC R&D owns it
Sep 10 23:20:16 <Habbie>	not that the space itself is experimental or unusable
Sep 10 23:20:19 <catphish>	so yeah, reserved by APNIC as "experimental"
Sep 10 23:20:28 <catphish>	but yeah, technically usable, sure
Sep 10 23:20:31 <Habbie>	nothing that you pasted argues that :)
Sep 10 23:20:52 <Habbie>	i mean, i get why they stuck the R&D department with 1/8
Sep 10 23:21:00 <catphish>	i mean, "reserved" is just an english word, it has no technicl meaning
Sep 10 23:21:03 <Habbie>	but nothing says that the space is bad
Sep 10 23:21:09 <catphish>	it just means a registry isn't releasing it for general use
Sep 10 23:21:18 <Habbie>	reserved definitely has technical meanings at IANA
Sep 10 23:21:19 <catphish>	well it's bad for obvious reasons
Sep 10 23:21:23 <Habbie>	most of what they call 'reserved' is actually unusable
Sep 10 23:21:44 <Habbie>	https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml
Sep 10 23:21:46 <Habbie>	all of it, in fact
Sep 10 23:21:46 <azonenberg>	yeah but more to the point
Sep 10 23:21:54 <catphish>	i don't think any of it is black and white
Sep 10 23:21:56 <azonenberg>	it was actually being used as a dns server
Sep 10 23:22:04 <catphish>	240.0.0.0 is reserved, but there's nothing stopping me using it
Sep 10 23:22:19 <Habbie>	catphish, except 80% of the hardware and software you can buy
Sep 10 23:22:47 <catphish>	Habbie: right, so it all comes down to documenataion and agreement
Sep 10 23:22:54 <Habbie>	yes
Sep 10 23:23:00 <Habbie>	and there's been efforts to 'free' class E
Sep 10 23:23:31 <catphish>	i feel like one could make use of it, but i'm not sure how/why
Sep 10 23:23:32 <Habbie>	i.e. 240.0.0.0/4
Sep 10 23:24:03 <Habbie>	but the conclusions appear to have been 'there is too much deployed stuff out there that will not deal with it' and 'it would only delay the inevitable runout of ipv4 by a few months or years'
Sep 10 23:24:16 <catphish>	it's pretty well established that using it for general RIR use wouldn't have helped IPv4 exhaustion
Sep 10 23:24:39 <catphish>	(by any meaningful amount anyway)
Sep 10 23:24:47 <catphish>	because demand simply met supply
Sep 10 23:25:06 <catphish>	and yeah, the technical upheaval would have been excessive
Sep 10 23:25:30 <Habbie>	ack
Sep 10 23:25:50 <Habbie>	catphish, you might enjoy this https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/202494830-Pseudo-IPv4-Supporting-IPv6-addresses-in-legacy-IPv4-applications
Sep 10 23:25:55 <Habbie>	catphish, or it may make you cry, i cannot predict
Sep 10 23:26:00 <catphish>	and i think most other places where it could now be useful, ipv6 would be a better choice
Sep 10 23:26:16 <catphish>	like linux LANs
Sep 10 23:26:31 <Habbie>	isn't 1918 big enough for LANs?
Sep 10 23:26:45 <Habbie>	ignoring, indeed, that v6-you-own is way better for those
Sep 10 23:26:57 <tds>	I'm sure I've seen 25/8 used internally in places, which suggests not, and maybe class e would be a better option for that kind of scenario
Sep 10 23:27:06 <tds>	but yeah, just use v6 already :)
Sep 10 23:27:16 <catphish>	Habbie: usually yes, but sometimes you want to do silly things that warrant more addresses
Sep 10 23:27:35 <Habbie>	catphish, some US ISPs have spent 1918 15 times over by now, yes
Sep 10 23:27:37 <catphish>	i once used all of 10.128.0.0/9 for a project
Sep 10 23:28:16 <catphish>	that pseudo-ipv4 thing is fun
Sep 10 23:35:25 <catphish>	i've spent too long trying to work out where track 1 is on a floppy disk
Sep 10 23:38:07 <catphish>	got it :)
Sep 11 01:07:33 <drac_boy>	hi
Sep 11 01:07:50 <fnaticrisk1>	Hello
Sep 11 01:07:56 <drac_boy>	how doing?
Sep 11 01:07:59 <Ruzzy>	yesterday I bought a cable tracer and tried putting the tone generator in the downstairs RJ45s and the upstairs ones too. Couldn't find the other end in both cases.
Sep 11 01:08:05 <Ruzzy>	I hate this place.
Sep 11 01:08:11 <fnaticrisk1>	Good and you?
Sep 11 01:11:32 <fnaticrisk1>	lol
Sep 11 01:11:55 <drac_boy>	doing ok beside still wishing for some nice network boxes but mm ah well
Sep 11 01:13:33 <fnaticrisk1>	That's good
Sep 11 01:13:37 <fnaticrisk1>	What is an network box?
Sep 11 01:19:36 <drac_boy>	fnaticrisk hmm .. something to plug several eth cables into? ;) heh
Sep 11 01:21:53 <fnaticrisk1>	Seems cool
Sep 11 01:23:14 <drac_boy>	did you forget which channel you're in now? :)

Sep 11 01:25:20 <drac_boy>	so what you doing tonight anyway logg?
Sep 11 01:27:15 <Logg>	fixing stuff that broke while i was on a 2 week trip. toilet stopped working, backdoor lock broke... I picked up a 386SX while i was on my trip, hope to repair it soon. battery acid ate the motherboard though
Sep 11 01:27:37 <drac_boy>	the house things doesn't sound like fun :-/
Sep 11 01:28:17 <Logg>	yeah lol. It can be OK though. I'm gonna put in a black toilet this time. the door lock is fixed now, needed a new bolt
Sep 11 01:30:39 <Logg>	in ##networking land, i recently got my ccna for the first time. and I was able to get some early 2000s ISP equipment configured as a dialup service, so I can use modems again
Sep 11 01:30:58 <Logg>	which is pretty neat. since some old computers can't be upgraded with ethernet
Sep 11 01:31:32 <b1tninja>	does RAS still exist in modern os
Sep 11 01:31:33 <drac_boy>	logg v90 and/or v92?
Sep 11 01:31:55 <b1tninja>	and will old modems work on newer digital telco
Sep 11 01:32:04 <b1tninja>	like will the compression/codecs be a problem
Sep 11 01:32:06 <b1tninja>	compared to POTS
Sep 11 01:32:23 <drac_boy>	b1tninja .. all that matters is its v34 minimum (more generally v90 minimum tho)
Sep 11 01:32:44 <drac_boy>	pre-28 doesn't exactly get much tech support anymore especially given the very low monthly profits any providers makes anymore
Sep 11 01:32:56 <MechKing>	Hello, I am looking for a good Network Diagram program.. Something I can draw pictures of the Cisco Meraki switch/ports and make it so we can put the mouse on top and see what that is feeding.. Etc.
Sep 11 01:33:07 <Logg>	it's v90, but it only manages to negotiate at 33kbps usually... idk if it's the phone network I'm using. Using a VIC 2FXS in a cisco 2610
Sep 11 01:33:10 <drac_boy>	mechking try dia
Sep 11 01:33:19 <ZedHeadTed|>	^
Sep 11 01:33:29 <drac_boy>	logg well 33 is still within reasons .. so yeah might be your script or just the physical phone line
Sep 11 01:33:56 <MechKing>	drac_boy Thank you, downloading it now.
Sep 11 01:34:50 <Logg>	drac_boy, yeah, I was happy to get it working at all, even though it's about half the speed it could be.
Sep 11 01:35:36 <drac_boy>	logg tbh funny that you mentioned it .. for a while I tried to find anything that would be a replacement to the 2600 series and couldn't find any so guess who still has to find these for brand new setups basically :-s
Sep 11 01:35:55 <Logg>	what function is missing in newer stuff?
Sep 11 01:36:20 <drac_boy>	being able to use modem especially for failover
Sep 11 01:47:10 <Logg>	VIC 2FXS & a WIC-1AM in a Cisco 2620 does it, if anyone else is interested in providing your own dial-up service... https://i.imgur.com/CzBGg3k.jpg

Sep 11 02:10:47 <Logg>	Twitch does it now
Sep 11 02:11:54 <Logg>	i remember some pretty lengthy discussion about supporting it in Streamlink

Sep 11 11:14:52 <[twisti]>	hey, is it still not possible to get a letsencrypt-cert for lan-only services ? we host stuff like gitlab on our intranet, which is not accessible from the outside, and we would like to enable https if only to silence all the warnings. we have domains we can use for this, but naturally we dont want to make our lan accessible from the outside
Sep 11 11:15:46 <Habbie>	praxis, depends on how one looks at it
Sep 11 11:15:55 <Habbie>	[twisti], the dns-01 challenge method is perfect for this
Sep 11 11:16:14 <[twisti]>	is there a readup somewhere about how to do this ? im not exactly a network expert
Sep 11 11:16:52 <Habbie>	[twisti], i don't know; i suggest checking for dns-01 support in your favourite letsencrypt client, and taking it from there
Sep 11 11:17:05 <[twisti]>	alright, thank you
Sep 11 11:17:47 <praxis>	Habbie: ..how does one look at it
Sep 11 11:18:23 <Habbie>	praxis, percentage of resolvers that validate; percentage of endusers behind validating resolvers; number of domains signed; number of TLDs with any serious deployment; EU-centric; US-centric
Sep 11 11:18:43 <Habbie>	combining any of those will easily swing the answer to 'is DNSSEC common' between 'yes' and 'no'
Sep 11 11:20:51 <TJ->	talking about DNSSEC, has anyone found that bind9/dnssec-signzone doesn't support CAA records?
Sep 11 11:22:58 <Habbie>	TJ-, sounds like an old version
Sep 11 11:23:19 <Habbie>	TJ-, in which case you can work around it using TYPE257 generic syntax
Sep 11 11:24:47 <praxis>	Habbie: i don't really get it. it seems excessive. it's to prevent dns walking, it seems? the domains the name server points to are stored as a hash instead of plain text?
Sep 11 11:25:28 <Habbie>	praxis, you seem to be mixing up a few things
Sep 11 11:25:53 <Habbie>	praxis, DNSSEC adds data authentication to the DNS; initially, it ALSO added zone walking to the DNS; this was 'fixed' by adding NSEC3 to DNSSEC
Sep 11 11:38:27 <praxis>	Habbie: NSEC3 is the thing i'm talking about i think
Sep 11 11:41:54 <TJ->	Habbie: thanks; I'd totally forgotten about that approach. BIND is fine with the CAA but dnssec-signzone hasn't been taught about CAA it seems
Sep 11 11:42:13 <praxis>	Habbie: i got some hashes from the dnsserver on my vm
Sep 11 11:42:15 <praxis>	> salt d399eaab
Sep 11 11:42:16 <praxis>	> iterations 1
Sep 11 11:42:16 <praxis>	> nexthash 94vpuqdr6rpr1ca3jc73nok6ghcdfi5f 94vuv8b92ur02irooa0ubtm7j5hgi5af
Sep 11 11:42:21 <Habbie>	TJ-, that's a weird discrepancy
Sep 11 11:42:36 <Habbie>	praxis, ah, nsec3walker collect
Sep 11 11:42:57 <praxis>	simimlar thing
Sep 11 11:43:21 <Habbie>	there's a different thing with output that looks similar?
Sep 11 11:44:02 <TJ->	Habbie: yes, same with NSEC3PARAM ... if the zone file already has one it breaks :)
Sep 11 11:44:24 <Habbie>	TJ-, weeeird
Sep 11 11:44:59 <TJ->	https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/issues/953
Sep 11 11:45:05 <TJ->	I hit that one last week
Sep 11 11:45:15 <praxis>	Habbie: nmap NSE script. it's basically the same thing. https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-nsec3-enum.html
Sep 11 11:45:28 <Habbie>	ah
Sep 11 11:45:36 <Habbie>	TJ-, ah, all the good people are in there :D
Sep 11 11:45:43 <Habbie>	praxis, ah!
Sep 11 11:46:13 <praxis>	i'm trying to crack a few of these hashes. there's six ir 8 in total i think
Sep 11 11:46:25 <Habbie>	6 or 8 what?
Sep 11 11:46:35 <praxis>	hashes
Sep 11 11:46:57 <Habbie>	of what?
Sep 11 11:47:05 <praxis>	i don't even know what they're hashes of exactly.
Sep 11 11:47:08 <praxis>	i dunno
Sep 11 11:47:12 <Habbie>	what are you even doing? :)
Sep 11 11:47:32 <praxis>	whatever they're hashes of, i thought you were gona tell me
Sep 11 11:47:39 <Habbie>	well
Sep 11 11:47:41 <Habbie>	what hashes do you mean?
Sep 11 11:47:45 <Habbie>	those two behind 'nexthash'?
Sep 11 11:47:57 <praxis>	like what i pasted just a minute ago
Sep 11 11:48:01 <praxis>	yeah
Sep 11 11:48:06 <praxis>	theres six more i think
Sep 11 11:48:07 <Habbie>	those are hashes of two domain names
Sep 11 11:48:09 <Habbie>	in .org if i have to guess
Sep 11 11:48:15 <Habbie>	there's way more than six more
Sep 11 11:48:30 <Habbie>	(if it's .org)
Sep 11 11:48:40 <praxis>	it's alheim.org
Sep 11 11:48:48 <praxis>	i guess they're subdomains
Sep 11 11:48:56 <Habbie>	alheim.org does not use NSEC3
Sep 11 11:49:19 <praxis>	apparently it does
Sep 11 11:49:22 <Habbie>	it does not
Sep 11 11:49:34 <Habbie>	and the salt in your paste is the one that .org uses
Sep 11 11:49:38 <Habbie>	now, another zone could use the same salt
Sep 11 11:49:48 <Habbie>	but it's all quite the coincidence
Sep 11 11:50:13 <praxis>	how are you so confident it doesn't
Sep 11 11:50:39 <Habbie>	dig nsec3param alheim.org  +dnssec
Sep 11 11:50:41 <Habbie>	is a good way to check
Sep 11 11:50:54 <Habbie>	it will either give you the nsec3param, or a proof that it does not exist
Sep 11 11:50:57 <Habbie>	and that proof will be nsec or nsec3
Sep 11 11:51:08 <Habbie>	also, it's hosted on cloudflare and cloudflare does not do nsec3
Sep 11 12:00:21 <praxis>	Habbie: it's hosted on my vm @ 10.0.0.8
Sep 11 12:00:47 <praxis>	i see what you mean though
Sep 11 12:00:47 <praxis>	this is how i got the hashes
Sep 11 12:00:52 <praxis>	nmap -sU -p 53 --script dns-nsec3-enum --script-args dns-nsec3-enum.domains=alheim.org 10.0.0.8
Sep 11 12:01:05 <praxis>	took a while
Sep 11 12:01:14 <praxis>	half hour or so
Sep 11 12:02:16 <Habbie>	i really wonder what it collected then :)
Sep 11 12:02:38 <Habbie>	oh, 10.0.0.8 hosts an nsec3 version of alheim.org?
Sep 11 12:07:22 <praxis>	Habbie: yeah, it seems to. it's weird i'm not even really sure what it is. it seems yo've heard the name before? or maybe you're just too quick
Sep 11 12:07:43 <Habbie>	praxis, i did not hear the name before, i just checked when you mentioned it
Sep 11 12:07:53 <Habbie>	praxis, but i'm still a bit confused on what you're trying to accomplish
Sep 11 12:07:56 <praxis>	you're right though, it wouldn't work if i referrred to the cloudflare dns server
Sep 11 12:08:04 <praxis>	but this worked
Sep 11 12:08:07 <praxis>	nmap -sU -p 53 --script dns-cache-snoop --script-args dns-cache-snoop.mode=nonrecursive, dns-cache-snoop.domains={alheim.org} sam.ns.cloudflare.com
Sep 11 12:08:45 <Habbie>	it really doesn't
Sep 11 12:08:50 <Habbie>	you should check what it found
Sep 11 12:09:58 <praxis>	i did.. what do you mean? the vm is supposedly pretty insecure. i'm just trying to poke holes in it
Sep 11 12:10:23 <Habbie>	that dns-cache-snoop nmap line does not make any sense
Sep 11 12:10:29 <Habbie>	and is unlikely to come up with anything interesting at all
Sep 11 12:15:17 <praxis>	Habbie: makes sense to me
Sep 11 12:15:25 <praxis>	nmap -sU -p 53 --script dns-cache-snoop.nse --script-args 'dns-cache-snoop.mode=nonrecursive,dns-cache-snoop.domains={alheim.org}' sam.ns.cloudflare.com
Sep 11 12:18:25 <praxis>	Habbie: i don't really see how it's useful information though. like, why go to the trouble of hashing the domains of a name server
Sep 11 12:20:29 <Habbie>	praxis, what makes sense to you? what did it generate?
Sep 11 12:22:12 <praxis>	Habbie:
Sep 11 12:22:15 <praxis>	53/udp open  domain
Sep 11 12:22:16 <praxis>	| dns-cache-snoop: 2 of 2 tested domains are cached.
Sep 11 12:22:16 <praxis>	| alheim.org
Sep 11 12:22:18 <praxis>	|_alheim-labs.alheim.org
Sep 11 12:24:21 <praxis>	or simply
Sep 11 12:24:22 <praxis>	nmap -sU -p 53 --script dns-cache-snoop.nse --script-args dns-cache-snoop.mode=nonrecursive sam.ns.cloudflare.com
Sep 11 12:24:24 <praxis>	will test a default list of domains. i'm not sure the significance of this information though
Sep 11 12:26:21 <jjakob>	on a switch with dhcp relay which vlan/interface do the relay packets originate from? the switches management interface addr or the vlan the dhcp is enabled on?
Sep 11 12:28:57 <Habbie>	praxis, it is useless information - it will report X of X for any number of domains it tests
Sep 11 12:29:09 <Habbie>	praxis, asking the auth server for a domain for 'what it has cached' does not make sense - it knows everything already
Sep 11 12:40:06 <praxis>	Habbie: so what's the purpose of the script
Sep 11 12:40:14 <unw0nt3d>	Hi! I'm trying to contact a server which has CORS enabled... but my client complains that cross origin resource reading has been blocked
Sep 11 12:40:34 <unw0nt3d>	the response was blocked by CORB... what am I doing wrong?
Sep 11 12:40:52 <Habbie>	praxis, finding out what records are currently present in a -cache-; where that presence indicates that somebody on the same network as you has looked up those names recently
Sep 11 12:45:16 <praxis>	Habbie: what about the nsec3 hashes
Sep 11 12:46:02 <Habbie>	praxis, what about them? there is no nsec3 in alheim.org
Sep 11 12:47:21 <praxis>	Habbie: we just went through this remember
Sep 11 12:47:56 <praxis>	it's local
Sep 11 12:51:05 <Habbie>	praxis, you vaguely hinted at that but never explained it
Sep 11 12:51:11 <Habbie>	praxis, and then you went right back to poking at sam.ns.cloudflare.co
Sep 11 12:51:39 <Habbie>	praxis, but, ok, so apparently you, like i asked a few times, do have a local 'instance' of alheim.org, and you have hashes from it?
Sep 11 13:00:50 <praxis>	Habbie: yeah, I said that a couple of times.i have 8 hashes in total, if you wana see
Sep 11 13:01:33 <Habbie>	sure, show them
Sep 11 13:02:32 <linux_probe>	ohhhhh dear..... https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-server-grade-cpus-impacted-by-new-netcat-attack/
Sep 11 13:02:39 <b1rk0ff>	will I keep having WiFi connectivity on a router+modem in Bridge mode ?
Sep 11 13:02:49 <linux_probe>	nope
Sep 11 13:02:51 <djph>	hopefully not
Sep 11 13:02:55 <Habbie>	b1rk0ff, if the -modem- is the one doing the wifi, usually not
Sep 11 13:03:40 <b1rk0ff>	do models where the router is doing the wifi even exists?
Sep 11 13:04:14 <djph>	b1rk0ff: 'models' of what?
Sep 11 13:04:24 <b1rk0ff>	of router+modem combo
Sep 11 13:04:57 <Habbie>	b1rk0ff, yes
Sep 11 13:05:13 <djph>	of course, practically all of them do these days
Sep 11 13:05:17 <djph>	drives me up a wall
Sep 11 13:05:22 <PlasmaHH>	Hi, for multicast membership report answers to a membership query, shouldn't all multicast addresses be reported in the same igmp answer packet?
Sep 11 13:07:44 <praxis>	Habbie: https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/2BVE0VKb
Sep 11 13:08:07 <Habbie>	for each pair, those are very close together
Sep 11 13:08:11 <Habbie>	suggesting that there are a lot of names in the zone
Sep 11 13:08:14 <Habbie>	or something else is happening
Sep 11 13:08:28 <Habbie>	and it using the salt from .org is still interesting
Sep 11 13:08:45 *	ChanServ gives voice to catphish
Sep 11 13:11:29 <praxis>	Habbie: any ideas or advice or anything
Sep 11 13:11:58 <Habbie>	praxis, i only know the original nsec3walker - maybe see what that finds
Sep 11 13:12:08 <Habbie>	praxis, i also suggest sending the actual queries yourself with dig +dnssec so you can see the nsec3 type bitmaps
Sep 11 13:12:27 <Habbie>	praxis, or tcpdump what either of the walkers do
Sep 11 13:12:46 <Habbie>	praxis, because most of what they get back, they just throw away, because it's not relevant to their jobs
Sep 11 13:13:44 <praxis>	what is this information hashed for
Sep 11 13:13:53 <praxis>	why is it sensitive
Sep 11 13:14:25 <Habbie>	some people consider the list of names in a zone sensitive
Sep 11 13:14:30 <Habbie>	i have not managed to ever understand this
Sep 11 13:14:45 <Habbie>	but in your case, i understand it might just be considered part of the challenge
Sep 11 13:23:42 <b1rk0ff>	if I connect my modem+router to my computer in Bridge mode would I need a DSL/RJ11 connection from my computer to the wall ?
Sep 11 13:26:11 <djph>	no, the DSL "router" is your modem
Sep 11 13:27:00 <b1rk0ff>	so the modem+router loses the routing capability
Sep 11 13:27:11 <b1rk0ff>	but what drives the PPP connection ?
Sep 11 13:27:43 <djph>	the modem
Sep 11 13:28:00 <djph>	"bridge mode" just says "stop being a router, and just be a modem"
Sep 11 13:31:56 <b1rk0ff>	but in my modem+router if I set it to bridge mode there is no setting for PPP credentials
Sep 11 13:33:17 <praxis>	i see
Sep 11 13:33:24 <djph>	yes, because it's JUST MODulating / DEModulating the xDSL signals for you.
Sep 11 13:33:43 <djph>	the immediate downstream device (e.g. a router) will then have to handle PPP login
Sep 11 13:38:39 <b1rk0ff>	modem will not present itself as serial port by just ethernet connection would it ?
Sep 11 13:39:23 <djph>	no, why would it masquerade as a serial port?
Sep 11 13:39:32 <djph>	what insanity are you doing here
Sep 11 13:39:35 <b1rk0ff>	then how will something communicatg with it ?
Sep 11 13:39:42 <Habbie>	djph, to be fair, you just said 'demodulating' :D
Sep 11 13:39:59 <b1rk0ff>	something needs to drive the modem to connect via PPTP
Sep 11 13:40:02 <b1rk0ff>	sorry PPP*
Sep 11 13:40:10 <djph>	well, on the ethernet side, it'll talk ethernet.  On the xDSL side, it'll talk xDSL
Sep 11 13:40:20 <grawity>	that 'something' is generally an external router
Sep 11 13:40:27 <grawity>	or a PC
Sep 11 13:40:32 <djph>	computer (router, whatever) will need to be told its connection is PPPoE
Sep 11 13:40:35 <grawity>	good old days of setting up PPPoE on Win98 PCs
Sep 11 13:40:42 <b1rk0ff>	an external router, which wil need to have RJ11 connection ?
Sep 11 13:40:44 <b1rk0ff>	to the wall?
Sep 11 13:40:47 <djph>	no
Sep 11 13:40:52 <grawity>	no, RJ45/Ethernet
Sep 11 13:41:13 <djph>	the MODEM/router all-in-one (in bridge mode) is your RJ11 -> RJ45 converter
Sep 11 13:41:15 <b1rk0ff>	like I said, my router+modem doesn't let me input PPP connection details on Bridge connection
Sep 11 13:41:15 <grawity>	wall <--RJ11/phoneline--> modem bridge <--RJ45/ethernet--> router PP client
Sep 11 13:41:25 <b1rk0ff>	so it must leave that to the other device
Sep 11 13:41:41 <b1rk0ff>	so PPP is driven via RJ45/ethernet?
Sep 11 13:41:42 <grawity>	yes, but the PPP details have nothing to do with the RJ11 connection itself!
Sep 11 13:42:03 <grawity>	when talking about ADSL, the PPP is almost always "PPPoE", so yes, it's driven via RJ45/ethernet
Sep 11 13:42:19 <b1rk0ff>	I would think 'ppp' softwware require tty/COM port to communicate with
Sep 11 13:42:22 <djph>	b1rk0ff: yes, the device immediately downstream from it (be it a router such as something from UBNT, or a PC set up to be a router, or ...) ...
Sep 11 13:42:33 <djph>	b1rk0ff: no, PPP doesn't need a serial port.
Sep 11 13:42:47 <b1rk0ff>	I see now.
Sep 11 13:43:32 <grawity>	PPP can run over anything that provides a data stream – it can go over serial, over TCP, over SSH, over Ethernet (PPPoE), over raw ATM/ADSL (PPPoA)
Sep 11 13:43:36 <djph>	at least the PPPoE / PPPoA / PPPo* variants that are used in modern xDSL circuits.
Sep 11 13:43:50 <grawity>	(and you accidentally mentioned PPTP earlier – that's PPP over GRE over IP)
Sep 11 13:44:04 <grawity>	er, no, I probably got that wrong
Sep 11 13:45:04 <b1rk0ff>	in my router+modem, I can set Bridge to be either ATM or PTM, does it matter?
Sep 11 13:45:15 <Habbie>	grawity, pptp? basically correct
Sep 11 13:45:17 <grawity>	what's "PTM"
Sep 11 13:45:24 <b1rk0ff>	it should be like the current, non-bridged, connection?
Sep 11 13:45:45 <grawity>	not quite sure what the setting means, but most likely yes
Sep 11 13:45:46 <b1rk0ff>	Packet Transfer Mode
Sep 11 13:45:54 <b1rk0ff>	as opposed to ATM
Sep 11 13:46:08 <grawity>	oh, maybe some VDSL stuff
Sep 11 13:46:11 <b1rk0ff>	or Pulse-Time Modulation
Sep 11 13:46:12 <grawity>	too modern for me to know
Sep 11 13:46:36 <b1rk0ff>	like UDP vs TCP
Sep 11 13:46:41 <grawity>	yeah, keep it as-is
Sep 11 13:53:02 <b1rk0ff>	generally, ATM/PTM refers to Encapsulation
Sep 11 14:03:14 <astronavt>	http keep-alive only applies to the specific url right? not the whole domain or something?
Sep 11 14:03:24 <Habbie>	keep-alive applies to a request
Sep 11 14:10:12 <Antares>	https://vk.com/cyberdepartment
Sep 11 14:12:43 <squ>	lol
Sep 11 14:28:03 <b1rk0ff>	Bridge seens to be working. Pppoe was very easy to set. It says Authentication succesful. But im not sure ny routing table is correct. Or dhcp is properly established
Sep 11 14:31:00 <b1rk0ff>	ppp0 iface is up but pppoe said it wont replace existing default route
Sep 11 14:31:13 <b1rk0ff>	Of local lan
Sep 11 14:31:33 <b1rk0ff>	Im not sure if or what is disturbing my wan
Sep 11 14:48:23 <Trifecta__>	man i just had a small heartattack, one of my colleagues reported a projection attempt to his laptop from one of our clients who is in the guest net, I was scrambling the logs for 10min until I remembered that miracast uses wi-fi direct aka ad-hoc wifi and his display/pc is freely available
Sep 11 14:49:10 <linux_probe>	lol
Sep 11 14:49:31 <linux_probe>	so, most of your machines are swiss cheese open
Sep 11 14:50:14 <Trifecta__>	well its just miracast but yeah kinda LUL
Sep 11 14:50:44 <linux_probe>	security by wide ope hole obscurity
Sep 11 14:57:38 <b1rk0ff>	What do i need to set after pppoe establishment.
Sep 11 15:08:15 <b1rk0ff>	Someone?
Sep 11 15:32:05 <freakynl>	b1rk0ff: you expect a crystalball on this end?
Sep 11 15:32:46 <mrbell1984>	you need to phone santa clause to ask him for a new pppoe establishment.
Sep 11 15:33:24 <freakynl>	But usually, assuming your PPPoE is for internet connectivity, yes, it should set your default gateway. If you don't have other internet lines the first q would be why there's already a default route on your system to begin with. But I know jack about your network, your system and why you're trying to achieve.
Sep 11 15:45:17 <yuradoc>	Hello. what's wrong with this filter: mitmdump -w ~/mitmdump.log -p 8090 --stickycookie ".test.com"
Sep 11 15:45:33 <yuradoc>	it's not filter requests by that domain

Sep 11 16:37:48 <b1rk0ff>	Freaklyn i talked about it earlier. Anyway i had to remove the default route from local router gateway to ppp 's
Sep 11 16:38:09 <b1rk0ff>	Remove and change
Sep 11 16:39:48 <b1rk0ff>	Wifi is causing me trouble now though
Sep 11 16:40:17 <b1rk0ff>	The router would send my device to a connection problem page.
Sep 11 16:40:42 <b1rk0ff>	Maybe i need to set dhcp for it on the new pc router?
Sep 11 16:42:02 <tatertots>	sounds like you got your hands full, new router, old router, new pc router, PPPoE .
Sep 11 16:42:18 <tatertots>	good luck with that

Sep 12 10:14:16 <mAniAk-_->	b1tninja: the protocols here have very real implementations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Comparison_to_other_networking_suites
Sep 12 10:25:58 <detha>	mAniAk-_-: when did you last see IPX or SNA in the wild?
Sep 12 10:26:52 <TandyUK>	dminuoso: vm version 8 and up (at least) have efi options
Sep 12 10:27:04 <b1tninja>	but the OSI model itself
Sep 12 10:27:07 <b1tninja>	doesn't exist
Sep 12 10:27:07 <TandyUK>	thats esxi 5.5 era vms
Sep 12 10:27:15 <b1tninja>	its just categories
Sep 12 10:27:33 <TandyUK>	detha: IPX for gaming many, many, many years ago
Sep 12 10:28:00 <TandyUK>	IPX/SPX via 2 nics connected with a bit of coax robbed from a tv lmao
Sep 12 10:28:31 <TandyUK>	worked for the original x-wing vs tie fighter :P
Sep 12 10:29:01 <TandyUK>	died out with win98 iirc
Sep 12 10:32:03 <detha>	TandyUK: yeah, around that time. SNA was slightly later, ~2001 I still built a gateway between an SCO-Unix box and an SNA-driven WAN
Sep 12 10:33:36 <mAniAk-_->	detha: ipx, not since win95 maybe at home? sna not at all
Sep 12 10:33:51 <mAniAk-_->	b1tninja: what?
Sep 12 10:36:25 <b1tninja>	are you a CCIE or something shit
Sep 12 10:36:47 <mAniAk-_->	cnlp and nsap addresses, not since i quit my job at an old isp, but they have since removed their sonet network so i don't think they have it anymore
Sep 12 10:37:02 <snappy>	aww :(
Sep 12 10:37:53 <mAniAk-_->	is-is so still some nsap left
Sep 12 10:38:43 <mAniAk-_->	b1tninja: nope, but you'll find some weird shit at old carriers/isp's
Sep 12 10:41:42 <dminuoso>	TandyUK: Mmm its just not even listed.

Sep 12 12:10:16 <Assid>	heya
Sep 12 12:12:57 <skyroveRR>	Howdy
Sep 12 12:16:37 <Assid>	so im considering picking up 2 X HP 2910al -J9147A on sale.. and would like to connectg them over 10gbe cat5
Sep 12 12:16:40 <Assid>	err cat6
Sep 12 12:17:53 <Assid>	im not exactly sure which SFP+ connector i need for this
Sep 12 12:18:09 <Assid>	if its possible to do it
Sep 12 12:20:30 <Phil-Work`>	Assid: https://www.fs.com/uk/products/66617.html
Sep 12 12:20:50 <Phil-Work`>	select HP as compatible brand
Sep 12 12:21:08 <Phil-Work`>	it's a lot cheaper to do it on fibre, if you're not restricted to copper
Sep 12 12:22:08 <Assid>	i dont know anything about fibre to be honest
Sep 12 12:23:07 <Assid>	fibre is cheaper ?!?! how ? since when ?
Sep 12 12:23:47 <Phil-Work`>	Assid: https://www.fs.com/uk/products/50004.html
Sep 12 12:24:10 <Phil-Work`>	Assid: https://www.fs.com/uk/products/40191.html
Sep 12 12:24:24 <Assid>	but i dont know hwo to splice.. and whatever it
Sep 12 12:24:45 <Phil-Work`>	those are pre-terminated cables, you don't need to splice them
Sep 12 12:25:18 <Assid>	i think i need 50m or so
Sep 12 12:26:02 <Phil-Work`>	you'll struggle to get 10G that far on copper
Sep 12 12:26:39 <Phil-Work`>	you'll want these: https://www.fs.com/uk/products/87603.html
Sep 12 12:26:46 <Phil-Work`>	plus cat6a, if you insist on using copper
Sep 12 12:27:08 <Phil-Work`>	but fibre will futureproof you - you can run 100G and beyond on the same SM fibre
Sep 12 12:30:04 <Assid>	so i need LC-LC cable
Sep 12 12:34:05 <Assid>	Phil-Work: thanks for the info.. will check with the fitout person if they have someone who can do it on site.. else im sure where you buy the cable they probably have something ready made.. , will look into  the SFP modules meanwhile..
Sep 12 12:34:46 <Phil-Work>	Assid: yes, LC to LC for SFP+
Sep 12 12:34:59 <Assid>	cool.. looki learned something !
Sep 12 12:35:21 <Assid>	https://www.amazon.ae/AmazonBasics-Multimode-Duplex-Fiber-Patch/dp/B07FDHY1H7/ref=asc_df_B07FDMCDJR/?tag=googleshopp09-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=381903964987&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5416807634334009816&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1000013&hvtargid=pla-965574546152&th=1
Sep 12 12:35:38 <Phil-Work>	that's multimode
Sep 12 12:35:38 <Assid>	i see this as well, but no 50m
Sep 12 12:36:07 <Phil-Work>	it'll work, but you need multimode transceivers, but the extra cost for singlemode is not a lot and "friends don't let friends by multimode"
Sep 12 12:37:12 <Assid>	wait what?  what should i look for if i dont want to look for multimode
Sep 12 12:38:51 <Assid>	ok i need OS2
Sep 12 12:39:06 <Assid>	do all SFP+ switches work with the same cable ?
Sep 12 12:40:08 <Phil-Work>	the cable is dependant on the transceiver you put in the SFP+ slot
Sep 12 12:40:17 <Phil-Work>	not SFP+ itself
Sep 12 12:45:02 <Assid>	ok so this https://www.fs.com/uk/products/50004.html should work with all HP switches  with SFP+  ?
Sep 12 12:45:51 <Phil-Work>	select HP from the compatibility box and put your switch model number in
Sep 12 12:45:57 <azonenberg>	Phil-Work: I prefer MM for in-building wiring not just because it's cheaper, but because the tolerances are looser
Sep 12 12:46:04 <azonenberg>	9 vs 50um core means a lot less dust can cause problems
Sep 12 12:46:16 <azonenberg>	and a lot less jiggle drops the link
Sep 12 12:46:36 <Phil-Work>	azonenberg, sure though it tends to futureproof you less
Sep 12 12:47:02 <Phil-Work>	the same SM fibre that you ran 1G on can now run 400G and probably 1T in the future, if you're lucky
Sep 12 12:49:04 <azonenberg>	True, but the OM4 i'm using for 1/10G now is good out to 400Gbase-SR4.2 as well
Sep 12 12:49:28 <Phil-Work>	sure
Sep 12 12:49:35 <azonenberg>	i'm a loooong ways from needing that
Sep 12 12:49:48 <azonenberg>	and when i do, it will likely be a handful of pipes
Sep 12 12:50:02 <azonenberg>	and with the fiber in conduit and tray, replacing the OM4 with OM7 when the time comes won't be too hard or pricey
Sep 12 12:50:20 <azonenberg>	If it's on the bottom of the ocean or something it's a whole different ball game
Sep 12 12:50:41 <azonenberg>	but you wouldn't run MM for that anyway
Sep 12 12:57:14 <TJ->	Does anyone know of an RFC3597 DNS unknown RR generic generator where it is possible to give it the textual RR and it'll spit out the classXXX/typeXXX equivalent for known types?
Sep 12 12:57:51 <TJ->	there are several for CAA type257 but I was looking for one to easily handle type51 (NSEC3PARAM)
Sep 12 13:07:30 <Peng_>	TJ-: If it's a live record, you can use dig +unknownformat
Sep 12 13:07:37 <Peng_>	also why :D
Sep 12 13:34:44 <c0mrade>	so would ips like as an example 1.1.1.0/17 already exist in 1.1.1.0/22
Sep 12 13:45:41 <Assid>	Phil-Work: could you help me check on amazon.com / amazon.ae for the same type of sfp+
Sep 12 13:50:56 <djph>	c0mrade: no, but 1.1.1.0/22 is part of 1.1.1.0/17
Sep 12 13:52:18 <Assid>	c0mrade: the smaller network will be part of the bigger network
Sep 12 13:57:11 <TJ->	Peng_: the problem is creating the record in the first place... the reason = BIND9's dnssign-zone cannot handle an existing NSEC3PARAM RR in the zone file (known bug), so I was hoping to avoid the issue (as can be done with CAA/type257)
Sep 12 13:57:54 <Syzolin>	TJ- are you trying to create a BlackList Server ?
Sep 12 13:58:53 <TJ->	Syzolin: no, just have an NSEC3PARAM record that doesn't break automatic re-signing with bind
Sep 12 13:59:40 <TJ->	bug: https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/issues/953
Sep 12 14:01:19 <Syzolin>	TJ- maybe I can help you.
Sep 12 14:01:23 <Syzolin>	What’s the issue.
Sep 12 14:02:35 <TJ->	Syzolin: I'd just like zone resigning not to fail due to finding the NSEC3PARAM RR
Sep 12 14:02:55 <Syzolin>	oh that’s easy
Sep 12 14:13:35 <crockwork>	TCPdump is still the best way to see stuff over the network, right?
Sep 12 14:18:01 <skyroveRR>	crockwork: there's an improved version for those GUI fans, called wireshark.
Sep 12 14:18:18 <ne2k>	crockwork, you may prefer tshark or wireshark, depending on your requirements, but they're basically the same
Sep 12 14:31:33 <praxis>	hey is SFTP just ftp used in conjunction with ssh? or is it a whoe separate ervice
Sep 12 14:33:19 <galtj>	i think it uses scp
Sep 12 14:34:23 <galtj>	no
Sep 12 14:34:24 <galtj>	ssh
Sep 12 14:34:58 <snappy>	it doesnt use scp, it's separate from ssh, it's its own thing
Sep 12 14:35:06 <snappy>	and it's not ftp.
Sep 12 14:35:23 <snappy>	both regular ftp and ftps is an abomination that needs to die
Sep 12 14:37:07 <djph>	praxis: it's a separate service.  It just happens to use a similar acronym.
Sep 12 14:42:45 <Sout>	snappy, interestingly enough, the use of scp is disfavoured (by openssh) and sftp or rsync is recommended. https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html
Sep 12 14:43:20 <snappy>	yeah i think after the recent scp exploit where a server can execute commands on the client (or maybe it was the opposite), i think scp has since been discouraged
Sep 12 14:43:34 <snappy>	also sftp-server in openssh can be chrooted pretty easily.
Sep 12 15:00:44 <praxis>	snappy: recent scp exploit?
Sep 12 15:01:52 <snappy>	see: https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html
Sep 12 15:02:10 <praxis>	i wa thinking about this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45001
Sep 12 15:03:03 <praxis>	snappy: i guess you're thinking about this one https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46193
Sep 12 15:03:54 <snappy>	yeah essentially that, basically the server can pick a file and write to it due to some wildcard hax
Sep 12 15:04:06 <praxis>	would be super awkward to exploit, you have to get them to download from you
Sep 12 15:04:12 <snappy>	no bueno if scp with wildcard as root
Sep 12 16:06:52 <rumbler31>	hey all.  Trying to find some sanity.  My network security guy is adamant that we change the ips of a completely private network due to STIG https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/perimeter_router/2015-12-18/finding/V-14692
Sep 12 16:07:16 <rumbler31>	the product had a few networks divided by routers, and obviously they are all on private ip ranges
Sep 12 16:07:41 <TeixeiraRafael>	Hey, anyone has any experience with USB over Ethernet applications?
Sep 12 16:07:58 <TeixeiraRafael>	I need to implement a solution but I have no idea where to start
Sep 12 16:08:03 <rumbler31>	he thinks that because any router is a "perimeter device" that it must be given the "perimeter device STIG checklist" to complete, and wants to change the scheme to an address that is publicly routable
Sep 12 16:08:12 <Habbie>	rumbler31, he's mad
Sep 12 16:08:19 <rumbler31>	thats what I SAID!!!!!!
Sep 12 16:08:20 <Habbie>	rumbler31, in your case, the traffic you're allowing through is *not spoofed*
Sep 12 16:08:26 <rumbler31>	YESSSSS
Sep 12 16:08:36 <Habbie>	rumbler31, you seem super happy to hear that you're not mad ;)
Sep 12 16:08:36 <rumbler31>	I'm trying to find any public guidance on this
Sep 12 16:08:41 <rumbler31>	YESSSSSSSS!!!!!
Sep 12 16:08:49 <Habbie>	'public guidance' is 'prevent all spoofing'
Sep 12 16:08:58 <Habbie>	but this stig checklist item is 'never allow 1918 space through routers'
Sep 12 16:09:04 <Habbie>	which is a fine checklist item for a lot of networks
Sep 12 16:09:10 <Habbie>	as a more specific variant of 'just no spoofing'
Sep 12 16:13:13 <azonenberg>	Habbie: there's a difference between an internet-facing border router
Sep 12 16:13:20 <azonenberg>	and internal routers on a large network
Sep 12 16:13:41 <azonenberg>	If your security guy can't understand that, you need a new security guy
Sep 12 16:13:57 <rumbler31>	I tried to explain it.
Sep 12 16:13:57 <Habbie>	rumbler31, ^ what azonenberg said was for you and obviously i agree
Sep 12 16:14:24 <rumbler31>	next up in the issue train, is that the guy who is in charge of the routers to change, also thinks that the downstream networks need to change, even though NAT is implemeneted
Sep 12 16:14:49 <rumbler31>	so the "wan" side would change, which I don't care about, but that other guy thinks that the individual lan sides need to change too
Sep 12 16:15:52 <rumbler31>	my "I'm going to get fired response" was about to be "how do you think your home internet works...."
Sep 12 16:17:20 <rumbler31>	but I am going to draft a very large letter outlining all this craziness
Sep 12 16:30:32 <tatertots>	just curious...smells like a non profit environment/organization..am i right?
Sep 12 16:31:51 <Assid>	every non profit is funded by some for profit organization, someway or another
Sep 12 16:57:59 <TJ->	Anyone else noticed that bind9 DNSSEC NSEC3PARAM RRs contain the salt length but RFC5155 s4.3 says it should not?
Sep 12 16:58:15 <Habbie>	TJ-, that seems very unlikely
Sep 12 16:58:17 <Habbie>	TJ-, can you show that?
Sep 12 16:59:10 <Habbie>	TJ-, or, to respond to 'anyone else noticed', it's the kind of thing i would have noticed ;)
Sep 12 17:00:11 <TJ->	Habbie: hmmm, it may be due to encoding... values surrounded with ( ... ) do they denote raw bytes inside ? dnssec-signzone generated: "example.com IN NSEC3PARAM ( 1 0 10 16 0123456789abcdef ) "
Sep 12 17:00:33 <Habbie>	no, () just means newlines are ignored
Sep 12 17:01:09 <Habbie>	so this is surprising
Sep 12 17:01:12 <Habbie>	what version?
Sep 12 17:01:34 <Habbie>	also, your salt is 8 octets long, not 16
Sep 12 17:01:41 <Habbie>	i almost wonder if your salt is not '160123.....'
Sep 12 17:01:58 <Habbie>	but then the output would still be weird
Sep 12 17:03:37 <TJ->	right, but the length field is the number of textual characters not the RDATA field length
Sep 12 17:03:52 <TJ->	that's the same as an unknown RR record, e.g. if it were a type51 \# ... I think
Sep 12 17:04:27 <TJ->	bind9.11.3 on Ubuntu 18.04
Sep 12 17:05:26 <Habbie>	9.11.5 on debian buster: NSEC3PARAM 1 0 10 0123456789ABCDEF
Sep 12 17:07:06 <ThePendulum>	so I have a wireguard client config for the company I work for that's up and running and I can reach their sites
Sep 12 17:07:11 <Habbie>	9.11.3 on 18.04: NSEC3PARAM 1 0 10 0123456789ABCDEF
Sep 12 17:07:19 <ThePendulum>	however when I run tcpdump on that interface, a lot won't show up
Sep 12 17:07:21 <Habbie>	TJ-, i cannot easily reproduce your issue; but if it's real, it's a bug that should be fixed
Sep 12 17:07:26 <Habbie>	TJ-, want to pop into #bind for this?
Sep 12 17:07:37 <ThePendulum>	in fact, almost everything does show up even if it's unreachable, except for repo.local.company.net
Sep 12 17:07:52 <ThePendulum>	which is reachable perfectly fine
Sep 12 17:08:11 <ThePendulum>	wondering what I could be overlooking. when I run the same command on my other vpn's interface, I appear to see everything
Sep 12 17:08:21 <ThePendulum>	doesn't appear to be caching from the browser
Sep 12 17:08:39 <TJ->	Habbie: ha, it's OK finally figured it out. Bug in webmin's bind8-lib -- the Perl is writing out the length ... hadn't realise that for this particular zone it had been used to initially add the record
Sep 12 17:09:01 <Habbie>	TJ-, ah!
Sep 12 17:09:05 <Habbie>	TJ-, ok, very good :)
Sep 12 17:09:23 <ThePendulum>	one thing that does stand out to me on my normal vpn. when I ping google, it only shows up once? shouldn't it be a continuous stream?
Sep 12 17:10:29 <Habbie>	ThePendulum, what exactly shows up once?
Sep 12 17:10:30 <tatertots>	maybe someone doesn't think letting you ping "continuous" is a smart idea....
Sep 12 17:10:41 <TJ->	Habbie: to save me some hours of research do you happen to know if bind8 *did* write the length, or is this just a long-standing bug in webmin module that no-one else has ever hit! ?
Sep 12 17:11:26 <tatertots>	and maybe that person is "privledged" on that side of the network, compared to you having zero privledge on that side of the network
Sep 12 17:11:40 <rumbler31>	ok  sent the big email.  Lets see if I get fired
Sep 12 17:11:42 <tatertots>	....one ping is enough for you
Sep 12 17:11:44 <tatertots>	lol
Sep 12 17:11:44 <Habbie>	TJ-, i'm pretty sure bind8 never supported NSEC3
Sep 12 17:12:44 <TJ->	Habbie: hehehe why is it me that always finds the edge-cases!? this has been getting at me for over a week but I had erroneously assumed the NSEC3PARAM RR came from the initial call to dnssec-signzone !
Sep 12 17:12:52 <Habbie>	:)
Sep 12 17:13:01 <TJ->	Habbie: no wonder dnsssec-signzone barfed and refused to resign zones with it present
Sep 12 17:13:05 <Habbie>	TJ-, can you 'dig nsec3param' against such a 'broken' instance?
Sep 12 17:13:06 <Habbie>	TJ-, oh :)
Sep 12 17:13:09 <Habbie>	TJ-, well that answers my dig question
Sep 12 17:13:45 <TJ->	Habbie: no I cannot... the zone is broken with the RR in place, I'd left this one with a leading comment ; to disable it but keep it around so I could figure it out :)
Sep 12 17:13:57 <ThePendulum>	Habbie: I think that's all for the ping https://www.pastery.net/vdvczw/
Sep 12 17:14:02 <Habbie>	TJ-, yes, the refusal answers any question i had about dig :)
Sep 12 17:14:08 <TJ->	Habbie: I'd reported it as https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bind9/+bug/1842939
Sep 12 17:14:10 <Habbie>	ThePendulum, that's just the DNS lookup
Sep 12 17:14:11 <ThePendulum>	but for every next ping, even when I start over, I stop seeing that
Sep 12 17:14:15 <Habbie>	ThePendulum, that is needed so that ping can then ping the IP
Sep 12 17:14:16 <ThePendulum>	yes
Sep 12 17:14:26 <Habbie>	ThePendulum, ping does not do a DNS lookup every second
Sep 12 17:14:27 <ThePendulum>	and it caches this somewhere?
Sep 12 17:14:33 <ThePendulum>	between individual ping commands
Sep 12 17:14:37 <Habbie>	TJ-, 'extra input text' oh yes
Sep 12 17:15:06 <Habbie>	TJ-, so that was not the same as the upstream bug https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/issues/953
Sep 12 17:15:12 <Habbie>	ThePendulum, yes
Sep 12 17:16:12 <TJ->	Habbie: I can see that now... but ... well you know what its like when not a 'domain' (as in topic) expert
Sep 12 17:16:18 <Habbie>	TJ-, oh yes
Sep 12 17:16:23 <Habbie>	TJ-, just pointing that out now for clarity
Sep 12 17:16:44 <TJ->	Habbie: I'm updating the bug and now to issue a PR for webmin/bind8 module to fix it
Sep 12 17:17:40 <ThePendulum>	Habbie: any way to see or clear this so I can see whether my request is using the proper DNS server?
Sep 12 17:24:05 <Habbie>	TJ-, cool
Sep 12 17:24:19 <Habbie>	ThePendulum, depends on where it is cached - could be dnsmasq or systemd-resolved on your machine

Sep 12 17:25:44 <catphish>	morning humans
Sep 12 17:26:12 <ThePendulum>	more of a midnight human myself
Sep 12 17:26:48 <ThePendulum>	Habbie: interesting how no other address seems to have this issue, heh
Sep 12 17:28:17 <ThePendulum>	dig seems to provide a bit more insight than nslookup and tcpdump
Sep 12 17:57:04 <TuxBlackEdo>	has anyone messed with a "PowerEdge C5220" server? I am trying to set up the BMC and I was wondering how one would go about setting up the main chassis bmc port?
Sep 12 17:57:50 <TuxBlackEdo>	does the main chassis BMC port act as a switch for each server? so each server has a dedicated ip?
Sep 12 17:58:37 <TuxBlackEdo>	according to dell's website: Server management Embedded BMC with IPMI 2.0 support with 1 x 1GbE RJ45 connector on the chassis (dedicated) or the 1 x 1GbE port (shared) on the individual sled
Sep 12 17:59:15 <TuxBlackEdo>	"Each server can be configured to use the dedicated port. That port has a network-like switch in the
Sep 12 17:59:58 <TuxBlackEdo>	does that mean that once I get a server's BMC ip set up, then I can access all the servers on their respective ip through the chassis BMC port?
Sep 12 18:01:06 <azonenberg_work>	Wooo my UPS is out for delivery... Round two this time
Sep 12 18:01:30 <azonenberg_work>	Last time, between the dealer and fedex, they managed to not ship the 240-120V conversion module at all (or if they did ship it, they lost it)
Sep 12 18:01:51 <azonenberg_work>	And the UPS itself got dropped so bad the front panel was dangling by a cable and all kinds of stuff was smashed
Sep 12 18:02:54 <azonenberg_work>	This time it shipped fedex freight and not as a normal fedex package, and is on a pallet
Sep 12 18:03:14 <azonenberg_work>	Judging by the weight on the manifest, i'm getting the entire system this time
Sep 12 18:03:22 <azonenberg_work>	So all they have to do is not smash it before it gets to me
Sep 12 18:03:43 <azonenberg_work>	Wonder what the odds of that are :p
Sep 12 18:04:05 <TuxBlackEdo>	have fun replacing batteries
Sep 12 18:04:27 <Sout>	well it is on a pallet, so hopefully not regular joe blow can move it. thus requiring a truck with a forklift :D
Sep 12 18:04:28 <azonenberg_work>	TuxBlackEdo: Lol. I RMA'd the smashed one
Sep 12 18:04:45 <azonenberg_work>	Yes exactly, that's my hope
Sep 12 18:05:22 <azonenberg_work>	Its 285 pounds, i dont think some he-man wannabe is going to be slinging it over his shoulder and dropping it on one corner
Sep 12 18:05:22 <azonenberg_work>	The last time, the UPS was on its side blocking the delivery entrance to my lab
Sep 12 18:05:32 <azonenberg_work>	with the "this side up" arrow pointing towards the building
Sep 12 18:05:39 <azonenberg_work>	and one corner dented in about 3 inches
Sep 12 18:06:18 <azonenberg_work>	I had to go out the main door, drag it away from the delivery door, then haul it inside
Sep 12 18:06:34 <azonenberg_work>	only after i had power off to the whole rack did i realize it was a) smashed and b) incomplete
Sep 12 18:06:47 <azonenberg_work>	So yeah, not happy
Sep 12 18:07:04 <azonenberg_work>	I've had good experiences with freight shipments being treated with more respect though
Sep 12 18:08:02 <azonenberg_work>	TuxBlackEdo: Re battery replacement, my plan is to do a phased deployment of things in order to avoid having to do a whole bunch at once
Sep 12 18:08:17 <azonenberg_work>	Roll out the UPS now, then add one EBM every month or two until i'm at the target run time
Sep 12 18:08:28 <azonenberg_work>	(this is a new build-out so being fully online at day one isn't a must)
Sep 12 18:08:56 <azonenberg_work>	that way when i replace them i can do so on a staged schedule too, and not have to deal with a pallet piled high with 18U of batteries
Sep 12 18:09:38 <TuxBlackEdo>	battery technology is so bad, you are going to wish you never bought a UPS
Sep 12 18:10:39 <azonenberg_work>	Given the number of power outages i've had in the past, i think not
Sep 12 18:10:59 <azonenberg_work>	i've been quite happy with my double conversion cyberpower, my only complaint is that it was too small
Sep 12 18:11:13 <azonenberg_work>	Still working fine after four or five years without a battery change with acceptable run time, which i was quite impressed at
Sep 12 18:11:42 <azonenberg_work>	I'm scaling up from a 1.5 kVA 2U cyberpower to a 6 kVA 3U eaton with something like four 3U EBMs
Sep 12 18:12:51 <tatertots>	nice
Sep 12 18:13:40 <TuxBlackEdo>	does anyone know how to set up a PowerEdge C5220 _CHASSIS_ (not individual server) BMC/IPMI port? I am lost
Sep 12 18:13:58 <TuxBlackEdo>	by set up i mean set IPs

Sep 12 18:54:25 <Thuryn>	yo
Sep 12 18:56:21 <giaco>	I'm looking for a IoT messaging solutions. IoT devices are natted and I need to communicate with them. Server should receive sensor data and device should receive configuration commands.
Sep 12 18:56:50 <Habbie>	giaco, MQTT is a very common answer to that question
Sep 12 18:57:28 <giaco>	Habbie: I was looking at it, but I've stopped at the security part. How can I authenticate the device?
Sep 12 18:58:34 <Habbie>	giaco, user/pass (over TLS, of course) or TLS client certificates
Sep 12 19:01:55 <giaco>	Habbie: which MQTT broker would you study first? RabbitMQ?
Sep 12 19:02:08 <Habbie>	giaco, i've only ever used mosquitto
Sep 12 19:02:13 <Habbie>	giaco, so i have no advice
Sep 12 19:02:22 <Habbie>	giaco, #mqtt is full of friendly people, btw
Sep 12 19:03:11 <giaco>	Habbie: thanks
Sep 12 19:16:49 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	i need assistance creating a static route in linux
Sep 12 19:17:40 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	i am on the 1.1.1.1/24 subnet and i need to add a static route to the 2.2.2.2 subnet
Sep 12 19:18:39 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	Do I use: ip route add 2.2.2.0/24 via 1.1.1.1 dev eth0?
Sep 12 19:20:38 <jadax>	what is 'Host key verification failed' problem related to? This is ssh
Sep 12 19:22:24 <Aeso>	lll3N1GmAlll__, looks about right to me.
Sep 12 19:22:36 <Aeso>	Though wouldn't it have been easier to just try it than ask here? :P
Sep 12 19:22:43 <obcecado>	jadax: the server fingerpring has changed
Sep 12 19:23:00 <jadax>	what are my options then?
Sep 12 19:23:03 <obcecado>	either due to reinstall or $badactors
Sep 12 19:23:04 <jadax>	it's my dev server
Sep 12 19:23:17 <jadax>	anything that's changed is because I did it
Sep 12 19:23:25 <jadax>	no man in the middle
Sep 12 19:23:28 <Aeso>	lll3N1GmAlll__, oh, note that that won't survive a reboot. You'll have to add it to a config file somewhere for that.
Sep 12 19:24:19 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	thanks Aeso; but it didnt work. i did try that. this is why im confused
Sep 12 19:24:36 <pigeon123>	Is it safe to convert a GUID to 32 bit, for use as salt?
Sep 12 19:24:59 <pigeon123>	xor xor xor
Sep 12 19:26:36 <Habbie>	pigeon123, a GUID doesn't fit in 32 bit; but what problem are you solving?
Sep 12 19:27:07 <pigeon123>	The salt field for the encryption key is 32 bit.
Sep 12 19:27:33 <Habbie>	ok
Sep 12 19:27:39 <Habbie>	but why is there a GUID in this story?
Sep 12 19:27:57 <Habbie>	also, encryption or hashing?
Sep 12 19:27:57 <pigeon123>	I want cross platform code. GUID is the easy way.
Sep 12 19:28:03 <Habbie>	what language?
Sep 12 19:28:32 <pigeon123>	I could get 32 bits from /dev/urandom but I want it to work on Windows. Pascal
Sep 12 19:28:55 <Habbie>	the problem with GUID/UUID is that, depending on implementation, not all of the bits may be random, or in fact, sometimes none of the bits are random
Sep 12 19:33:47 <tatertots>	lll3N1GmAlll__: what error did you get?
Sep 12 19:33:58 <tatertots>	lll3N1GmAlll__: did you make a typo?
Sep 12 19:36:09 <azonenberg_work>	Habbie: You can easily tell, though
Sep 12 19:36:21 <azonenberg_work>	The first nibble in the third group of the GUID
Sep 12 19:36:31 <azonenberg_work>	If it's a 1, then it's a time/mac addr based one
Sep 12 19:36:35 <azonenberg_work>	if it's a 4, it's a PRNG based one
Sep 12 19:36:43 <azonenberg_work>	if anything else, you probably do not have a real uuid
Sep 12 19:37:44 <BitShack>	decided to make a script kidde thing for my own website
Sep 12 19:37:47 <BitShack>	https://bounce-ball-xploit.luacoder-dev.repl.run/
Sep 12 19:37:52 <BitShack>	mess with it if you want
Sep 12 19:39:49 <Habbie>	azonenberg_work, ack, i know :)
Sep 12 19:40:02 <Habbie>	azonenberg_work, but that sounds like more work than various other good options for pigeon123
Sep 12 19:40:07 <azonenberg_work>	Yes
Sep 12 19:40:21 <azonenberg_work>	realistically, on windows use cryptgenrandom
Sep 12 19:40:37 <azonenberg_work>	or whatever the new apis are - that was the go-to last time i did windows dev work ten years ago
Sep 12 19:40:41 <azonenberg_work>	there may be new stuff now :p
Sep 12 19:41:19 <Habbie>	:)
Sep 12 19:41:26 <Habbie>	i'm a bit surprised 'Pascal' doesn't have a portable function for it
Sep 12 19:41:47 <pigeon123>	C doesn't
Sep 12 19:42:14 <Habbie>	that's true, random() and friends are in POSIX, not in C
Sep 12 19:42:47 <Habbie>	but, i'm still surprised
Sep 12 19:42:51 <Habbie>	because in practice, C does
Sep 12 19:42:56 <Habbie>	even if it's not guaranteed
Sep 12 19:43:22 <Habbie>	actually i disagree
Sep 12 19:43:27 <Habbie>	even my K&R C book mentions rand()
Sep 12 19:43:29 <Habbie>	now, rand is bad
Sep 12 19:43:31 <Habbie>	but it's there
Sep 12 19:43:48 <pigeon123>	Ha ha. Pascal also has that
Sep 12 19:43:55 <Habbie>	ah :)
Sep 12 19:43:58 <Habbie>	but it's also bad i bet
Sep 12 19:44:01 <pigeon123>	Same result
Sep 12 19:44:09 <Habbie>	so, that salt you need
Sep 12 19:44:14 <Habbie>	does it need to be unpredictable, or just unique?
Sep 12 19:44:26 <pigeon123>	Unique
Sep 12 19:44:27 <kepler>	pascals are too muted for me, prefer more solid colors
Sep 12 19:45:06 <Habbie>	pigeon123, ok - then full GUIDs would be fine even if they are non-random on a certain system, but that doesn't help your 32 bit situation
Sep 12 19:45:30 <pigeon123>	It's fine I just xor all four 32 bit
Sep 12 19:46:05 <Habbie>	right
Sep 12 19:46:25 <Habbie>	so uhm
Sep 12 19:46:25 <Guest51>	If my ISP is providing 300Mbps down and my desktop has a fast ethernet (100 Mbps) card, will I be able to get speeds over 100 Mbps?
Sep 12 19:46:30 <Habbie>	pascal does have a portable function to make GUIDs?
Sep 12 19:46:33 <Habbie>	Guest51, no
Sep 12 19:46:41 <pigeon123>	CreateGUID
Sep 12 19:46:53 <Habbie>	The default mechanism for creating a new GUID is system dependent. If operating system support is available, it is used. If none is available, a default implementation using random numbers is used.
Sep 12 19:46:55 <Habbie>	right
Sep 12 19:47:04 <Habbie>	so what i mentioned above about the quality perhaps being very different between OSes
Sep 12 19:47:16 <Habbie>	but, i strongly suspect it's high quality on most modern OSes
Sep 12 19:47:29 <Habbie>	( that's from https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/sysutils/createguid.html )
Sep 12 19:58:54 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	tatertots, i get no error. it just doesnt route properly. when i traceroute 2.2.2.2 i see it hit the default gateway on 1.1.1.1 and then goes nowhere
Sep 12 19:59:15 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	1 hop and then nothing
Sep 12 20:00:30 <Thuryn>	lll3N1GmAlll__, the route back to you doesn't exist.
Sep 12 20:01:13 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	what do i add for that?
Sep 12 20:01:34 <Aeso>	I mean is it possible 2.2.2.2 isn't configured to respond to ICMP?
Sep 12 20:01:50 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	it is configured to allow icmp
Sep 12 20:02:25 *	ChanServ gives voice to catphish
Sep 12 20:03:33 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	Thuryn, would the additional route need to be: ip route add 1.1.1.0/24 via 2.2.2.2 dev eth0?
Sep 12 20:04:24 <Aeso>	if one doesn't exist on 1.1.1.1, sure. But 1.1.1.1 should already have direct routes for both, given that it has IPs on both subnets.
Sep 12 20:05:26 <praxis>	can i set up a vm so that it can be reached from the internet
Sep 12 20:05:31 <Thuryn>	Aeso, it's the next hop router that doesn't know how to find 1.1.1.0
Sep 12 20:06:30 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	that router is supposed have an ACL to allow traffic from 1.1.1.0/24 to 2.2.2.0/24
Sep 12 20:06:44 <Thuryn>	is this a NAT router?
Sep 12 20:07:07 <pppingme>	lll3N1GmAlll__ if your router already knows the route, you don't need to add a static route
Sep 12 20:07:07 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	so, in that instance all i should need is the 1st static route mentioned above correct?
Sep 12 20:07:27 <Aeso>	Thuryn, ah, you're right. Sorry, I was interpreting the description as though there was only a single hop inbetween.
Sep 12 20:07:32 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	i do because there is a VPN split tunnel on this
Sep 12 20:07:50 *	pppingme removes channel operator status from pppingme
Sep 12 20:08:18 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	we want only traffic destined for 2.2.2.0/24 to be routed to the 2.2.2.2 gateway
Sep 12 20:09:30 <pppingme>	if I'm understanding your setup properly, then the route for 2.2.2/24 needs to exist on the router, not the individual pc
Sep 12 20:10:40 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	and it does
Sep 12 20:11:32 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	but i need the PC to have a static route to make sure everything destined for 2.2.2.0/24 goes through the 1.1.1.1 gateway to the router and not out the tun0 VPN device
Sep 12 20:13:08 <pppingme>	Oh, so you have multiple connections on the pc, didn't catch that..
Sep 12 20:13:20 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	yes, sorry. i didnt convey that clearly
Sep 12 20:13:39 <pppingme>	then yes, you'd need a route there too (I'm assuming you're using tun0 as a default route?)
Sep 12 20:14:26 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	yes, tun0 is the default for everything other than the 1.1.1.0/24 and the 2.2.2.0/24
Sep 12 20:14:57 <praxis>	i want to expose a vulnerable vm to the public internet, as a kind of hack-the-box type thing. what do i have to do to make it happen? what are the common pitfalls i need to be aware of
Sep 12 20:15:34 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	praxis, i would not host that from your network
Sep 12 20:16:04 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	host it in a provider that knows what you are doing and why so they can sign off on the appropriate isolation of the VM
Sep 12 20:16:25 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	if you do it on your network you are going to have a bad day if you make any segmentation mistakes
Sep 12 20:17:44 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	if you had to do it at home i'd do it on a physical box on a separate physical switch on a different subnet. this only helps to protect your gear; but doesn't prevent someone from owning the box and using it for purposes that will bring the FBI to oyur door
Sep 12 20:18:13 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	unless you have very robust monitoring (SNORT, OSSEC, etc.) and you watch it 24/7 you are asking for trouble
Sep 12 20:27:35 <praxis>	lll3N1GmAlll__: youthink they're going to break out of the vm or something?
Sep 12 20:28:57 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	they could
Sep 12 20:29:08 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	or they could use it to proxy unsavory items
Sep 12 20:29:28 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	config mishaps account for like 99% of compromises
Sep 12 20:29:33 <praxis>	how? i'll monitor it. it's only going to be up for a few hours
Sep 12 20:31:39 <Guest51>	Habbie, thanks
Sep 12 20:31:40 <praxis>	lll3N1GmAlll__: what about aws? can i use that
Sep 12 20:32:15 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	have to verify with their TOS
Sep 12 20:36:47 <MechKing>	Hello, I am looking for a 8-port  10Gb managed switch. Sub $400 if possible
Sep 12 20:36:59 <MechKing>	Copper (RJ45)
Sep 12 20:38:09 <praxis>	lll3N1GmAlll__: i don't care about that, i just want to know if it's possible. if it works like that. i'm not used to dealing with vms
Sep 12 20:39:14 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	yes as long as you set your NIC on the VM to bridged mode
Sep 12 20:39:30 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	you can setup port forwards justas if it were any other physical PC on the network
Sep 12 20:39:46 <lll3N1GmAlll__>	but, be ye warned. here there be dragons
Sep 12 20:40:31 <TJ->	praxis: you should take a look at https://cybarrior.com/blog/2019/04/30/t-pot-linux/

Sep 15 22:40:14 <bashquest>	and you said your server is running on a vm?
Sep 15 22:40:18 <bashquest>	which vm client?
Sep 15 22:40:47 <bashquest>	are you sure this vm is running on the same network?
Sep 15 22:40:49 <s3ms>	no client is vm
Sep 15 22:40:54 <s3ms>	not server
Sep 15 22:40:59 <bashquest>	wtf....
Sep 15 22:41:16 <bashquest>	be clear please.
Sep 15 22:41:18 <tatertots>	Devastator: if you have made no changes, and have already ruled out "points of failure" like the "cable" or you feel so self confident that you ruled them out without scientific method(s) that's fine...then it's past your demarcation and out of your control..call your vendor or whoever is responsible on the other side
Sep 15 22:41:32 <bashquest>	errors, logs & what u've tried.
Sep 15 22:41:43 <tatertots>	Devastator: there's nothing for you to do
Sep 15 22:41:47 <bashquest>	and configs
Sep 15 22:41:51 <s3ms>	Client is Vm
Sep 15 22:41:52 <tatertots>	Devastator: besides make a phone call
Sep 15 22:41:54 <s3ms>	server is host
Sep 15 22:42:11 <tatertots>	Devastator: if its not on your side..there's nothing you can do but place a phone call
Sep 15 22:42:11 <bashquest>	sure they can reach each other?
Sep 15 22:42:27 <bashquest>	either on the same network or by a bridge or smth the like?
Sep 15 22:42:42 <Devastator>	tatertots actually there is, I can change the IP used for the ping test, I can also change the failure/success parameters so it doesn't give false positives
Sep 15 22:42:52 <hypercore>	what do i do?
Sep 15 22:43:08 <s3ms>	they are not same network.Client is connect my phones network
Sep 15 22:43:34 <catphish>	i just realised that socket programming for text protocols in C is hard
Sep 15 22:43:44 <hypercore>	is there any way to use cloudflare proxy but still have wildcard subdomains?
Sep 15 22:43:46 <catphish>	gotta allocate memory for incoming requests with no idea of their length
Sep 15 22:43:47 <s3ms>	So its different network.
Sep 15 22:43:56 <tatertots>	Devastator: https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/205145990-EdgeRouter-WAN-Load-Balancing
Sep 15 22:44:32 <Devastator>	tatertots yep, load balancing is setup correctly, the problem maybe relies on the IP I use to test the links
Sep 15 22:44:35 <catphish>	hypercore: Cloudflare Enterprise customers can proxy wildcard records
Sep 15 22:44:42 <tatertots>	Devastator: sure since you elected to not use the default shown in the link above and chose to use that IP, change it
Sep 15 22:44:51 <lupine>	consider boycotting cloudflare
Sep 15 22:45:04 <catphish>	hypercore: they don't handly wildcard proxying on free accounts though
Sep 15 22:45:07 <bashquest>	catphish: its not.
Sep 15 22:45:16 <catphish>	bashquest: what?
Sep 15 22:45:21 <tatertots>	Devastator: it would normally be pinging ubnt.ping.com or some ubiquity url
Sep 15 22:45:23 <catphish>	(what is not what?)
Sep 15 22:45:28 <bashquest>	socks in c
Sep 15 22:45:52 <tatertots>	Devastator: use the vendors ping url and see if you get the same results
Sep 15 22:46:07 <catphish>	bashquest: i'm struggling to decide how to allocate memory for incoming request data :(
Sep 15 22:46:15 <tatertots>	Devastator: that still means you're just making a phone call
Sep 15 22:46:30 <catphish>	i start reading a socket with no idea how large the request is (it's newline terminated)
Sep 15 22:46:34 <catphish>	any pointers appreciated
Sep 15 22:46:34 <hypercore>	catphish: what should i do then? is there some way around this without buying an enterpise account?
Sep 15 22:46:38 <bashquest>	catphish: theres no other way than xalloc and free() ....
Sep 15 22:46:54 <Devastator>	tatertots I've decided to use an ip from my country, but sure, I can change to ping.ubnt.com to test
Sep 15 22:46:56 <tatertots>	Devastator: whoever is responsible for the other side 200.160.2.3
Sep 15 22:47:24 <tatertots>	Devastator: yeah i think it's ping.ubnt.com
Sep 15 22:47:38 <catphish>	bashquest: so how do i manage it? how much memory do i alloc when a client starts sending a request? how much do i read from the socket at once, and what do i do if i read beyond the newline that ends the request?
Sep 15 22:48:05 <catphish>	hypercore: use another service, or pay i guess
Sep 15 22:48:06 <bashquest>	then it will block
Sep 15 22:48:15 <bashquest>	depends on the protocol u know...
Sep 15 22:48:57 <bashquest>	if u read() too much, it'll wait forever, till u can read the expected bytes.
Sep 15 22:49:08 <tatertots>	Devastator: i understand wanting to ping something close in geography
Sep 15 22:49:12 <bashquest>	u said it ends by newline.
Sep 15 22:49:31 <bashquest>	so the easiest way is to read 1 byte per read() and stop at \n
Sep 15 22:49:43 <bashquest>	or u do fancy polling crap
Sep 15 22:49:57 <hypercore>	catphish: is there no way to get around this? my situation is i want to use a piece of software that provisons apps (e.g. gitlab) on a server, and it uses *.software.example.com
Sep 15 22:50:10 <tatertots>	Devastator: the vendor ubiquity, in their documentations always show "ping.ubnt.com" being used
Sep 15 22:50:12 <catphish>	hypercore: they explicitly don't support it
Sep 15 22:50:13 <hypercore>	could i just point a standard domain at each app instance when it's created?
Sep 15 22:50:23 <hypercore>	catphish: could i do it manually i mean
Sep 15 22:50:27 <catphish>	you could obviously just make domains as needed, sure
Sep 15 22:50:28 <tatertots>	Devastator: maybe 200.160.2.3 is just been having a bad week
Sep 15 22:50:40 <hypercore>	catphish: cool, thanks
Sep 15 22:50:45 <tatertots>	Devastator: after all...you say you changed nothing on your side
Sep 15 22:51:02 <Devastator>	tatertots yes, ping.ubnt.com has 14 hops :( 200.160.2.3 has 9 hops
Sep 15 22:52:24 <s3ms>	<bashquest> ı have tried in vm : telnet 100.70.37.18 8887 and server: nc -l 8888 and did't work. telnet says trying and error timeout.
Sep 15 22:52:42 <tatertots>	Devastator: that's kinda interesting how ubiquity docs go about configuring it, compared to Dell SonicWall or Fortigate
Sep 15 22:53:15 <bashquest>	s3ms: architectures of the different parties? firewall?
Sep 15 22:53:59 <tatertots>	Devastator: i'm using SonicWall with WAN load balancing
Sep 15 22:54:00 <s3ms>	firewall is closed
Sep 15 22:54:37 <s3ms>	this command locally work by the way
Sep 15 22:54:54 <bashquest>	your server is 100.70.37.18:8887
Sep 15 22:55:01 <bashquest>	whats the ip of the client?
Sep 15 22:56:08 <s3ms>	client ip :176.55.2.81
Sep 15 22:56:40 <bashquest>	but one of them is on a vm, right?
Sep 15 22:56:57 <bashquest>	so, are you routing correctly?
Sep 15 22:57:00 <s3ms>	yes but connect my phone network
Sep 15 22:57:03 <bashquest>	i think: no
Sep 15 22:57:12 <s3ms>	ı have a wireless module
Sep 15 22:57:42 <bashquest>	useless info
Sep 15 22:57:51 <bashquest>	you need network address translation
Sep 15 22:58:05 <bashquest>	or configure your vm to the _same_ network as your host
Sep 15 22:58:09 <bashquest>	then it will work.
Sep 15 22:58:28 <bashquest>	NAT is not simsalabim.
Sep 15 23:00:14 <s3ms>	ı am already can connect same network. I want to connect diffrent network.
Sep 15 23:00:29 <bashquest>	unclear
Sep 15 23:00:31 <bashquest>	again
Sep 15 23:01:52 <bashquest>	school stuff: ping the host, check server status, connect
Sep 15 23:03:06 <bashquest>	look at the logs
Sep 15 23:03:12 <s3ms>	sorry for my english. i was not clear enough
Sep 15 23:03:19 <bashquest>	np
Sep 15 23:03:26 <bashquest>	im also not englender.
Sep 15 23:04:22 <Devastator>	tatertots well, one guy told me to add 200.160.2.3 as static route going out from one link, then another IP, let's say ping.ubnt.com going out from the other link, but I don't see how that would help
Sep 15 23:04:31 <bashquest>	im afk now
Sep 15 23:04:37 <bashquest>	smoking my medical cannabis
Sep 15 23:04:40 <bashquest>	15 mins
Sep 15 23:05:12 <lupine>	die
Sep 15 23:05:17 <bashquest>	and proud
Sep 15 23:05:20 <s3ms>	so question is how can i connect my pc remotely on another pc?
Sep 15 23:05:46 <bashquest>	.... by connecting to the available host ....
Sep 15 23:06:06 <obsrwr>	anyone here used digitalocean before?
Sep 15 23:07:46 <bashquest>	lupine: just rolled the dices for u
Sep 15 23:07:51 <bashquest>	u failed.
Sep 15 23:07:53 <hypercore>	can i have both an A = @ and A = *.app A record?
Sep 15 23:08:30 <lupine>	the pot has clearly addled your wits if you think that's the way to pluralize die
Sep 15 23:08:50 <turtle>	deaded
Sep 15 23:09:18 <turtle>	it's dikes i think
Sep 15 23:10:12 <s3ms>	so modem ip  or internet ip what is diffrence and which should i use
Sep 15 23:11:03 <bashquest>	lupine: cannabinoids make you more unconcentrated yes.
Sep 15 23:11:11 <bashquest>	but i have medical prescription.
Sep 15 23:11:16 <bashquest>	and it works.
Sep 15 23:16:17 <hypercore>	can i have both an A = @ and A = *.app A record?
Sep 15 23:20:44 <Henry151>	halp meh! I moved my router from one room to the other, so had it unplugged for a few minutes, and now it keeps being weird on me
Sep 15 23:20:56 <Henry151>	so i have internet, right now, clearly, because i'm talking to ya
Sep 15 23:21:00 <tom_work>	For anyone who runs a large amount of sites and provides hosted www, mail, and (s)ftp services, about how many unique IP (both v4 and v6) addresses would you say launch automated attacks against your systems?
Sep 15 23:21:04 <Henry151>	but, i can't ping google.com right now
Sep 15 23:21:14 <Henry151>	i'm connected via ssh to my irc bouncer no problem
Sep 15 23:21:23 <Henry151>	but when i try to ping google, there's no response
Sep 15 23:21:23 <tom_work>	more and more I've been coming across a normalized value
Sep 15 23:21:57 <Henry151>	so, I do "systemctl restart network-manager.service" or just click "disconnect" and "reconnect" in my nm-applet, and it works for all of ten seconds just fine, and then the symptom happens again
Sep 15 23:21:57 <tom_work>	of between 300 and 350 unique IP addresses that are repeat offenders
Sep 15 23:22:12 <tom_work>	(not including one-time offenders or transient attacks
Sep 15 23:22:45 <tom_work>	I was curious as to what other net/sys ops encounter running public services
Sep 15 23:22:50 <Henry151>	tom_work: i host a bunch of services from my home server, and so far, have not detected any attacks, but i hear that if you have anything exposed to the internet you're gonna get attacked at some point, so i'm nervously waiting for it
Sep 15 23:23:16 <Henry151>	several websites, an ampache server, a jellyfin server, an airsonic server, and a nextcloud server, all internet-facing
Sep 15 23:23:24 <tatertots>	Devastator: what is your average turn around time on making a change like pinging ping.ubnt.com instead of your custom 200.160.2.3?
Sep 15 23:23:25 <Henry151>	so far, no detected attacks :)
Sep 15 23:23:26 <pclover>	tom_work, define "public services" You mean anything that is public internet facing?
Sep 15 23:23:30 <tom_work>	Henry151, If your not detecting ANY attacks at all you need to investigate your IDS because it's broken
Sep 15 23:23:41 <Henry151>	IDS?
Sep 15 23:23:48 <Henry151>	ah
Sep 15 23:23:50 <tom_work>	intrusion detection system
Sep 15 23:23:52 <Henry151>	intrusion detection system
Sep 15 23:24:12 <Henry151>	so i have "snort" running but with all the default configuration and no idea how it works or how to check it or anything
Sep 15 23:24:12 <Devastator>	tatertots a few minutes, the good thing is that I don't need to reboot the router or anything
Sep 15 23:24:25 <tom_work>	pclover, yes. service on the internet.
Sep 15 23:24:40 <Henry151>	i guess by no "attacks" i mean, nothing that caused any problems that made their way to disrupting end-users or myself.
Sep 15 23:24:43 <pclover>	here mostly low hanging fruit bots
Sep 15 23:25:07 <tom_work>	pclover, how many persistent low fruit bots?
Sep 15 23:25:17 <Henry151>	so, any ideas about why pinging google.com would only work for ten seconds after connecting to the internet, and then would stop working?
Sep 15 23:25:43 <pclover>	tom_work, depends but the entire V4 space is scanned daily so yeah
Sep 15 23:25:44 <Henry151>	google.com just being "random website on the internet" .. i've tried several others as well
Sep 15 23:26:00 <tom_work>	well
Sep 15 23:26:09 <tom_work>	look at this graph I made
Sep 15 23:26:26 <Henry151>	but meanwhile my internet is still working, because, i'm connected via SSH to my IRC bouncer and it's working just fine
Sep 15 23:26:33 <tatertots>	Henry151: what's the actual problem if all connectivity is functioning as intended with the exception of being able to constantly ping google.com
Sep 15 23:26:39 <tom_work>	https://upload.nuegia.net/9a26cb01-610d-4d7a-9533-eaea6d5c96e8/screenshot.png
Sep 15 23:27:02 <tatertots>	Henry151: no one needs to constantly ping google.com 8 hours a day
Sep 15 23:27:06 <Henry151>	tatertots: i'm also unable to access any websites in my browser, forgot to mention that
Sep 15 23:27:27 <Henry151>	it's like, no internet, except for my ssh connection working normally
Sep 15 23:27:39 <tom_work>	Every time I setup a new public server or flush the IDS/IPS database it normalizes back to 300-350 over the course of several months
Sep 15 23:27:46 <pclover>	you getting any browser error?
Sep 15 23:27:59 <earendil>	Henry151: does your DNS lookups work?
Sep 15 23:28:06 <Henry151>	the only thing i get any ping response from at all, is the IP address of the IRC bouncer
Sep 15 23:28:12 <Henry151>	earendil: how do i check that?
Sep 15 23:28:29 <Henry151>	well, when i ping "google.com" it says PING google.com(lga25s56-in-x0e.1e100.net (2607:f8b0:4006:800::200e)) 56 data bytes
Sep 15 23:28:30 <earendil>	Henry151: nslookup, dig
Sep 15 23:28:32 <hypercore>	how do i reset my laptops dns records?
Sep 15 23:29:05 <Henry151>	dig google.com seems to give me something saying "got answer:" with some information
Sep 15 23:29:09 <pclover>	that means DNS is probably working
Sep 15 23:29:24 <tom_work>	and just to give some perspective, each server usually hosts around 250 customers, and has IMAP,POP,SMTP,FTP, and SFTP access open to the internet
Sep 15 23:29:44 <tom_work>	these customers websites are well index by google
Sep 15 23:30:12 <Henry151>	meanwhile, now it's working perfectly, displaying no symptoms
Sep 15 23:30:19 <Henry151>	i'll be back to groan about it if it happens again
Sep 15 23:30:22 <Henry151>	thanks for the help
Sep 15 23:30:49 <tom_work>	I want to know what other netops have detected as in how many repeat offenders, because if this number is accurate, 350 persistent infected zombie machines is actually a very small amount
Sep 15 23:31:00 <tom_work>	well
Sep 15 23:31:35 <tom_work>	wait. I guess my numbers would be kind of skewed because some services are not accessible at all from certain countries like china, russia, bulgaria etc
Sep 15 23:31:55 <hypercore>	how do i reset my laptops dns records?
Sep 15 23:33:07 <tom_work>	hypercore, carefully
Sep 15 23:34:54 <hypercore>	why's that?
Sep 15 23:35:34 <tom_work>	we need to know what OS your using
Sep 15 23:35:39 <hypercore>	arch
Sep 15 23:35:48 <tom_work>	do you have systemd installed?
Sep 15 23:36:15 <hypercore>	yeah
Sep 15 23:37:58 <tom_work>	are you using systemd-resolved or the POSIX resolv.conf?
Sep 15 23:38:56 <hypercore>	not sure actually

Sep 16 09:38:34 <MaxFrames>	hello
Sep 16 09:40:47 <MaxFrames>	is it possible to make a connection between valn x on port x on switch x, and vlan y on port y on switch y, if both vlan x and vlan y are tagged on the respective ports? i.e. "move" packets from vlan x to vlan y? and what if either or both vlans are not tagged on the interface?
Sep 16 09:43:15 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Sure.
Sep 16 09:44:18 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Or rather, it depends on the switch.
Sep 16 09:44:49 <MaxFrames>	so you can move packets between vlans, untag them if they are tagged, tag them if they are untagged, and change their tag (generally speaking, considerations on the specific switches aside)
Sep 16 09:50:44 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: It depends on the switch. A good L2 switch can do out with basic stanzas, some of the shittier ones might require L3 features.
Sep 16 09:51:48 <MaxFrames>	ok, I just wanted to know if in theory it can work like that. tbh I always had some problems understanding vlan tagging
Sep 16 09:52:32 <MaxFrames>	as I see, it's really used to tell one vlan from another, but nothing theoretically prevents adding/removing/changing these tags while at the same time moving packets to a different vlan
Sep 16 09:53:13 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: So the difference is thisÖ
Sep 16 09:53:23 <detha>	That would make it one vlan, just with different tags on each port :p
Sep 16 09:53:25 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Some switches like cisco with iOS implement a DSL
Sep 16 09:53:45 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: That DSL has some semantics, forcing you to think of VLANs are these actual networks that somehow exist.
Sep 16 09:53:46 <earendil>	MaxFrames: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q#Frame_format
Sep 16 09:54:07 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Others like UBNT give you stanzas that explicit draw packets from a VLAN but tag it with a different vlan
Sep 16 09:54:10 <earendil>	its not that you "move" the packets, as much as you just change that header
Sep 16 09:54:18 <MaxFrames>	detha: yes
Sep 16 09:55:30 <detha>	I am trying to find a use case for this
Sep 16 09:55:31 <MaxFrames>	earendil: yes, by moving I mean that they reach the other switch
Sep 16 09:56:32 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Look into VLAN mapping/translation in your switches manuals.
Sep 16 09:56:40 <dminuoso>	(Thats what the feature is called)
Sep 16 09:57:44 <MaxFrames>	also "vlan rewriting" possibly?
Sep 16 09:57:50 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Possibly.
Sep 16 09:59:00 <MaxFrames>	the use case would be pass traffic between two bridged interfaces in pfsense. one interface would be on vlan x and the other in vlan y
Sep 16 09:59:03 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: Just make sure you consider which tranfer VLAN is used on your switches backplane.
Sep 16 09:59:20 <dminuoso>	MaxFrames: (Since if you used say VLAN 10 as the transfer, and you connect other switchports to 10 you are bridging VLANs)
Sep 16 09:59:26 <earendil>	huh interesting. i did not know double tagging was a thing
Sep 16 09:59:46 <dminuoso>	earendil: Fun fact, you can do this an arbitrary number of times.
Sep 16 10:00:09 <dminuoso>	earendil: You can do Q-in-Q-in-Q-in-Q...
Sep 16 10:00:22 <dminuoso>	(Shrinking your MTU each time of course)
Sep 16 10:00:29 <detha>	until you run out of MTU
Sep 16 10:00:43 <doxxy>	autism strong as hell in here right ni
Sep 16 10:09:27 <mrtnt>	When I execute "ip l set dev eth0 down" in qemu guest, then is it somehow possible to see this in host machine? I guess no. It is possible to change the guest network adapter link status from qemu monitor with "set_link <name> on/off", but there does not seem to be a way to read the link status from host.
Sep 16 10:12:18 <azonenberg>	Can anyone ID this switch? Just out of curiosity https://imgur.com/gallery/BuzbPgi
Sep 16 10:12:32 <azonenberg>	looks like an older cisco, probably catalyst 2xxx series, with dual GBIC uplinks?
Sep 16 10:12:48 <azonenberg>	feels kinda like a 2950 but i havent seen one in exactly this config
Sep 16 10:14:32 <mrtnt>	azonenberg: Cisco ME3400 ?
Sep 16 10:16:07 <mrtnt>	azonenberg: it should be ME-3400-24TS-A
Sep 16 10:16:08 <azonenberg>	ME3400-24TS is a pretty close fit
Sep 16 10:16:11 <azonenberg>	yeah
Sep 16 10:17:25 <azonenberg>	On a different note, a few minutes ago i brought up some initial skeleton code on an FPGA devkit, I now have three (four as soon as i find another LC multimode patch cable that I'm not using for something more important) 10Gbase-SR links to various ports on my core switch
Sep 16 10:18:12 <azonenberg>	Won't have time to do much tonight but tomorrow i'm hoping to get my switch fabric running on real hardware for more extensive testing
Sep 16 10:18:26 <azonenberg>	I have a single 1000base-T interface on the devkit that isnt wired up yet
Sep 16 10:18:53 <azonenberg>	So i'll be able to model all four uplinks plus one of the 24 edge ports
Sep 16 10:19:26 <azonenberg>	The FPGA i'm using for the testing is bigger, faster, and waaaay more expensive than the one my actual hardware will have, but that also means i can forget about optimizing during initial testing
Sep 16 10:19:55 <mrtnt>	azonenberg: what devkit are you using?
Sep 16 10:19:59 <azonenberg>	Step one, i think, will be to send all outbound traffic to /dev/null and just verify the MAC address table is correctly learning addresses from broadcasts etc
Sep 16 10:20:11 <azonenberg>	mrtnt: vcu118. Slightly overkill
Sep 16 10:20:22 <linux_probe>	lol
Sep 16 10:20:24 <azonenberg>	But it was that or an ac701, none of my other devkits have any SFPs at all
Sep 16 10:20:29 <azonenberg>	And the ac701 sfp maxes out at 6G
Sep 16 10:20:32 <azonenberg>	and there's only one interface
Sep 16 10:20:45 <azonenberg>	The actual switch will have a kintex-7, xc7k160t-2fbg484c
Sep 16 10:20:57 <azonenberg>	assuming i manage to make the fabric fit in it
Sep 16 10:21:11 <azonenberg>	Other changes, i'm using on chip block RAM for the prototype platform
Sep 16 10:21:29 <azonenberg>	the real hardware doesn't have enough on chip ram for all of the fifos so i'm using external qdr-ii+ for the edge ports then on-chip ram only for the uplinks
Sep 16 10:21:41 <azonenberg>	(since the QDR doesn't have enough bandwidth to keep up with 4x 10G interfaces)
Sep 16 10:22:20 <azonenberg>	But the good news is i dont have to change anything, i can just drop down the block ram based fifo i already wrote for the uplinks and use it for the single edge port in the prototype
Sep 16 10:22:43 <azonenberg>	then just tie off all 23 other fabric ports to be down all the time
Sep 16 10:23:16 <azonenberg>	The other thing i have to work out still, on the testing infrastructure side, is some kind of ribbon cable to jumper the vcu118 to the actual hardware for the management engine
Sep 16 10:23:24 <azonenberg>	So i can get the CLI talking to the registers on the prototype
Sep 16 10:23:58 <azonenberg>	Right now the vcu118 is on my "big devkits and UPS" rack and the management card is on a lab bench, so i'll have to rack it
Sep 16 10:24:17 <azonenberg>	But i'll worry about that once i have the prototype switching packets with hard wired vlan assignments
Sep 16 10:24:26 <azonenberg>	and dumping performance counters etc over jtag
Sep 16 10:24:29 <azonenberg>	that's good enough to get started
Sep 16 10:27:53 <linux_probe>	re-lol
Sep 16 10:28:08 <azonenberg>	The vcu118 also does have another QSFP28 interface, so if i want to be really dirty
Sep 16 10:28:22 <azonenberg>	I can add another four 1G interfaces by running each lane of that QSFP at 1G
Sep 16 10:28:40 <azonenberg>	Running 1000base-SX on a 100GbE port with a 40Gbase-SR4 optic in it just feels wrong though
Sep 16 10:50:13 <julius_>	hi
Sep 16 10:58:03 <julius_>	how high is the change that gaming servers for playerunknowns battleground hostet in the amazon cloud are  running better late at night?  im pretty positive that they do, game feels more fluid.  so im wondering if this is on their side or my cable connection is just better  late at night >23oclock
Sep 16 10:58:33 <julius_>	ive run iperf3 in the middle of the day and theres just a small jitter
Sep 16 10:59:39 <djph>	julius_: yes to both.
Sep 16 11:00:48 <SpiritHorse>	julius_: will run better off peak for all the obvious reasons... not much to do with your bandwidth, moreso the load on the gaming server itself
Sep 16 11:02:13 <julius_>	yes its not the bandwith which is pretty stable, maybe small packets getting delayed just a tiny bit
Sep 16 11:02:23 <SpiritHorse>	layer 3 ping and layer 7 ping are two completely different animals... former likely fluctuates very little, later probably very load dependent
Sep 16 11:03:30 <julius_>	right, but its hard to measure game performance just from a wireshark dump
Sep 16 11:03:31 <SpiritHorse>	I notice this on most games I track ping on... Sea of Thieves, CS:GO, my connection to Azure/etc is always the same... just depends on how bogged down their servers are at any given moment
Sep 16 11:03:40 <SpiritHorse>	yes, that is true
Sep 16 11:04:18 <julius_>	at least i didnt came up with a repeatable measurement for ingame load besides my gut feeling
Sep 16 11:04:39 <SpiritHorse>	pubg has no in-game ping measurement which is pretty lame if you ask me
Sep 16 11:04:47 <julius_>	it does
Sep 16 11:05:16 <julius_>	you can activate network diagnostics
Sep 16 11:05:19 <julius_>	ingame
Sep 16 11:05:28 <SpiritHorse>	and it displays while playing or is it a 1-time diag?
Sep 16 11:05:41 <SpiritHorse>	been forever since I've played pubg if you can't tell
Sep 16 11:05:44 <julius_>	like in csgo netgraph
Sep 16 11:05:47 <SpiritHorse>	ah
Sep 16 11:05:51 <julius_>	yes they added that later
Sep 16 11:06:57 <Capprentice>	How do you configure mac time out value in Switch?
Sep 16 11:07:09 <julius_>	but it does not correlate to ingame "lag" when you play, could be just a ping running in the background not dependent on the game itself like they did in battlefield 3 - there they added a icmp ping as a seperate connection and showed the result
Sep 16 11:11:09 <light>	Capprentice: mac address-table aging-time <seconds>
Sep 16 11:11:41 <Capprentice>	Its set to 300 sec. What will go wrong If its lowered to 60 secs?
Sep 16 11:11:54 <light>	your switch might catch on fire
Sep 16 11:12:19 <light>	it will just cause more broadcasts
Sep 16 11:13:02 <earendil>	SpiritHorse: pubg has a lot of lame shit about it
Sep 16 11:13:25 <SpiritHorse>	earendil: I've been Battle Royal'd out so haven't touched it in ages
Sep 16 11:13:41 <earendil>	SpiritHorse: 292 hours of it :( a bunch recently
Sep 16 11:14:04 <earendil>	its a shit game but its about the only fix i can find for craving 4 player squad, semirealistic shooter
Sep 16 11:14:19 <SpiritHorse>	got in Apex for a minute and it was hackers galore, just hung the genre up for now.  having fun doing other stuff, I'll circle back soon enough.
Sep 16 11:14:58 <earendil>	oh, some generic game from EA, no wonder. i don't buy EA anything, especially if it requires origin
Sep 16 11:16:34 <earendil>	SpiritHorse: i don't see how any game like the division or pubg can ever stop script kiddies, because they use client side hit eval
Sep 16 11:16:49 <SpiritHorse>	yah that's why I don't fuck with it that much
Sep 16 11:17:01 <earendil>	server side is really the only realistic help there, and its still bad even with that
Sep 16 11:17:52 <SpiritHorse>	closed competition is where it's at, sadly
Sep 16 11:18:09 <julius_>	earendil try "tarkov" - its hardcore realistet but runs crap currently
Sep 16 11:18:10 <SpiritHorse>	you get a group of guys who are good enough and pride themselves on winning with skill and not hax, and, game on
Sep 16 11:18:35 <earendil>	well, could be worse. i have been a long time tekken player, all in arcades and local play. my couple forays into online gameplay scarred me beyond redemption
Sep 16 11:18:58 <earendil>	SpiritHorse: don't really know anyone like that anymore. all the locals moved, priced out of the region
Sep 16 11:19:23 <SpiritHorse>	I just network with people on gaming sites like Twitch etc
Sep 16 11:19:25 <earendil>	julius_: i like the look, but i've been skeptical of tarkov. least of all, not being able to buy the game, or it was too expensive, or whatever
Sep 16 11:19:36 <julius_>	everybody should register a account with ther personal id online and games should check that index to see if they got banned anywhere. so its one ban in any game and youre out
Sep 16 11:19:36 <earendil>	ugh, twitch
Sep 16 11:19:46 <SpiritHorse>	you can spot a hero from a zero a mile away watching them stream for a few minutes
Sep 16 11:20:00 <SpiritHorse>	chat a bit, ask to play, boom, network enhance.
Sep 16 11:20:15 <earendil>	i learned to fucking hate twitch when playing dayz
Sep 16 11:20:29 <SpiritHorse>	oh yeah there is tons of trash on twitch
Sep 16 11:20:42 <earendil>	their obvious uneven treatment of streamers and thots is just the icing on the cake
Sep 16 11:20:44 <SpiritHorse>	but also a lot of decent people I've met over the years
Sep 16 11:20:51 <julius_>	earendil at least the european servers suck. but if you like realism its the way to go
Sep 16 11:20:51 <SpiritHorse>	well yeah
Sep 16 11:20:56 <SpiritHorse>	it's Jeff Bezos
Sep 16 11:21:03 <SpiritHorse>	ANTIFA overloard
Sep 16 11:21:17 <earendil>	julius_: what's it cost to buy now? or is it still semiclosed betas
Sep 16 11:21:39 <SpiritHorse>	titty streamers are wack
Sep 16 11:21:42 <earendil>	i joke with pubg that knowing anything about firearms in real life is a handicap
Sep 16 11:21:45 <SpiritHorse>	nothin against tits
Sep 16 11:21:56 *	SpiritHorse got a pair of his own
Sep 16 11:22:04 <julius_>	yeah tits are great
Sep 16 11:22:19 <julius_>	twitch is the softporn of the new centurys
Sep 16 11:22:20 <earendil>	actual titty streamers have great beef against twitch thots, and rightfully so. sex workers pretending they're not
Sep 16 11:22:49 <julius_>	"twitch thots" ? whats tha
Sep 16 11:22:49 <julius_>	t
Sep 16 11:23:03 <earendil>	thot, that hoe over there
Sep 16 11:23:16 <julius_>	ah
Sep 16 11:23:17 <earendil>	girls who stream on twitch pretending to be gamers but really are just doing soft pr0n
Sep 16 11:23:23 <earendil>	begging for money
Sep 16 11:23:37 <SpiritHorse>	they shook it up a bit when they disbanded the "in real life" section of Twitch... the cam sluts went wild, but have since regrouped under the "just chatting" section of Twitch
Sep 16 11:23:39 <nsk_nyc>	wondering if anyone could help me out with a setup. I have an rv215 router connected to internet, there are some clients connected to it. An sg350(switch with l3 capability) connected to the rv215
Sep 16 11:23:39 <earendil>	but because they bring in so much money from the thirsty, they're... not just tolerated, but encouraged
Sep 16 11:23:50 <SpiritHorse>	https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Just%20Chatting
Sep 16 11:23:55 <SpiritHorse>	hors galore
Sep 16 11:23:55 <nsk_nyc>	not sure if this is an optimal setup, but I'm a bit stuck
Sep 16 11:24:33 <nsk_nyc>	reason I'm using the sg as a router is becase the rv215 can only have 20 static ip.. as well as many other limitations 20 acl etc
Sep 16 11:24:53 <nsk_nyc>	so I'd rather just have the rv215 connected to internet and the sg350 doing the rest
Sep 16 11:25:00 <earendil>	nsk_nyc: not familiar with that hardware, but sounds ridiculous. a friggin pi could do more
Sep 16 11:25:17 <nsk_nyc>	my point exactly
Sep 16 11:25:20 <julius_>	ok im off to luch, thanks guys
Sep 16 11:25:26 <nsk_nyc>	cisco limited it hard core
Sep 16 11:25:40 <SpiritHorse>	shit is it actually lunch time
Sep 16 11:25:47 <julius_>	of course, they want to see the bigger beasts as well
Sep 16 11:25:57 <julius_>	sell
Sep 16 11:26:01 <nsk_nyc>	right
Sep 16 11:26:02 <earendil>	still kind of fucked
Sep 16 11:26:30 <earendil>	nsk_nyc: that aside, the general best practice is to have a separate border gateway device and internal switchstack
Sep 16 11:26:31 <nsk_nyc>	thing is i tried setting up vlan but I just couldn't get stuff to communicate
Sep 16 11:27:14 <nsk_nyc>	alright, so the rv215 is the border correct. I'd like to get internet there and just control the rest from the switch
Sep 16 11:27:18 <nsk_nyc>	connected to it.
Sep 16 11:27:25 <earendil>	from what you described yeah
Sep 16 11:27:25 <nsk_nyc>	dhcp and all is working its supplying ips etc
Sep 16 11:27:38 <nsk_nyc>	i just can't get access outside
Sep 16 11:28:01 <nsk_nyc>	i figured it was a dns issue, but then I'd be able to ping 8.8.8.8
Sep 16 11:28:02 <earendil>	from the LAN going to internet, or forwarding ports into the LAN from outside?
Sep 16 11:28:14 <nsk_nyc>	but I can't go to wan from lan
Sep 16 11:28:26 <nsk_nyc>	I disabled dhcp on the router right.
Sep 16 11:29:05 <nsk_nyc>	enabled it on the switch
Sep 16 11:29:13 <earendil>	should only be one DHCP server, at least in a small network
Sep 16 11:29:14 <nsk_nyc>	i ahte calling it a switch its a bit misleading
Sep 16 11:29:28 <nsk_nyc>	Right its only enabled on the sg350
Sep 16 11:30:00 <nsk_nyc>	no acl's no filters other than reserved ip's
Sep 16 11:30:21 <earendil>	is the switch and router on the same bridged LAN subnet?
Sep 16 11:30:27 <nsk_nyc>	yes
Sep 16 11:30:33 <_F3B0_>	how i can hide my real ip??
Sep 16 11:30:35 <nsk_nyc>	router is 192.168.1.1
Sep 16 11:30:46 <nsk_nyc>	switch is 192.168.1.6
Sep 16 11:30:58 <earendil>	what default gateway are your client hosts getting from DHCP
Sep 16 11:31:05 <nsk_nyc>	the switch's IP
Sep 16 11:31:09 <nsk_nyc>	192.168.1.6
Sep 16 11:31:10 <earendil>	shoudl be router
Sep 16 11:31:16 <earendil>	because its a flat subnet, no routing
Sep 16 11:31:27 <E1ephant>	roger dodger
Sep 16 11:31:33 <E1ephant>	10-4
Sep 16 11:31:33 <nsk_nyc>	I tried setting it static and still can't access the internet
Sep 16 11:31:37 <earendil>	going out host->.6->.1, coming in 1.->host and host goes wtf
Sep 16 11:31:51 <nsk_nyc>	AH
Sep 16 11:31:59 <E1ephant>	well host .6 would be sending an ipredirect if it's supported
Sep 16 11:31:59 <nsk_nyc>	sorry caps
Sep 16 11:32:09 <E1ephant>	but you should not design for ipredirect use
Sep 16 11:32:24 <earendil>	inside subnet, you want the actual gateway
Sep 16 11:32:32 <E1ephant>	^
Sep 16 11:32:33 <earendil>	and that is .1, the router
Sep 16 11:32:53 <nsk_nyc>	I have to tell the switch that the gateway is .1 then?
Sep 16 11:33:13 <nsk_nyc>	its dhcp would relay this to hosts I assume
Sep 16 11:33:38 <E1ephant>	no everyone in the subnet
Sep 16 11:34:15 <nsk_nyc>	Right, i say this ebcause the switch (sg350) is the dhcp server
Sep 16 11:34:25 <E1ephant>	ouch
Sep 16 11:34:39 <nsk_nyc>	this is the conflict eh?
Sep 16 11:34:52 <nsk_nyc>	its telling everyone IT is the dg
Sep 16 11:34:53 <nsk_nyc>	?
Sep 16 11:35:02 <E1ephant>	idk is it?
Sep 16 11:35:06 <nsk_nyc>	yes
Sep 16 11:35:10 <E1ephant>	you said it was point hosts at .6
Sep 16 11:35:18 <E1ephant>	which yes is incorrect, it should point at .1
Sep 16 11:35:22 <nsk_nyc>	right .6 is the switch
Sep 16 11:35:37 <nsk_nyc>	which is not the border
Sep 16 11:35:42 <E1ephant>	are you trying to do routing on your switch?
Sep 16 11:35:47 <nsk_nyc>	correct
Sep 16 11:35:52 <E1ephant>	put a /31 between the router and switch
Sep 16 11:35:59 <earendil>	a DHCP server can tell anyone what the gateway is, if you specify
Sep 16 11:36:04 <E1ephant>	and put the network directly on the switch
Sep 16 11:36:14 <earendil>	that would be the other fix, just more work typically
Sep 16 11:36:27 <E1ephant>	you need to use a different, non-overlapping subnet in order to route
Sep 16 11:36:34 <E1ephant>	inside the same subnet, you should only be switching.
Sep 16 11:37:32 <nsk_nyc>	so lan---router---192.168.1.0/24----switch----.2.0/24-lan
Sep 16 11:37:44 <linux_probe>	seems they're trying to get around the limit of their routers vlan and vpn uncapability, by using a switch behind it lol
Sep 16 11:37:44 <nsk_nyc>	there hosts on the other side
Sep 16 11:37:57 <E1ephant>	I mean I don't know if I would trust an sg or an rv further than I could throw it
Sep 16 11:38:05 <earendil>	sounds lik garbage hardware :(
Sep 16 11:38:07 <E1ephant>	so I would probably just do roas
Sep 16 11:38:20 <E1ephant>	nsk_nyc: why a /24?
Sep 16 11:38:27 <earendil>	because you can? heh
Sep 16 11:38:31 <E1ephant>	seems dumb
Sep 16 11:38:50 <earendil>	nsk_nyc: if you ever want to do VPN crap, i'd advise you not to use the same subnets that EVERYONE uses
Sep 16 11:38:53 <nsk_nyc>	@linux_probe exactly, not the vpn  just the damn acl, static ips limitations
Sep 16 11:39:01 <E1ephant>	yeah I like 172.16/12
Sep 16 11:39:07 <E1ephant>	for least-conflicting
Sep 16 11:39:09 <E1ephant>	but meh
Sep 16 11:39:21 <earendil>	can be a /24, just higher up
Sep 16 11:39:40 <E1ephant>	still just a huge wastye for ptp link
Sep 16 11:40:02 <nsk_nyc>	well i'm not particularly good with this stuff sorry.
Sep 16 11:40:28 <nsk_nyc>	if there are better suggestions I'd definitely would appreciate it
Sep 16 11:40:28 <djph>	E1ephant: I usually go for 172.24/13
Sep 16 11:40:29 <earendil>	a /31 is firmware related anyway, not all hardware can do that
Sep 16 11:40:48 <E1ephant>	djph: /13 :P u wot?
Sep 16 11:41:04 <earendil>	personally i like 10.x.y. /24's
Sep 16 11:41:12 <earendil>	x for site, y for subnets
Sep 16 11:41:14 <E1ephant>	earendil: anything that doesn't do /31 in 2019 should probably not be in production :()
Sep 16 11:41:18 <E1ephant>	eewww
Sep 16 11:41:28 <E1ephant>	encoding information into IPs doesn't scale well
Sep 16 11:41:31 <earendil>	E1ephant: what, like some junk hardware that only allows you to have 20 static ip? lol
Sep 16 11:41:35 <linux_probe>	https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-have-started-attacks-on-cisco-rv110-rv130-and-rv215-routers/
Sep 16 11:41:46 <linux_probe>	patch if you havent allready lol
Sep 16 11:41:51 <E1ephant>	yeah sounds about right :)
Sep 16 11:41:57 <nsk_nyc>	its updated thanks :)
Sep 16 11:42:16 <djph>	E1ephant: upper half of 172.16/12
Sep 16 11:42:24 <earendil>	E1ephant: talking about personal small networks. not friggin enterprise level international WANs
Sep 16 11:42:25 <E1ephant>	djph: ahhh, yeah good call imho
Sep 16 11:42:45 <E1ephant>	earendil: but that is what DNS is for? :P
Sep 16 11:42:55 <koollman>	E1ephant: it scales decently. if you reach a limit, go for ipv6 ;)
Sep 16 11:43:02 <E1ephant>	or dcim or ipam or literally anything else :)
Sep 16 11:43:25 <E1ephant>	your excel spreadsheet ipam
Sep 16 11:43:28 <djph>	earendil: long as you're in control of the two endpoints, that's fine
Sep 16 11:43:29 <earendil>	E1ephant: no, DNS or any of those other things don't do VLAN segmenting or other broadcast separation
Sep 16 11:43:46 <E1ephant>	earendil: for information store
Sep 16 11:44:12 <E1ephant>	all the fixed x and y inb your 10/8 is widening your chance of overlap if you ever need to merge with another network
Sep 16 11:44:47 <E1ephant>	renumbering a huge allocation, or doing NAT long term for migration are not great :?
Sep 16 11:45:19 <earendil>	E1ephant: i said /24, not /8 :P
Sep 16 11:45:27 <E1ephant>	right, the rfc1918 allocation is /8
Sep 16 11:46:10 <earendil>	why the fuck would i use a /8 for anything
Sep 16 11:46:26 <TJ->	earendil: xmas tree lights :)
Sep 16 11:46:37 <E1ephant>	earendil: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918
Sep 16 11:47:06 <earendil>	fwiw, whenever i've dealt with existing networks, be they tiny business or giant multinational, the network schema is already written in stone. ain't like i can just renumber shit for convenience. that's where 1:1 NAT table comes in
Sep 16 11:47:20 <E1ephant>	gross
Sep 16 11:47:35 <earendil>	welcome to the real world, it doesn't care about your sensitivities
Sep 16 11:47:38 <E1ephant>	eh
Sep 16 11:47:43 <E1ephant>	wait till you have real scale
Sep 16 11:48:18 <linux_probe>	10.0.0.0/8 is great
Sep 16 11:48:22 <earendil>	what's real scale, hundreds of VPN concentrators, thousands of firewalls and physical sites?
Sep 16 11:48:26 <linux_probe>	as a firewall rule to block it all
Sep 16 11:49:18 <E1ephant>	earendil: 100,000 switches, 15,000 Juniper MX routers
Sep 16 11:49:49 <E1ephant>	errr added a zero there, but meh with tooling it's the same
Sep 16 11:50:02 <earendil>	so yeah i've worked on stuff at that scale :P
Sep 16 11:50:02 <mrbell1984>	add a 0 to the 0
Sep 16 11:50:24 <earendil>	but you seem to be willfully stupid when i said personal networks, not international WANs :P
Sep 16 11:50:27 <E1ephant>	earendil: then you would have seen these issues?
Sep 16 11:50:32 <julius_>	ive got a port dump switch in my home
Sep 16 11:50:32 <earendil>	and /24's, not whole /8's
Sep 16 11:50:36 <julius_>	8 port
Sep 16 11:50:41 <E1ephant>	I mean if you can't read rfcs
Sep 16 11:50:45 <E1ephant>	not my problem
Sep 16 11:50:47 <earendil>	E1ephant: yeah. unfortunately i have. hence dealing with shit like 1:1 NAT tables
Sep 16 11:50:59 <nsk_nyc>	i hate to interrupt, but in the end I was recommended to place the router in one sub and the switch in another?
Sep 16 11:51:02 <E1ephant>	earendil: 1:1 NAT how is that any example of scale
Sep 16 11:51:15 <earendil>	E1ephant: its an example of a bandaid for an existing clusterfuck
Sep 16 11:51:16 <E1ephant>	statfulness is the enemy
Sep 16 11:51:28 <earendil>	like connecting two different hospitals over IPSEC VPN
Sep 16 11:51:39 <earendil>	and neither one is willing to change :P
Sep 16 11:51:47 <E1ephant>	ahhh I see
Sep 16 11:51:53 <E1ephant>	you're always the cost center
Sep 16 11:52:02 <E1ephant>	and built stuff with sticks and glue
Sep 16 11:52:07 <earendil>	i'm an internet plumber, fixing other peoples poor decisions :P
Sep 16 11:52:27 <earendil>	can't fix their poor decisions because they're not willing to spend the money to do it right
Sep 16 11:52:31 <E1ephant>	I would higly suggest moving to being the product side, you get a lot more corp money and attention :)
Sep 16 11:54:19 <E1ephant>	although cable ISPs might question that thought process :}
Sep 16 11:56:52 <earendil>	E1ephant: if i wanted that, i'd throw out any semblance of morals and ethics, become a lawyer, and go fuck people for money like a proper whore
Sep 16 12:02:11 <E1ephant>	earendil: eh, it was your complaint!
Sep 16 12:02:35 <E1ephant>	fine by me if you like that :)
Sep 16 12:04:05 <E1ephant>	buf13
Sep 16 12:24:32 <skyroveRR>	 
Sep 16 12:24:34 <skyroveRR>	...
Sep 16 12:24:36 <skyroveRR>	oopsie.
Sep 16 12:24:42 <skyroveRR>	Heya E1ephant
Sep 16 12:37:05 <E1ephant>	skyroveRR: hey-o!
Sep 16 12:43:11 <skyroveRR>	I've got an IP address, which, during a particular time of the day, takes a longer route to reach the destination via traceroute with a huge amount of ping drops in between. The latency is about 140ms, with one ping reply having response of 140ms every 5 timeouts and sometimes one ping reply every 15-20 timeouts. The traceroute hop count is 15. After about 4 hours, which actually is a rough guess, ping
Sep 16 12:43:13 <skyroveRR>	automatically stabilizes, there are no drops, and the hop count reduces to 6. I've created a paste of the traceroutes for reference: http://pktsurf.in/p/traceroute.txt . That IP is just a sample. I've tested a couple of IPs from active hosts on this subnet, which is /24, and a couple of other /24s belonging to the same company, and the observation is the same. Any ideas where to get started?
Sep 16 12:46:48 <TJ->	skyroveRR: identify the router where the paths diverge
Sep 16 12:47:28 <skyroveRR>	TJ-: I did. That's the ISPs router, over which I have no control over.
Sep 16 12:49:09 <skyroveRR>	Probably doing BGP. What should I tell the ISP?
Sep 16 12:49:49 <linux_probe>	ping times along the route are semi useful, but they're the lowest of priority packets, meaning they'll be the first thing dropped if the routers are busy
Sep 16 12:50:58 <skyroveRR>	linux_probe: which protocol demands the highest priority?
Sep 16 12:51:44 <linux_probe>	actually, traceroute should be / is probably using UDP by default
Sep 16 12:51:54 <TandyUK>	so how would you guys deal with an isp whos backhaul is insufficient - in the uk, BT provided 'last mile', data sent over BT's network to telehouse, then packet loss caused by insufficient transit between BT & ISP's own cores.
Sep 16 12:52:16 <tds>	is this happening consistently, or just on one or a few occasions? I wouldn't expect paths to flap regularly like that, but more just during maintenance etc
Sep 16 12:52:34 <skyroveRR>	tds: once every three days.
Sep 16 12:52:40 <skyroveRR>	Even four days.
Sep 16 12:52:44 <TandyUK>	for the past week we've seen fluctuating loss of between 3 and 13%, starting from 9am each day, and continuing to 2/3/4pm, every single day
Sep 16 12:53:03 <TandyUK>	considering our clients use these connections for voip, thts virtually unusable
Sep 16 12:53:09 <linux_probe>	maybe you have an older traceroute though, they did cvhange things along the line
Sep 16 12:54:13 <skyroveRR>	linux_probe: I took the second one after about 40 mins after things normalized.
Sep 16 12:54:38 <linux_probe>	try adding -T to the traceroute line
Sep 16 12:55:27 <skyroveRR>	For TCP, right.
Sep 16 12:55:32 <linux_probe>	if it's capable that will use TCP Syn probes lol
Sep 16 12:55:50 <linux_probe>	-I for icmp and -U for UDP ( it may or may not support any of that)
Sep 16 12:56:05 <skyroveRR>	It's just a test IP, IDK that hosts' capability.
Sep 16 12:56:13 <skyroveRR>	But I'll try anyways.
Sep 16 12:58:00 <tds>	is AS136334 your isp?
Sep 16 12:58:17 <TJ->	skyroveRR: try using 'echoping'
Sep 16 12:58:50 <earendil>	hrm, i've heard of ISPs that will honor QoS from customers, ask them?
Sep 16 12:59:06 <earendil>	i mean what else can you really do other than take it up with the ISP
Sep 16 12:59:12 <skyroveRR>	tds: yes indeed.
Sep 16 13:00:52 <tds>	bgp.he.net can see that both of those networks are peered, so some route collector somewhere must have visibility on at least one side, that might be useful to see what's going on
Sep 16 13:01:08 <tds>	do you see the same behaviour in the other direction?
Sep 16 13:01:34 <skyroveRR>	Yes I do.
Sep 16 13:01:48 <skyroveRR>	Same thing, same story.
Sep 16 13:05:50 <markweston>	Hi! I deleted all the routes of an old Windows Vista computer. I don't have any windows experience. Please help me. I want to connect it to the local network consisting of four components. The old Windows vista computer (192.168.1.111) is connected to an OpenWRT router (192.168.1.1), which is connected to a Desktop Linux computer (192.168.1.100) which is connected to a small OpenWRT router (192.168.1.2). I tried "route add 192.168
Sep 16 13:07:11 <markweston>	Basically I need three routes, (192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.100 via 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 via 192.168.1.1). I just don't know how to add them on Windows Vista.
Sep 16 13:07:27 <markweston>	All the masks in the routes are 255.255.255.255
Sep 16 13:07:35 <linux_probe>	oh lord
Sep 16 13:08:02 <detha>	you broke it well
Sep 16 13:08:32 <markweston>	I deleted all the routes in a Linux computer and nothing bad happened, I could re-add them just fine
Sep 16 13:10:07 <detha>	route -p add 0.0.0.0 mask 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1
Sep 16 13:10:48 <tds>	skyroveRR: oh, looks like one of your providers is transit for the other
Sep 16 13:10:59 <tds>	so if that route is changing, it should be visible to lots of the rest of the internet
Sep 16 13:33:15 <mrtnt>	I stumbled on Junos outbound SSH service(https://www.juniper.net/documentation/software/topics/task/configuration/ssh-outbound-service-configuring.pdf) which essentially makes a SSH connection to SSH server from the network device. What is the point of this? Does it allow the server to somehow make the SSH connection back to network device?
Sep 16 13:34:26 <mrtnt>	I'm simply wondering is it some sort of niche SSH feature which I'm not aware of..
Sep 16 13:36:51 <shambat>	is it possible for a smaller CIDR-block to be only partially inside a larger CIDR-block?
Sep 16 13:38:51 <dminuoso>	shambat: Yes.
Sep 16 13:39:23 <shambat>	dminuoso: do you have an example?
Sep 16 13:39:52 <dminuoso>	shambat: Well let me put it this way.
Sep 16 13:40:02 <dminuoso>	shambat: Do you, technically, understand what a netmask is?
Sep 16 13:40:10 <shambat>	yes
Sep 16 13:40:11 <xand>	shambat: no
Sep 16 13:40:19 <xand>	it can't overlap the end
Sep 16 13:40:35 <dminuoso>	xand: well it depends on what you mean by "cant"
Sep 16 13:40:42 <dminuoso>	xand: You can in the sense that you can misdesign your network.
Sep 16 13:40:44 <shambat>	in the real world
Sep 16 13:40:52 <dminuoso>	But you are not supposed to. ;)

Sep 17 10:36:07 <muAdmDev>	I moved a hostname to a different server and therefore IP address. nslookup got the current IP. But a service - running on the same machine I ran "nslookup" - tried to connect to the old IP address upon restart. Any hints why that is?
Sep 17 10:36:44 <E1ephant>	is it set in /etc/hosts or anything?
Sep 17 10:36:59 <muAdmDev>	 E1ephant: no
Sep 17 10:37:43 <E1ephant>	what OS?
Sep 17 10:37:58 <E1ephant>	nslookup is asking the resolver you expect to answer?
Sep 17 10:38:16 <muAdmDev>	debian 9
Sep 17 10:39:09 <earendil>	does that use systemdumb
Sep 17 10:39:17 <earendil>	and networkmangler
Sep 17 10:39:26 <E1ephant>	lol
Sep 17 10:39:41 <muAdmDev>	E1ephant: yes, and as I said the returned IP is corerct. but the service then tries to connect to the old IP
Sep 17 10:39:44 <E1ephant>	systemd is here to stay, but yeah networkmangler can die in a fire
Sep 17 10:39:58 <E1ephant>	is your service misconfigured?
Sep 17 10:39:59 <muAdmDev>	earendil: :) yeah, already got some nice experiences with the "mangler"
Sep 17 10:40:17 <earendil>	i mean if it does use it, i'd say check that shit
Sep 17 10:40:32 <earendil>	E1ephant: don't care, lennart and systemdork can fuck off
Sep 17 10:40:35 <earendil>	there are alternatives
Sep 17 10:40:44 <muAdmDev>	I'll see what's up with the "Mangler"
Sep 17 10:40:53 <E1ephant>	earendil: life will be hard then :P
Sep 17 10:41:07 <E1ephant>	yeah you can dump mangler pretty easily ime
Sep 17 10:41:23 <E1ephant>	netplan is kinda okay
Sep 17 10:42:57 <muAdmDev>	no network manager running here
Sep 17 10:43:23 <E1ephant>	what is the service?
Sep 17 10:43:27 <earendil>	what does nslookup tell you
Sep 17 10:43:36 <E1ephant>	> muAdmDev | I moved a hostname to a different server and therefore IP address. nslookup got the current IP.
Sep 17 10:44:43 <earendil>	huh. how about arp table for the MAC
Sep 17 10:44:58 <muAdmDev>	E1ephant: the service tries to connect to a DB, unfortunately contacting the old IP address, not the updated one that's reported by nslookup
Sep 17 10:45:19 <earendil>	service? lol does it have a hardcoded addr? :D
Sep 17 10:45:33 <muAdmDev>	earendil: would make sense when resolvin MAC<->IP
Sep 17 10:46:17 <muAdmDev>	earendil: :D no, it's using the hostname. but the service resolves it to the old IP, even though nslookup return the new IP (both on the same system) - is something liek that even possible
Sep 17 10:47:14 <E1ephant>	yeah it just smells like it's hardcoded somewhere
Sep 17 10:47:22 <earendil>	or something's caching it
Sep 17 10:47:23 <E1ephant>	if it's not resolving correctly?
Sep 17 10:47:33 <alex23>	I have a network where everyone needs a password to sign in. I do have one. But i noticed that i could run nslookup with 8.8.8.8 dns and with this network's dns too. But ping and other things,dns is blocking the request. 127.0.0.53 is replying for nslookup and if i use nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8 is also giving me result. I donot know whats
Sep 17 10:47:33 <alex23>	happening without logging in. If i change my default dns 127.0.0.53 to something else, i think i dont even need netowork login. But i'm confused why is its giving me result of nslookup also with default dns.
Sep 17 10:47:34 <E1ephant>	does the "host" command return the correct value as well?
Sep 17 10:47:34 <earendil>	but hardcoded is the one i'd look for, if the OS checks out
Sep 17 10:49:45 <muAdmDev>	E1ephant: noted that, will check it with a test-hostname
Sep 17 10:54:05 <alex23>	I have a network where everyone needs a password to sign in. I do have one. But i noticed that i could run nslookup with 8.8.8.8 dns and with this network's dns too.

Sep 17 10:55:05 <djph>	because your machine is running a local DNS cache
Sep 17 10:58:12 <alex23>	djph I had the same thinking about local cache. So i nslookup a non popular website which i'm sure that it doesnot have its cache. Still it gave nslookup result
Sep 17 10:58:57 <alex23>	djph which means
Sep 17 11:11:13 <arrity42>	hi
Sep 17 11:12:07 <arrity42>	does anyone have any advice for scaling server sent events across multiple app servers? like if a user sends a chat message with POST, and you want to relay that message to subscribers
Sep 17 11:15:05 <Phil-Work>	arrity42, some sort of pub/sub mechanism
Sep 17 11:15:20 <Phil-Work>	there's plenty of pretty cheap "cloud" hosted solutions, which are a lot easier than rolling your own
Sep 17 11:15:38 <arrity42>	hmm like what?
Sep 17 11:16:04 <Phil-Work>	if you want to roll your own, something like NodeJS+Socket.io or SignalR would work
Sep 17 11:16:21 <arrity42>	oh ok yeah i've used socket io before
Sep 17 11:16:34 <arrity42>	hmm ok different question
Sep 17 11:17:14 <Phil-Work>	arrity42: https://gist.github.com/phil-lavin/5c949a63c02e0b3f1d234b9cdf6ed8b1
Sep 17 11:17:30 <Phil-Work>	there's a list someone at $dayJob put together in September 2017
Sep 17 11:17:46 <Phil-Work>	we went with pubnub.com, in the end - they're alright and pretty well priced
Sep 17 11:18:32 <arrity42>	ok so here's my situation. i want to have a user POST a message to an app server (it's then saved to the database). then i want the server to relay that message to all SSE (server sent events) subscribers, so that it instantly shows up for them without a refresh. is it possible to have my users connect to every backend server? such that regardless
Sep 17 11:18:33 <arrity42>	of which one they post the message to, that server will be able to relay it to everyone?
Sep 17 11:19:02 <Phil-Work>	arrity42, you could have them connect to every server but it scales badly
Sep 17 11:19:33 <Phil-Work>	you'd be better to either use a hosted service or some sort of message bus (e.g. RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ) to route the message to the right subscriber server
Sep 17 11:19:34 <arrity42>	really? it seems like it would be even more scaleable because it removes the need for something like redis
Sep 17 11:19:58 <arrity42>	they're still distributing all the GET and POST calls to different servers
Sep 17 11:20:16 <arrity42>	it's just that each server has a list of all the subscribers so that it doesn't need to hit redis first
Sep 17 11:20:27 <Phil-Work>	it scales badly because if you end up with a million subscribers and 100 servers, you've got 100 million connections to manage (and a single server won't handle more than ~65,000 connections on a single IP, anyway)
Sep 17 11:21:29 <arrity42>	hmm okay that's true
Sep 17 11:22:04 <arrity42>	i'm not sure what rabbitmq is. i understand redis and how that would be used here but not sure if rabbitmq would be better, but i've heard about it
Sep 17 11:22:20 <arrity42>	is it very similar to redis?
Sep 17 11:22:25 <Phil-Work>	no
Sep 17 11:22:41 <Phil-Work>	Rabbit is message bus - you publish messages to it and consume messages from it
Sep 17 11:22:58 <Phil-Work>	in its simplest form, it's a FIFO queue... but there's a lot more to it in terms of message routing and distribution
Sep 17 11:23:55 <Phil-Work>	it's a decent model as it avoids the need for service discovery - as long as everything knows where Rabbit is, everything doesn't need to know where everything else is... which makes scaling a lot eaiser
Sep 17 11:25:37 <arrity42>	ok reading it about it now thanks
Sep 17 11:27:01 <arrity42>	oh it's just a way to put a buffer between backend services
Sep 17 11:28:03 <Phil-Work>	pretty much, though as I said there's some nice stuff in it for routing messages creatively between services
Sep 17 11:28:13 <arrity42>	hmmmm.. is there no panacea? it's impossible to horizontally scale websockets/server-sent-events across multiple app independent servers without them first talking to a central authority?
Sep 17 11:28:29 <arrity42>	unsolved problem?
Sep 17 11:29:42 <Phil-Work>	well, it depends what you define as a "central authority"
Sep 17 11:30:13 <Phil-Work>	something needs to manage it, but there's various database technologies (e.g. Cassandra) which are entirely distributed and cannot really be described as centralised
Sep 17 11:31:13 <djph>	Phil-Work: I have one better -> just pay cloudflare :) bahhahaha
Sep 17 11:31:25 <djph>	... err, right, scrollback :|
Sep 17 11:32:22 <arrity42>	i just mean like.. let's say you're doing the most standard thing ever. a bunch of chat rooms, and you're using HTTP2 POST to send messages to a server. and server sent events (or websockets, w/e) to send messages back to everyone connected to a room
Sep 17 11:32:48 <arrity42>	with a single server this is easy. you can just have a hashmap of room ID that maps to an array of connections
Sep 17 11:33:04 <arrity42>	but to scale this across multiple servers, you need to introduce state, maybe in the form of redis
Sep 17 11:33:15 <arrity42>	is there no way to avoid needing redis/state?
Sep 17 11:33:57 <Kim^J>	Let every server tell other servers what happened.
Sep 17 11:34:02 <djph>	^
Sep 17 11:34:05 <Kim^J>	Look at how IRC networks work.
Sep 17 11:34:05 <djph>	wait...
Sep 17 11:34:14 <Kim^J>	There's no Redis or database invovled in that.
Sep 17 11:34:25 <arrity42>	hmmmmmmmmmmm. what do you think of that solution?
Sep 17 11:34:37 <arrity42>	also i don't know how irc works
Sep 17 11:34:45 <Kim^J>	arrity42: So learn how IRC works.
Sep 17 11:34:59 <arrity42>	well i could yes. is that how irc works though?
Sep 17 11:35:17 <E1ephant>	yeah like a one pager on IRC would provide a lot of insight
Sep 17 11:35:29 <E1ephant>	I would also second reading up there
Sep 17 11:35:46 <arrity42>	what does that mean? "second reading up there"? you mean you agree with the suggestion to learn how irc works?
Sep 17 11:35:49 <Kim^J>	arrity42: When you send a message to a channel, then you send that message to your server, that server then sends that message to all servers connected to that server, which in turn sends to additional servers and clients.
Sep 17 11:36:00 <E1ephant>	yes, I agree with the suggestions to read about IRC
Sep 17 11:36:02 <Kim^J>	So IRC messages gets spread across the network.
Sep 17 11:36:12 <arrity42>	ok i will do that later it sounds interesting. but i'm interested in terms of performance/scalability
Sep 17 11:36:15 <E1ephant>	it's very distributed by design
Sep 17 11:36:30 <Kim^J>	arrity42: That is performance and scalability.
Sep 17 11:36:32 <arrity42>	which would perform better generally? a redis server with pub/sub or this distributed design?
Sep 17 11:36:36 <E1ephant>	yeah literally from 1985
Sep 17 11:36:40 <djph>	arrity42: well, it's been working pretty well for 40 years
Sep 17 11:36:43 <E1ephant>	and still largely the same
Sep 17 11:36:57 <Kim^J>	arrity42: What do you expect the Redis server to add?
Sep 17 11:37:04 <E1ephant>	networks have held 100,000s of users
Sep 17 11:37:22 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Messages are bufferend on the server, so sent in bulk.
Sep 17 11:37:33 <Kim^J>	Which allows you to scale pretty decently.
Sep 17 11:37:38 <arrity42>	hmm interesting. i realllllly hate state so i am very interested in this idea and i would like to pursue it. i'm just worried that it might be inferior to a stateful pubsub mechanism like redis from a perf standpoint
Sep 17 11:38:05 <djph>	IRC performs pretty damn well...
Sep 17 11:38:31 <E1ephant>	yeah seems to be wokring here
Sep 17 11:38:31 <Kim^J>	arrity42: The very same idea is implemented on LMAX to poer their trading platform.
Sep 17 11:38:45 <Kim^J>	Which handles millions of messages per second.
Sep 17 11:39:02 <arrity42>	oh that's good to hear. ok so question then
Sep 17 11:39:15 <Kim^J>	Redis could only dream of that performance.
Sep 17 11:40:43 <arrity42>	so let's go back to the simple chatting example. where each server uses SSE and has a hashmap of roomIDs to an array of connections. you're saying that the user POSTs a message to an arbitrary backend server and then that server relays that message to everyone via SSE by looking up the room id and sending to all connected clients, and then it also
Sep 17 11:40:43 <arrity42>	does a POST request to all the other backend servers with the message and room ID and all those servers do the same thing? (look it up and send that message to everyone in that server's hashmap)?
Sep 17 11:40:50 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Don't choose what others choose on the premise that they are successful.
Sep 17 11:41:16 <Kim^J>	Yes
Sep 17 11:41:26 <arrity42>	that honestly sounds amazing. i love the stateless design
Sep 17 11:41:32 <arrity42>	if you all endorse it then i will pursue it
Sep 17 11:41:40 <Kim^J>	Welcome to networking 101... Broadcast... xD
Sep 17 11:41:45 <djph>	arrity42: yeah, more or less.  There's a bit of a safety of "it came from ..."
Sep 17 11:42:26 <arrity42>	what do you mean?
Sep 17 11:45:05 <djph>	well, can't have server[2..X] sending back to server1
Sep 17 11:45:14 <djph>	message would loop forever
Sep 17 11:45:53 <arrity42>	oh ok i see. i don't think that would happen in my case
Sep 17 11:46:52 <arrity42>	i guess the only remaining problem is how each server knows the address of all the other servers
Sep 17 11:47:04 <djph>	you tell them, duh
Sep 17 11:47:18 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Initial list of nodes
Sep 17 11:47:22 <Kim^J>	Is one way.
Sep 17 11:47:23 <djph>	or have them sign into a known upstream server
Sep 17 11:47:28 <arrity42>	yeah i guess i could just hardcode that in
Sep 17 11:47:37 <Kim^J>	Then you simply add a node to any existing node and that node tells all the other nodes
Sep 17 11:48:07 <arrity42>	i'm trying to avoid the need to have any other servers besides my app servers. like no central authority
Sep 17 11:48:15 <arrity42>	the user can just connect to any random backend. no load balancer even
Sep 17 11:48:29 <Kim^J>	Why no load balancer?
Sep 17 11:48:41 <arrity42>	i mean, what's the point? just connect to a random backend, no?
Sep 17 11:48:46 <arrity42>	law of large numbers would be enough i guess
Sep 17 11:49:02 <Kim^J>	arrity42: How do you get users to evenly select random nodes?
Sep 17 11:49:13 <djph>	Kim^J: I think he's thinking of it like in the 90s / early 00s -- if you connect to "servername.hisservice.com" it's a SINGLE machine.
Sep 17 11:49:24 <Kim^J>	djph: Probably.
Sep 17 11:49:28 <arrity42>	yeah that's what i meant by law of large numbers. each user when they connect to the app just rolls a random number between 1 and SERVER_COUNT and connects to that one
Sep 17 11:49:32 <Kim^J>	djph: That's one of the major flaws in IRC though.
Sep 17 11:49:43 <djph>	Kim^J: i never said it was perfect :)
Sep 17 11:49:50 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Why not use a load balancer?
Sep 17 11:50:04 <arrity42>	well i mean how is it better than just exploiting how random numbers work?
Sep 17 11:50:12 <arrity42>	avoids single point of failure
Sep 17 11:50:20 <Kim^J>	Heh!
Sep 17 11:50:22 <djph>	HA!
Sep 17 11:50:25 <Kim^J>	You need to up your game.
Sep 17 11:50:31 <arrity42>	?
Sep 17 11:50:31 <Kim^J>	Single point of failure... xD
Sep 17 11:50:42 <djph>	I mean, I love them, keeps me paid...
Sep 17 11:50:43 <Kim^J>	Do you *really* think that LBs are a signle box?
Sep 17 11:51:05 <arrity42>	i mean a lot of them are. i guess they don't have to be though
Sep 17 11:51:31 <Kim^J>	No LB setup worth mentioning consists of a single box.
Sep 17 11:51:38 <arrity42>	how do you avoid having a single point of failure though? a load balancer that load balances to other load balancers?
Sep 17 11:51:49 <arrity42>	you have to connect to something
Sep 17 11:51:51 <TandyUK>	you have (at least) a pair
Sep 17 11:51:52 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Failover
Sep 17 11:52:01 <Kim^J>	With floating IP
Sep 17 11:52:03 <Kim^J>	Is one way.
Sep 17 11:52:06 <arrity42>	so would the client use a random number to decide which load balancer to connect to?
Sep 17 11:52:14 <Kim^J>	No
Sep 17 11:52:21 <Kim^J>	You let network infrastructure handle that.
Sep 17 11:52:23 <djph>	Kim^J: I have many "single box" load-balancers at small businesses -- but that's more the "look, all that's around here is shitty 50/2.5 adsl"
Sep 17 11:52:47 <TandyUK>	no, your loadbalancers would each have an ip, eg 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5, then you setup a floating ip with carp/vrrp/etc such as 1.2.3.6, then that is the only ip your clients ever see
Sep 17 11:52:51 <Kim^J>	djph: Are they really load balancers though? More like proxy.
Sep 17 11:52:52 <arrity42>	so a floating ip means you can have a single ip address that can refer to multiple servers? and if one goes down it goes to the other one?
Sep 17 11:53:06 <Kim^J>	Yes
Sep 17 11:53:10 <arrity42>	ok but then isn't the service that provides THAT floating ip now your single point of failure? lol
Sep 17 11:53:17 <Kim^J>	No
Sep 17 11:53:17 <arrity42>	like i feel like eventually there has to be ONE THIN
Sep 17 11:53:19 <arrity42>	one thing*
Sep 17 11:53:22 <Kim^J>	Nah.
Sep 17 11:53:30 <TandyUK>	djph: i'd say theres a major difference between  a) load balancing a single site out over multiple connections, vs b) load balancing inbound connection requests to a pool of backend servers
Sep 17 11:53:35 <arrity42>	ok what if the service that provides the floating ip goes down?
Sep 17 11:53:48 <Kim^J>	There is no service providing that.
Sep 17 11:53:48 <TandyUK>	a) use a single box, noone would ever know or care anyway.. b) make damn sure its HA/redundant
Sep 17 11:54:10 <Kim^J>	arrity42: You simply let the LB box being active say "I now listen to this IP"
Sep 17 11:54:11 <djph>	Kim^J: yeah, they're balancing 2x DSL connections to at least let the 10 people in the office pretend they have a decent internet connection.
Sep 17 11:54:21 <Kim^J>	djph: Ah, that kind.
Sep 17 11:54:24 <djph>	TandyUK: shutup you :P
Sep 17 11:54:30 <TandyUK>	rofl
Sep 17 11:55:00 <arrity42>	hmmmmm i don't understand. i'll try and google how a floating ip works
Sep 17 11:55:14 <TandyUK>	arrity42: VRRP / CARP are worth reading about
Sep 17 11:55:32 <TandyUK>	or HSRP if your going for high speeds
Sep 17 11:55:36 <djph>	the 'one thing' usually amounts to your "disparate(tm)" ISPs sharing the same inter-city conduit that a backhoe just dug up.
Sep 17 11:55:42 <TandyUK>	(high = 10gbps+)
Sep 17 11:55:51 <Kim^J>	arrity42: https://ahmermansoor.blogspot.com/2018/08/keepalived-configure-floating-ip-centos-7.html
Sep 17 11:56:22 <arrity42>	i just don't understand. if you're configuring it on a centos then isn't that machine responsible for maintaining the existence of floating ip? like what if that machine goes down?
Sep 17 11:56:33 <Kim^J>	Then the other takes over.
Sep 17 11:56:37 <TandyUK>	arrity42: you have a PAIR of machines
Sep 17 11:56:57 <TandyUK>	you have 2 of everything
Sep 17 11:57:04 <arrity42>	can they be at different parts of the world?
Sep 17 11:57:13 <TandyUK>	2 nics, 2 switches, 2 routers, 2 machines,
Sep 17 11:57:24 <TandyUK>	no all of this would assume youre locating this 'node' on a single site
Sep 17 11:57:36 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Yes, but that requires a lot more in infrastructure.
Sep 17 11:57:41 <TandyUK>	but technically, yes it could be (more sensible would be 2 different buildings in the same complex of datacenters)
Sep 17 11:57:44 <Kim^J>	And is much much much slower.
Sep 17 11:58:07 <tds>	and also an awful lot more expensive, you'd need your own IP space to start
Sep 17 11:58:12 <Kim^J>	Not sure how fast BGP propagates.
Sep 17 11:58:14 <arrity42>	so basically each nic/switch/router/machine is checking pretty often if the other set is down and if they are then he takes over?
Sep 17 11:58:20 <Kim^J>	tds: Yeah... :D
Sep 17 11:58:32 <Kim^J>	arrity42: Only the LBs
Sep 17 11:58:32 <TandyUK>	yeah, 'pretty often' like every few milliseconds
Sep 17 11:58:44 <arrity42>	interesting ok that makes sense now
Sep 17 11:58:51 <Kim^J>	Switches and routers doesn't work the same way.
Sep 17 11:59:20 <arrity42>	how does cloudflare mitigate ddos attacks?
Sep 17 11:59:43 <Kim^J>	Caching, caching, caching and more caching.
Sep 17 11:59:47 <arrity42>	like let's say you have an app server and it's getting ddosed. someone just spamming your api
Sep 17 12:00:00 <arrity42>	i heard cloudflare can help mitigate that. what do you they do for you though? do they just proxy your traffic?
Sep 17 12:00:15 <Kim^J>	arrity42: They serve a cached site when your site doesn't answer.
Sep 17 12:00:18 <arrity42>	how do they know which is legitimate traffic to forward to your app vs the traffic of the ddoser?
Sep 17 12:00:18 <TandyUK>	you rate limit requests at the LB, so that your real app server is only dealing with actual requests
Sep 17 12:00:25 <Kim^J>	And they have *SHITLOADS* of copies of your site.
Sep 17 12:00:39 <TandyUK>	you can quite easily tell usually
Sep 17 12:00:47 <arrity42>	how do you tell what is real traffic?
Sep 17 12:00:59 <Kim^J>	TandyUK: Totally depends on the request though.
Sep 17 12:01:00 <TandyUK>	analyse it, and compare with known real traffic
Sep 17 12:01:03 <arrity42>	only thing i can really think of is disallow from china or something
Sep 17 12:01:09 <arrity42>	what else can you do?
Sep 17 12:01:27 <TandyUK>	yeah agreed, the hard stuff to protect is public api endpoints that are just 1 request to get a load of data back
Sep 17 12:01:31 <Kim^J>	Packet inspection, compare patterns, apply some "machine learning" / "AI"
Sep 17 12:01:42 <arrity42>	yeah tandy that is what i have and i'm not sure what to do to stop someoen from spamming me
Sep 17 12:01:48 <arrity42>	othe rthan use a leaky bucket or something
Sep 17 12:02:19 <arrity42>	kim ok if i inspect the packet i don't know what i'm looking for? like what if the packet is just GET api/v1/get_people ?
Sep 17 12:02:28 <arrity42>	that is the same as everyone else so not sure what im inspecting
Sep 17 12:02:43 <Kim^J>	For that case, throw more hardware at the problem.
Sep 17 12:03:02 <arrity42>	so the only way to solve ddos for an api is to get more hardware or to use a leaky bucket algo?
Sep 17 12:03:06 <TandyUK>	how many requests have you seen from that ip i nthe past X seconds/minutes/hours,  what usually comes after that request, is client following the expected pattern?
Sep 17 12:03:09 <tds>	cloudflare run a full http proxy so they can see the contents of the requests, not just raw tls, for example
Sep 17 12:03:13 <TandyUK>	all sorts of ways to identify dodgy traffic
Sep 17 12:03:24 <Kim^J>	Rate limiting on IP, on credentials, etc.
Sep 17 12:03:25 <arrity42>	oh thats what u mean by machine learning
Sep 17 12:03:29 <Kim^J>	That helps
Sep 17 12:03:38 <arrity42>	to see if the requests are "logical"
Sep 17 12:03:40 <arrity42>	or weird
Sep 17 12:03:52 <arrity42>	i dont understand how to rate limit on ip
Sep 17 12:03:54 <arrity42>	like i understand it
Sep 17 12:03:59 <arrity42>	but what if many peopel share an ip?
Sep 17 12:04:01 <arrity42>	are they just fucked?
Sep 17 12:04:05 <TandyUK>	yeah, you expect to see request a, request b, then either c or d
Sep 17 12:04:05 <Kim^J>	arrity42: They are fucked.
Sep 17 12:04:08 <arrity42>	hmmm
Sep 17 12:04:17 <arrity42>	how often is that? not enough to care about?
Sep 17 12:04:18 <TandyUK>	if a client just keeps spamming request b, why are they doing that?
Sep 17 12:04:23 <arrity42>	im not sure if i should rate limit by ip or account
Sep 17 12:04:28 <arrity42>	what is better?
Sep 17 12:04:32 <Kim^J>	arrity42: With CGNAT, it can happen quite often tbh.
Sep 17 12:04:40 <Kim^J>	Both
Sep 17 12:04:45 <TandyUK>	rate limit by ip might be "20 requests per minute", or "1000 requests per 15m"
Sep 17 12:04:48 <tds>	if you require authentication, account sounds sensible
Sep 17 12:04:54 <Kim^J>	tds: Need both.
Sep 17 12:04:59 <tds>	but you might want to IP limit the authentication endpoint ;)
Sep 17 12:05:12 <Kim^J>	Lunch!
Sep 17 12:05:18 <arrity42>	well making an account on my site takes like 5 seconds so im not sure if rate limiting by account would do anything.. but rate limiting by ip could make certain innocents unable to use the site.. not sure what to do
Sep 17 12:05:44 <TandyUK>	then set the limits high enough to not catch lusers
Sep 17 12:05:58 <arrity42>	what is that word
Sep 17 12:06:06 <TandyUK>	if a reasonable level of requests would be 100 requests per customer per hour, set the limit to 200 or something
Sep 17 12:06:30 <TandyUK>	a spammer trying to ddos you is going o hit you with that perm inute
Sep 17 12:06:35 <arrity42>	do u agree that it is pointless to rate limit by account if registering an account takes <10 seconds?
Sep 17 12:06:41 <arrity42>	and only to do ip?
Sep 17 12:06:56 <TandyUK>	id be limiting how many accounts an ip can create in a set period, eg 2 accounts per hour or something
Sep 17 12:07:10 <TandyUK>	unless theres some valid reason why someone might need more than that?
Sep 17 12:07:14 <arrity42>	but what about that cgnap thing u mentioned earlier
Sep 17 12:07:22 <tds>	or stick a captcha on account registration
Sep 17 12:07:29 <TandyUK>	work out what that 'reasonable limit' is, then increase it a little to cater for CGNAT
Sep 17 12:07:54 <arrity42>	i wish i knew how common CGNAT was. like how innocents are reasonably likely to be afflicted?
Sep 17 12:07:56 <TandyUK>	CGNAT = what most mobile phone companies use... 1 public ip, but they NAT maybe 1000 customers behind it
Sep 17 12:08:02 <TandyUK>	VERY common
Sep 17 12:08:11 <arrity42>	ok for a site like google or stackoverflow or something
Sep 17 12:08:20 <arrity42>	what percent of people are sharing an ip with many other people?
Sep 17 12:08:32 <arrity42>	such that rate limiting by ip will ruin their experience?
Sep 17 12:08:33 <TandyUK>	BUT, you can also download ip lists of know CGNAT endpoints for example, so youd set a different limit for those blocks of ips vs 'rest of the world'
Sep 17 12:08:41 <arrity42>	oh that is an idea
Sep 17 12:08:44 <arrity42>	interesting
Sep 17 12:09:01 <tds>	does anyone actually publish such lists?
Sep 17 12:09:13 <TandyUK>	yeah im sure theres lists
Sep 17 12:09:15 *	xand screws up face
Sep 17 12:09:21 <TandyUK>	id be incredibly surprised if there isnt tbfh
Sep 17 12:09:28 <xand>	list of incompetent ISPs
Sep 17 12:09:33 <TandyUK>	lol right
Sep 17 12:09:53 <TandyUK>	you can also identify quite a lot by AS too
Sep 17 12:10:28 <arrity42>	so if cgnat is so common then how do popular services like stackoverflow/google/facebook rate limit then? liek if ur rate limiter is 100 requests per 5 min then if u have 1000 people on the same ip all using the service then no one can use it..
Sep 17 12:10:37 <TandyUK>	vodafone for example has a different ASN for mobile broadband users vs 'the rest of their network'
Sep 17 12:10:45 <tds>	eh, I don't really mind cgnat as long as providers deploy v6 at the same time
Sep 17 12:10:46 <xand>	100 requests per 5 minutes? wtf
Sep 17 12:10:54 <tds>	it's a fact of life at this point, v4 be expensive
Sep 17 12:10:58 <arrity42>	just an example dont worry about the number
Sep 17 12:10:58 <xand>	tds: sure, if that were the case...
Sep 17 12:11:34 <tds>	if doing v4-only with cgnat then fine to call them incompetent ;)
Sep 17 12:12:26 <cyberjunkie>	Anyone here use Traefik
Sep 17 12:17:40 <dminuoso>	I have a switch whose mstpd regularly kicks a switchport between blocking and learning mode for one particular interface. Other than receiving BPDUs via that interface, is there a conceivable reason why the mstpd might do this?
Sep 17 12:20:03 <BtbN>	Wonky cable is out of the question?
Sep 17 12:20:56 <dminuoso>	BtbN: Yes.
Sep 17 12:21:07 <dminuoso>	BtbN: And emphasis: It's the mstpd doing this.
Sep 17 12:22:41 <dminuoso>	(So its unlikely that its a wonky cable. We'd rather get Rx errors in that case, but dBm looks fine)
Sep 17 12:25:31 <natten>	Anyone got any suggestions why this request just sits there until it times out when running from google cloud function but not from local?

Sep 17 12:26:45 <Wasim>	Hello Everyone. I wanted to know what are the steps involved in mapping a domain to a different host. For example, my current domain example.com is mapped to a server somewhere in the USA. I want to map it onto a server in England. However, I don't want my hierarchy to be affected. Hence, I am cloning the USA Server onto the UK server and map the d
Sep 17 12:26:46 <Wasim>	omain example.com to it. Will it effect the functions of my website?
Sep 17 12:28:04 <grawity>	well,if both servers do exactly the same thing (same webserver, same website files, etc.) then it won't
Sep 17 12:29:15 <TandyUK>	Wasim: what do you mean by "I don't want my hierarchy to be affected"
Sep 17 12:29:24 <TandyUK>	basically copy shit, and update the A record
Sep 17 12:29:27 <Kim^J>	Google pagerank?
Sep 17 12:30:09 <TandyUK>	manually verify everything is working on the new host by using one workstation with a modified hosts file to force that one machine to access the new server before you edit the dns
Sep 17 12:30:37 <TandyUK>	or, pay your hosting provider to manage the migration for you, then sue them if they screw up
Sep 17 12:31:15 <TandyUK>	unless the screw up is becuase you didnt tell them about something ofc, in which case you dont have a leg to stand on
Sep 17 12:31:56 <Wasim>	By heirarchy I mean, there is a file on USA Server with the URL example.com/landingpage1, I want to create a file on the UK server with the same name ''landingpage1''. So when i map the domain to the server, my website is the same without any downtime
Sep 17 12:32:32 <Kim^J>	Wasim: Is this Wordpress?
Sep 17 12:33:08 <Wasim>	Actually its a server used by one of our Marketing automation tool, "Marketo''.
Sep 17 12:33:33 <Kim^J>	Is it a VM?
Sep 17 12:33:39 <detha>	Wasim: does that have a local database behind it?
Sep 17 12:33:55 <mgolisch>	probably hard if its not a static site
Sep 17 12:34:19 <Kim^J>	In that case, turn off, snapshot, export snapshot, import snapshot in new DC, start new VM, point domain to new IP.
Sep 17 12:34:22 <Kim^J>	Boom! Done!
Sep 17 12:35:04 <detha>	Kim^J: minus requests hitting old server because cached DNS.
Sep 17 12:35:27 <Kim^J>	detha: Yeah, but who cares about that.
Sep 17 12:35:32 <detha>	So 1) bring TTL down 2) migrate server 3) change dns
Sep 17 12:35:36 <Kim^J>	Just schedule downtime when most convenient.
Sep 17 12:35:57 <Wasim>	I don't have the option for downtime. We are using the URLs in a lot of stuff and if the URL returns 404, we are out of luck. everything goes haywire.
Sep 17 12:36:52 <Wasim>	I am a non technical guy with a degree in economics stuck in this technical project, so I don't know a lot of jargon. :P
Sep 17 12:37:03 <detha>	People have been known to put GRE tunnels in place for that. But that is rather overkill, 5 minutes downtime generally costs a lot less
Sep 17 12:37:08 <Kim^J>	Wasim: There's always options for downtime.
Sep 17 12:37:28 <tds>	if you're non-technical and there's no option for downtime, you're probably doing it wrong ;)
Sep 17 12:37:52 <Kim^J>	Also, single server with no allowed downtime... xD
Sep 17 12:38:15 <E1ephant>	u/buf13
Sep 17 12:38:17 <detha>	Wonder if/when it was last updated
Sep 17 12:39:24 <Wasim>	My network guy told me he would map the domain to the new server and while it is mapping, the domain would point to the old server and then it would point to the new after 24 hours. i doubt its veracity that is why i am here :P
Sep 17 12:39:28 <mgolisch>	detha: never?
Sep 17 12:39:48 <Kim^J>	Wasim: That's basically how DNS works.
Sep 17 12:40:05 <Kim^J>	24h depends on TTL, but 24h is a safe bet for most ISPs.
Sep 17 12:40:21 <Kim^J>	Some ISPs doesn't respect TTLs
Sep 17 12:40:58 <Wasim>	so will there be down time where my domain example.com/landingpage returns nothing or server down error?
Sep 17 12:41:24 <Wasim>	during or immediately after the 24hours period?
Sep 17 12:41:27 <detha>	Depends of you keep the old server running
Sep 17 12:41:31 <Kim^J>	Wasim: Depending on the application, yes.
Sep 17 12:41:56 <detha>	If you keep it running, it will show something, but you will lose anything that goes to backend database
Sep 17 12:42:00 <tds>	if you change the dns record from one working server to another working server, no - but you'll end up with two servers with entirely inconsistent state between them for that 24h period
Sep 17 12:43:57 <Wasim>	The network guy said to basically clone the old server onto the new one. He dumbed it down for me and said to create the same files in the new server as the old.
Sep 17 12:44:43 <Wasim>	what is meant by ''entirely inconsistent state''? The old server would be up and running.
Sep 17 12:45:43 <tds>	some users will still connect to the old one, others to the new one - so if it stores any state in its local database, the servers will become inconsistent
Sep 17 12:45:59 <tds>	if they're just serving static content, you're fine, but it sounds like this is running some rather complex application
Sep 17 12:46:20 <Wasim>	just html pages and images
Sep 17 12:47:21 <detha>	If it is just static, keep the old server running until you've drained all traffic off it, 24-48 hours probably, and you're fine
Sep 17 12:48:33 <Wasim>	how do i know if my server is static or dynamic?
Sep 17 12:49:07 <detha>	Does it have a database? Do you pull reports on what hits the server?
Sep 17 12:50:20 <Wasim>	if someone visits a landing page on our server, we track their activity. (which page the visited etc).
Sep 17 12:51:37 <Kim^J>	Then it stores state.
Sep 17 12:51:52 <Kim^J>	Then it's not feasable to keep two instances running at the same time.
Sep 17 12:52:01 <Kim^J>	So you need to suck it up, there's gonna be downtime.
Sep 17 12:52:06 <Kim^J>	Next time, design better.
Sep 17 13:36:22 <TJ->	Wasim:  or... VPN between old and new servers, configure old server to connect to new server's database until old server gets no more requests, then drop remote DB link.
Sep 17 13:39:30 <aleph->	Stupid question, changing reverse dns for a host won't affect connectivity to it will it? Haven't noticed any issues on the two canary host I tested on before a prod rollout.
Sep 17 13:47:19 <Kim^J>	TJ-: That rarely works well, especially across the globe.
Sep 17 13:51:03 <xand>	aleph-: it wouldn't affect active connections, but services that rely on DNS lookups when connecting could be affected
Sep 17 13:53:28 <aleph->	Hmm, how so?
Sep 17 14:44:13 <giaco>	oh dear, I've been spending hours in setting up a self signed CA certificated chain but I am encoutering some strange problems.
Sep 17 14:45:19 <giaco>	I have server configured with (cert -> intermediate -> root) + cert-key, openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -CAfile chain.pem returns OK
Sep 17 14:45:44 <giaco>	so apparently my setup seems ok from openssl point of view
Sep 17 14:46:01 <giaco>	BUT: firefox connecting on the same port is presented a different cert
Sep 17 14:51:20 <grawity>	are you connecting specifically to https://127.0.0.1?
Sep 17 15:04:11 *	ChanServ gives voice to sep
Sep 17 15:19:54 <scrote>	hello.
Sep 17 15:20:23 <scrote>	I'm looking for a passive, uni directional networking tap for gigabit ethernet.
Sep 17 15:20:34 <scrote>	unidirectional meaning, can't transmit out of monitor port.
Sep 17 15:21:16 <Phil-Work>	scrote, on copper?
Sep 17 15:21:31 <scrote>	yea
Sep 17 15:22:05 <scrote>	everything on amazon is junk.  what do you guys recomend.
Sep 17 15:22:41 <SpiritHorse>	there is no such thing as a passive gigabit ethernet tap
Sep 17 15:22:53 <SpiritHorse>	100baseT, sure
Sep 17 15:22:53 <scrote>	why not?
Sep 17 15:23:36 <pppingme>	because gig uses all pairs for both tx and rx
Sep 17 15:23:49 <pppingme>	100/ use one pair for tx, one pair for rx
Sep 17 15:23:56 <scrote>	ok
Sep 17 15:24:07 <pppingme>	so you can't just "tap and listen" to the tx pair
Sep 17 15:24:12 <scrote>	well I'll drop the connecion down to 100mbp if I have to.
Sep 17 15:24:36 <pppingme>	find a mirroring switch, most have the ability to "not listen" to the mirrored port
Sep 17 15:24:40 <scrote>	what's a true passive 100 tap
Sep 17 15:24:51 <scrote>	like a span port?
Sep 17 15:24:59 <Habbie>	span ports are active
Sep 17 15:25:52 <scrote>	I bet cisco has mirror ports at fast speeds. right?
Sep 17 15:26:03 <scrote>	err has switches with mirror ports at fast speeeds.
Sep 17 15:26:10 <Habbie>	i bet
Sep 17 15:27:05 <scrote>	what do you mean that a span port is active.  doesn't that do mirroring>
Sep 17 15:27:36 <grawity>	define what you meant by 'passive'
Sep 17 15:27:53 <scrote>	grawity: as in can't transmit out of monitor port.
Sep 17 15:28:04 <scrote>	i.e. accidental dhcp requests, broadcasts, etc
Sep 17 15:28:09 <scrote>	pings, etc
Sep 17 15:28:15 <grawity>	that's a different kind than what I usually see described as 'passive' but ok
Sep 17 15:28:30 <scrote>	I want my IDS to be invisable to the network.
Sep 17 15:28:31 <grawity>	yes, span/mirror ports are passive in this sense
Sep 17 15:28:45 <SpiritHorse>	scrote: none of that should happen because the sniffing interface should have no IP
Sep 17 15:28:57 <scrote>	even datalink layer arp stuff?
Sep 17 15:29:25 <scrote>	are there no datalink layer vulns in the kernel?
Sep 17 15:29:33 <grawity>	SpiritHorse: that doesn't always prevent it from talking IP, though
Sep 17 15:30:15 <SpiritHorse>	very easy fix
Sep 17 15:30:18 <xand>	switch's mirror ports are meant to be "readonly"
Sep 17 15:30:37 <SpiritHorse>	and that
Sep 17 15:30:42 <scrote>	ok sweet.
Sep 17 15:30:55 <grawity>	I think mirror ports end up being read-only at hardware level
Sep 17 15:31:06 <scrote>	I always thought that copying of frames takes a toll on the switches performance.
Sep 17 15:31:58 <grawity>	while configuring e.g. a Linux box to never send / respond to anything is a game of sysctl whack-a-mole
Sep 17 15:34:09 <SpiritHorse>	it's a game of removing IP, null MAC, and a egress packet filter
Sep 17 15:34:20 <SpiritHorse>	done.
Sep 17 15:34:54 <SpiritHorse>	but like it's already been mentioned, a swtich port in monitor mode isn't going to forward ingress
Sep 17 15:34:59 <tds>	and then realise you bought a fancy new nic that sends lldp for you ;)
Sep 17 15:35:31 <SpiritHorse>	if you have a card that does LLDP you know about it, and presumably know how to deal with it
Sep 17 15:36:15 <SpiritHorse>	people rolling around with Intel X7x aren't caught off guard by LLDP, heh.
Sep 17 15:36:57 <Sout>	also while i have never used them, i saw they do advertise on wireshark (take that what you will) https://www.dualcomm.com/collections/network-tap has network taps
Sep 17 15:47:35 <shangtsung>	any of you have good/bad experiences with arista switches? in particular their 10gig switches? specficially the DCS-7124S-R?
Sep 17 15:50:18 <SpiritHorse>	If you can eat your food while everybody else is losing theirs and blaming you, you straight, hemi.
Sep 17 15:51:02 <SpiritHorse>	shangtsung: hmm we use Arista but hemi, that switch is like a decade old mang
Sep 17 15:51:32 <SpiritHorse>	we used them, no problems, not sure if you can get EOS updates for them still or not
Sep 17 15:57:49 <E1ephant>	shangtsung: beats the shit out of cisco
Sep 17 18:40:46 <ne2k>	weird problem. I was running openvpn as nobody:nogroup, but needed to extend it to learn-address into dnsmasq hosts file and sighup dnsmasq. I created a user openvpn and run openvpn as openvpn:nogroup, then run script under sudo from openvpn. script runs fine, but the line where it does kill -HUP fails with permission denied when run by openvpn
Sep 17 18:41:09 <ne2k>	but it works fine if I do sudo -u openvpn -g nogroup sudo /path/to/learn-address.sh params...
Sep 17 18:41:33 <ne2k>	this is linux in an lxc container, by the way.
Sep 17 18:45:43 <ne2k>	the only difference I can see in the sudo logs is the PWD (which I can't see making a difference as I've used absolute paths for everything) and whether TTY=something real (interactive; working) and TTY=unknown (from openvpn, not working)
Sep 17 18:45:49 <ne2k>	any clues?
Sep 17 18:46:06 <tatertots>	sounds like to found your own solution
Sep 17 18:46:16 <ne2k>	tatertots, how's that, then
Sep 17 18:46:27 <tatertots>	sounds like you found your own solution
Sep 17 18:46:29 <tatertots>	it works fine if I do sudo -u openvpn -g nogroup sudo /path/to/learn-address.sh
Sep 17 18:46:38 <tatertots>	then just do that
Sep 17 18:46:55 <dminuoso>	So Im sniffing a peer link between two switches. In ipv4 there's an awful lot of dup acks and retransmissions going on, while ipv6 is working perfectly fine. What could be possibly causing this?
Sep 17 18:48:13 <ne2k>	tatertots, um... that is interactive. I need it to work when openvpn runs the script
Sep 17 18:50:50 <tatertots>	ne2k: are you logged in as openvpn user right now?...can you switch to that user and display the group membership of user openvpn?...if not i'm sure you'll get it working eventually
Sep 17 18:51:03 <ne2k>	tatertots, the openvpn user cannot log in
Sep 17 18:51:35 <ne2k>	openvpn is in one group only, namely openvpn
Sep 17 18:51:56 <tatertots>	ne2k: so you want a user that is NOT a member of the "sudo" group to sudo?
Sep 17 18:52:20 <tatertots>	also known as sudoers group
Sep 17 18:52:35 <ne2k>	tatertots, yes, by putting a line openvpn	ALL=NOPASSWD: /etc/openvpn/learn-address.sh in the sudoers file
Sep 17 18:53:10 <ne2k>	as I said, it works, the script is able to edit the hosts file as required, but it cannot run kill for some reason
Sep 17 18:54:11 <tatertots>	ne2k: i'd make sure it would conceptually without scripting before i put it in a script
Sep 17 18:54:54 <ne2k>	this is a fairly regular thing to do; I'm trying to adapt this recipe to my needs https://superuser.com/questions/1326106/enable-dns-hostname-resolution-with-openvpn-and-dnsmasq/1382777#1382777
Sep 17 18:55:47 <ne2k>	tatertots, I'm really not sure what you're getting at. openvpn has a hook called learn-address which it calls when a client comes online or goes offline, to allow you to do things like modify firewall fules, or this (adding host to dns server).
Sep 17 18:55:58 <ne2k>	it has to be a script
Sep 17 18:56:49 <tatertots>	use a user account with the required elevation and or privileges
Sep 17 18:56:59 <tatertots>	script or no script
Sep 17 18:57:26 <ne2k>	tatertots, how would I allow a user account to sighup dnsmasq but not kill other processes it doesn't own, then
Sep 17 18:59:22 <tatertots>	I just tested my sudoers could run "kill" ...they could run kill successfully
Sep 17 18:59:43 <tatertots>	maybe look over your configuration to make sure you didn't typo or make a simple error
Sep 17 19:00:12 <ne2k>	tatertots, I think you're missing the point here. it works if I run it interactively. it works in all respect /apart from/ the kill line if it's run from by openvpn
Sep 17 19:01:12 <ne2k>	Syzolin, no
Sep 17 19:01:24 <ne2k>	you can talk to me in the channel if you wish
Sep 17 19:02:01 <ne2k>	I'm also wondering if it might be some interaction with flock
Sep 17 19:02:03 <tds>	ne2k: if you just drop an `id` into the script have you confirmed it's running as root properly?
Sep 17 19:02:26 <tds>	oh, though i suppose it must be if you've got sudo logs showing it
Sep 17 19:02:36 <ne2k>	tds, sudo doesn't log the group. I'll try that
Sep 17 19:04:04 <longxia>	ne2k: does kill indicate succes after it is run in your script? If so, you could run strace on the process to be killed to see if the signal arrives at all.
Sep 17 19:04:56 <ne2k>	longxia, well, dnsmasq doesn't reload it's hosts file, and I get kill (5008) : Operation not permitted in journalctl -f
Sep 17 19:05:55 <ne2k>	I'm trying to see if this could somehow be something to do with the fact that this is running in an lxc container
Sep 17 19:06:48 <ne2k>	tds, uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Sep 17 19:07:44 <ne2k>	tds,  CGroup: /system.slice/dnsmasq.service could this be relevant? I don't really get cgroups
Sep 17 19:07:48 <longxia>	ne2k: haven't much experience with lxc, but is seems likely
Sep 17 19:07:56 <longxia>	s/is/it/
Sep 17 19:08:30 <ne2k>	systemd[1]: openvpn.service: Failed to reset devices.list: Operation not permitted # this also seems worrying
Sep 17 19:08:56 <tds>	are you using openvpn.service or openvpn-server@.service?
Sep 17 19:09:11 <tds>	openvpn-server has a bunch of extra restrictions, I wonder if those could be causing issues
Sep 17 19:10:22 <tds>	ahhh yes
Sep 17 19:10:26 <ne2k>	tds, no, it's openvpn.service
Sep 17 19:10:38 <tds>	I think you may need to add CAP_KILL to the service's CapabilityBoundingSet, at a bit of a guess
Sep 17 19:10:48 <ne2k>	although... hang on, it doesn't seem to do anything
Sep 17 19:10:58 <ne2k>	execstart=/bin/true
Sep 17 19:10:59 <ne2k>	wtf
Sep 17 19:12:03 <ne2k>	there appears to be a openvpn@server.service, but I have no idea how this is configured
Sep 17 19:12:04 <tds>	it's just a master service for all the others I think, eg they have PartOf=openvpn.service
Sep 17 19:12:43 <tds>	openvpn@.service is deprecated iirc, you probably want one of openvpn-server or openvpn-client - but I think I'd try tweaking the capability bounding stuff on it
Sep 17 19:13:21 <ne2k>	tds, thing is, the script really is being run as root. sudo is working. so why, if it's root, can't it do whatever the hell it likes?
Sep 17 19:14:45 <ne2k>	find /etc/systemd -name '*openvpn*' returns only /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openvpn.service
Sep 17 19:14:57 <ne2k>	so how the hell is that @ service being started at all? tds
Sep 17 19:15:14 <tds>	er, hmm
Sep 17 19:15:17 <tds>	I suspect because of the PartOf
Sep 17 19:17:05 <ne2k>	tds grep -R openvpn /etc/systemd/* returns only that file too
Sep 17 19:17:15 <ne2k>	and that file doesn't contain PartOf
Sep 17 19:23:29 <mawk>	it's maybe not in /etc ne2k
Sep 17 19:24:39 <tds>	was just discussing it with ne2k, I think it's down to the openvpn-generator they wrote for backwards compatibility
Sep 17 19:24:53 <mawk>	openvpn.service is nothing
Sep 17 19:24:57 <mawk>	it's a fake service
Sep 17 19:25:02 <tds>	yeah
Sep 17 19:25:12 <mawk>	you want an instance of the client template or the server template
Sep 17 19:25:31 <tds>	this is the legacy mess under openvpn@.service
Sep 17 19:26:08 <mawk>	yeah
Sep 17 19:27:01 <mawk>	I don't know why there is both openvpn-server@.service and openvpn@.service
Sep 17 19:27:03 <mawk>	sounds suspicious
Sep 17 19:27:21 <tds>	openvpn@.service is legacy and deprecated
Sep 17 19:27:22 <tds>	(yay)
Sep 17 19:27:23 <mawk>	ah
Sep 17 19:27:24 <mawk>	I see
Sep 17 19:27:49 <mawk>	so, yeah, add CAP_KILL to the bounding set, but that's required only if openvpn tries to kill something that's not started by the openvpn user
Sep 17 19:27:54 <tds>	and the generator parses the old /etc/default/openvpn to add openvpn@foo.service units that depend on openvpn.service so your old setup all starts on boot properly
Sep 17 19:27:54 <mawk>	and that shouldn't really happen
Sep 17 19:28:07 <mawk>	ah I see
Sep 17 19:31:37 <bn_work>	does netstat display IPv6 addresses correctly?  Since IPv6 = 128-bits (64 network + 64 host), what does it mean when some IPv6 addresses only show 3 colons?  ie:  `tcp6       0      0 :::80                 :::*                    LISTEN`  I've parsing this as "public interface bound on port 80" (in this ex), but I'm wondering if I've been misreading this?
Sep 17 19:31:52 <bn_work>	s/bound/bound and listening/
Sep 17 19:32:00 <ne2k>	mawk, tds, I've put CapabilityBoundSet=CAP_KILL into an override for the service, and it's working, the dnsmasq is logging that it's re-reading its hosts file. AWESOME
Sep 17 19:32:05 <tds>	:)
Sep 17 19:32:40 <tds>	bn_work: that looks like bound to 80 on ::, but what does ss say?
Sep 17 19:32:45 <ne2k>	is there a nicer way to achieve this than running the script with sudo and running openvpn as a user who can sudo that script without a password? like by making dnsmasq and openvpn run as the same group or something?
Sep 17 19:32:57 <tds>	i'd expect more sensible output like [::]:80
Sep 17 19:33:10 <bn_work>	Also, who's "brilliant" idea was it to *not* to use dotted decimal #s when reading this stuff, makes it harder to read/pronounce? lol
Sep 17 19:34:02 <grawity>	oh yeah, imagine writing 2001:4860:4860::8844 as 32.1.72.96.72.96.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.136.68
Sep 17 19:34:32 <grawity>	actually I think that *was* the proposed syntax in more than one "IPng" spec
Sep 17 19:35:46 <bn_work>	tds:  ss shows the same syntax output, ie: :::80
Sep 17 19:36:01 <ne2k>	tds, thank you so much for your help, you really are a lifesaver. do you have a beer fund I can contribute to?
Sep 17 19:36:08 <tds>	interesting, with what args? my desktop's definitely printing [::]:80
Sep 17 19:36:33 <tds>	ne2k: i don't drink, all good ;)
Sep 17 19:38:25 <tds>	oh that is fun, I get ::: on a stretch box and [::]: on a buster one
Sep 17 19:38:42 <bn_work>	grawity:  you selected an easy example VS something unpronounceable hex-mix of values, + I meant just clustering them in decimals double-octet decimals not octet.octet.octet...octet
Sep 17 19:39:14 <grawity>	honestly I'd prefer 200148604860.8844 like in the zerotier blog or wherever it was
Sep 17 19:39:16 <bn_work>	tds:  ss -lpn
Sep 17 19:39:40 <bn_work>	tds:  even that is unclear to me
Sep 17 19:40:07 <tds>	fwiw, :: is the v6 equivalent of 0.0.0.0, if that helps?
Sep 17 19:40:52 <bn_work>	tds:  I think so... so basically bound on all (non-loopback) interfaces?
Sep 17 19:41:29 <grawity>	all (including loopback) interfaces
Sep 17 19:41:47 <grawity>	yes, [::] includes [::1] and 0.0.0.0 includes 127.0.0.1
Sep 17 19:41:58 <bn_work>	tds:  the choice of ":" as the IPv6 separator just seems like asking for confusion, especially since people like to leave out :s sometimes
Sep 17 19:42:04 <bn_work>	granted port usually is last... but stil
Sep 17 19:42:10 <bn_work>	still
Sep 17 19:42:15 <tds>	also keep in mind it might cover v4 addresses as well
Sep 17 19:42:29 <tds>	depending on if the v6only flag is set, ss with -e will tell you that
Sep 17 19:45:22 <bn_work>	s/something/some/;s/decimals double-octet/double-octet/;
Sep 17 19:46:08 <bn_work>	blah, not able to focus :|
Sep 17 19:46:24 <bn_work>	tds, grawity, thanks for the clarification
Sep 17 20:02:34 *	ChanServ gives voice to catphish
Sep 17 20:12:21 <phantomcircuit>	is there anyway to generate the ht_capab and vht_capab lines from the output of iw ?

Sep 17 22:45:12 <TandyUK>	Xionaba: id also recommend looking into a) restricting what can access your pi's by ip (eg, f you have 3 buildings all with static ips, that you want to remotely access from each other, only allow those 3 ips to get through the firewall) b) if you really must open something up to the world, put it behind put it behind some simple password protection, and run something like fail2ban to
Sep 17 22:45:12 <TandyUK>	catch and then ban drive by snoopers. Also consider using per country block/allow lists, and only allow relevant regions (eg you might want to access from a mobile phone, but from a us provider.. only allow those then, or even find out your providers own ranges)
Sep 17 22:45:44 <TandyUK>	that chunk is just security best practice really, and more network relevant than the fact its a rpi being accessed
Sep 17 22:46:53 <TandyUK>	if you want to do even better, you could look at setting up site-to-site vpns, and not exposing anything publicly at all
Sep 17 22:47:41 <TandyUK>	little (or nothing) would need doing on the rpi's then, assuming you 'trust' what is on the lan's of the different sites (and +1 for limiting what can pass over the vpn to what you actually want too)
Sep 17 22:48:30 <catphish>	picked up my new bike last night :) https://imgur.com/a/8SmVHRB
Sep 17 22:49:20 <Xionaba>	TandyUK: thanks, advanced doing all those things manually, but  the process will be fun, i think
Sep 17 22:50:04 <TandyUK>	Xionaba: not really, the basic rule is allow as little as possible, block everything else
Sep 17 22:50:13 <TandyUK>	and not really much fun either im afraid lol
Sep 17 22:50:26 <TandyUK>	catphish: shiny, I hope it stays that way :)
Sep 17 22:50:34 <catphish>	TandyUK: me too!
Sep 17 22:50:49 <catphish>	my last one lasted me 7 years, until it died of old age
Sep 17 22:51:06 <catphish>	rather hoping for a similar run of good luck
