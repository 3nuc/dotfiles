Aug 31 13:21:42 <kezimo>	I found a previously unknown piece of malware masquerading as Windows Defender with forged encryption certificates on an install of Windows Server
Aug 31 13:22:05 <kezimo>	no known signatures either
Aug 31 13:38:45 <tomreyn>	kezimo: did you post it to virustotal.com?
Aug 31 13:41:51 <kezimo>	yes
Aug 31 13:42:35 <kezimo>	someone check the filesize of mpcmdrun.exe for me and the exact name of the signer
Aug 31 13:43:43 <kezimo>	Autoruns is reporting the Microsoft certificate is invalid and when I look at the cert info it says "Microsoft Windows Publisher" not "Microsoft Corporation". My reference info says the file should be under 200k but this one is almost half a meg.
Aug 31 13:45:14 <kezimo>	I probably wasn't compromised. Additional fear. The endless never ending terror. Until my face is stuck in a state of shock for days at a time once it starts to let up
Aug 31 13:45:18 <kezimo>	jaw agape
Aug 31 13:45:33 <kezimo>	Shock and Awe.
Aug 31 13:45:46 <kezimo>	awesome. I thought I just had a funny face more shit to deal with
Aug 31 13:45:50 <kezimo>	check that fucking file for me
Aug 31 13:45:59 <kezimo>	idgaf about any of that
Aug 31 13:49:50 <kezimo>	either way I need to redo this server install anyway
Aug 31 13:55:20 <SymbioticFemale>	is there a "screen" / "screen -r" for ssh -X applications?
Aug 31 13:56:35 <iz>	SymbioticFemale: maybe try ctrl-z
Aug 31 13:56:57 <iz>	and then reconnect the ssh before you do fg again
Aug 31 14:00:15 <rudi_s>	SymbioticFemale: xpra
Aug 31 14:01:24 <SymbioticFemale>	rudi_s: thanks rudi_s
Aug 31 14:02:42 <rudi_s>	np - it's not perfect but works much better than ssh -X
Aug 31 16:39:41 <sl4ck>	hi all. Does anyone know any work around the Kazakhstan gov case, where they are trying to download their gov cert in order to control, surveil or/and censor the internet
Aug 31 16:40:24 <sl4ck>	I mean Chrome is keep popping up to install a gov cert
Aug 31 16:44:28 <en4rab>	i think both chrome and firefox specifically distrust that cert now
Aug 31 16:46:07 <vavkamil>	sl4ck, you are from kazakhstan?
Aug 31 16:46:30 <sl4ck>	no
Aug 31 16:47:37 <vavkamil>	if you try to visit website that uses the "kazach" root cert with chrome/firefox, it will show an error and won't let you in
Aug 31 16:47:40 <sl4ck>	en4rab: but if we dont accept that cert we'll not be able to access internet, right?
Aug 31 16:47:51 <sl4ck>	right
Aug 31 16:48:04 <vavkamil>	yeach I suppose it will break a lot of things
Aug 31 16:48:35 <sl4ck>	what would be the work around to this matter?
Aug 31 16:48:56 <vavkamil>	hard to say, as DNS over HTTPS might not work either
Aug 31 16:49:57 <vavkamil>	one of my colleague is from kazakhstan and she was super angry about this
Aug 31 16:50:52 <sl4ck>	what about vpn, proxies?
Aug 31 16:51:13 <vavkamil>	but last I head it was only a "temporary" test and it's not fully enrolled yet
Aug 31 16:51:46 <vavkamil>	I suppose ISP can report you for using VPN or even deny a service for you
Aug 31 16:51:47 <sl4ck>	well, will not take too long to fully implement it
Aug 31 16:52:57 <vavkamil>	for example in my country we have national blacklist for casino websites and all you need to do is change the DNS
Aug 31 16:53:25 <sl4ck>	change you DNS in your conf file?
Aug 31 16:53:52 <vavkamil>	yeah DNS addresses from ISP are provided by ISP, just change it to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8
Aug 31 16:53:59 <vavkamil>	*DHCP
Aug 31 16:54:41 <sl4ck>	oh. this matter becomes more and more stupid
Aug 31 16:54:50 <sl4ck>	i don't know why they want to do that
Aug 31 16:56:28 <vavkamil>	I read a post from iranian developer recently and he was so fucked
Aug 31 16:56:46 <sl4ck>	why?
Aug 31 16:57:23 <vavkamil>	github is blocked because open source is bad :D
Aug 31 16:58:04 <vavkamil>	sl4ck, https://medium.com/@hamed/github-blocked-my-account-and-they-think-im-developing-nuclear-weapons-e7e1fe62cb74
Aug 31 17:01:18 <vavkamil>	if you are born in Iran and interested in IT, you are so fucked, it's such a nonsense really
Aug 31 17:03:47 <sl4ck>	yeah, true
Aug 31 17:05:47 <calmclam>	Now imagine instead of losing access to github you lost access to imported food
Aug 31 17:07:20 <vavkamil>	I'm not sure how my life depends on imported food
Aug 31 17:31:27 <katsumi>	hmmm
Aug 31 17:32:52 <katsumi>	it's hot and here's a fckn fly that nervs me
Aug 31 17:33:45 <katsumi>	while watchin football
Aug 31 17:34:34 <at0m>	katsumi: fly is easy. i always win.
Aug 31 17:34:44 <at0m>	football otoh..
Aug 31 17:34:53 *	katsumi sends at0m a bear
Aug 31 17:34:58 <katsumi>	oom sry
Aug 31 17:35:16 *	katsumi offers at0m a beer
Aug 31 17:35:24 <katsumi>	so besser
Aug 31 17:35:28 *	at0m pours the beer into the bear
Aug 31 17:35:29 <at0m>	all set
Aug 31 17:35:35 <katsumi>	hrhrhr
Aug 31 17:36:08 <calmclam>	bear with me
Aug 31 17:36:10 <katsumi>	give him som mjot instead
Aug 31 17:38:27 <NGC3982>	hi. if i was to use software (windows software from within a business vm) to connect to a partner, is using winscp a problem?
Aug 31 17:38:47 <NGC3982>	i have always seen it as a good tool for myself, but i have no idea how business enviroments do it
Aug 31 17:39:39 <at0m>	NGC3982: my company shivers at the thought of SSH. cos bi-directional port-forwarding and ssh tunnels, i imagine.
Aug 31 17:39:54 <katsumi>	i used it for years, but ngc3982... isn't it an anterprise serialnumber from startrek``?
Aug 31 17:39:57 <NGC3982>	is ssh not seen as secure enough?
Aug 31 17:39:58 <at0m>	well, for regular employees at least
Aug 31 17:40:25 <at0m>	NGC3982: oh it's very secure. but also means you can tunnel into the company and make it seem you're on the LAN
Aug 31 17:40:28 <NGC3982>	katsumi: no, i am a galaxy 64Mly away.
Aug 31 17:40:58 <katsumi>	aaaaaah
Aug 31 17:41:17 <NGC3982>	at0m: i see. well, the sftp connection itself is approved from our it-sec, so im not really trying to question the connection itself. but, im on the vm and need to choose a tool to use the sftp.
Aug 31 17:41:24 <NGC3982>	and there is where my question arises
Aug 31 17:41:56 <at0m>	katsumi: NGC is the "new" galatic catalog, after messier catalog (say M31, Andromeda)
Aug 31 17:42:09 <NGC3982>	that is not true
Aug 31 17:42:15 <at0m>	NGC3982: ah ok then. yea winscp or putty has an scp client, too
Aug 31 17:42:27 <NGC3982>	ngc is some random letters douglas adams came up with after he postulated that 42 was the meaning of everything
Aug 31 17:42:37 <katsumi>	hhrhrhr
Aug 31 17:42:46 <at0m>	NGC3982: that, too. if you say so.
Aug 31 17:42:55 <NGC3982>	at0m: so, the tool itself is not a big of a security question as with using sftp (ssh) in the first place?
Aug 31 17:43:01 <katsumi>	but build a key and store instead of using a password
Aug 31 17:43:09 <NGC3982>	yes, i thought so too
Aug 31 17:43:31 <at0m>	NGC3982: right, i think those tools are all using same libs, and yea use key auth, not pass
Aug 31 17:43:56 <NGC3982>	and passphrase without a password i guess
Aug 31 17:44:01 <NGC3982>	i think thats already setup
Aug 31 17:44:21 <NGC3982>	passphrase key without a password i guess*
Aug 31 17:44:48 <katsumi>	as far as libgcrypt is not used ... *hust*
Aug 31 17:44:50 <at0m>	better. even better, key with pass
Aug 31 17:45:08 <flyback>	20G
Aug 31 17:45:28 <NGC3982>	i guess a key with passphrase + password doesnt hurt
Aug 31 17:45:28 <flyback>	1950KB in errors 1486 # of errrors
Aug 31 17:45:29 <flyback>	not bad
Aug 31 17:45:37 <flyback>	and it's shrinking
Aug 31 17:45:48 <at0m>	flyback: lemme guess. ddrescue
Aug 31 17:45:51 <wr>	NGC3982, question is what you wanna connect
Aug 31 17:45:54 <flyback>	yep
Aug 31 17:46:00 <at0m>	\o/
Aug 31 17:46:17 <flyback>	started on one of the origional disks
Aug 31 17:46:35 <flyback>	before I just been eliminating most of the disks I think just ended up in the pile when I moved
Aug 31 17:47:21 <flyback>	funny now I didn't know how shitty this model hd was
Aug 31 17:47:27 <katsumi>	sometimes its better to eleminate things
Aug 31 17:47:27 <flyback>	back then
Aug 31 17:47:32 <flyback>	surprised it lasted as long as it did
Aug 31 17:47:55 <at0m>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States#/media/File:Munitions_T-shirt_(front).jpg
Aug 31 17:49:26 <flyback>	katsumi, yeah im done to two boxes now
Aug 31 17:49:40 <flyback>	but I decided to switch up and do one of the origionals
Aug 31 17:49:51 <flyback>	done/down
Aug 31 17:51:06 <NGC3982>	wr: to a single pre-determined partner's sftp server.
Aug 31 17:51:12 <flyback>	i'd abort ddrescue now and just live with whatever is missing in the 1950KB but I think it's on the mft
Aug 31 17:53:02 <wr>	NGC3982, ah, anything that works on ftp should do it then, ssh, filezilla etc
Aug 31 17:53:13 <NGC3982>	i see
Aug 31 17:53:21 <NGC3982>	i thought the kind of sftp tool was important
Aug 31 17:53:33 <katsumi>	i was puttin 5 boxes and send these using a spaceship into the next black hole. i'm waiting taht they will release again.
Aug 31 17:53:40 <NGC3982>	but as long as i have the right way of connecting (keys, passphrases, and so on) it doesnt really matter?
Aug 31 17:54:13 <flyback>	it's amazing how much info you can get out of a pagefile too
Aug 31 17:54:15 <wr>	NGC3982, there are differences, but most should work unless you have any special virtualization or network setup
Aug 31 17:54:21 <NGC3982>	i see
Aug 31 17:54:29 <NGC3982>	thank you guys
Aug 31 17:54:37 <flyback>	you are welcome
Aug 31 17:54:40 <flyback>	unless you are canadian
Aug 31 17:54:46 <flyback>	;P
Aug 31 17:54:54 <NGC3982>	who wouldnt welcome a canadian
Aug 31 17:54:59 <flyback>	I wouldn't
Aug 31 17:55:03 <flyback>	BMCC
Aug 31 17:55:11 <flyback>	BITE MY "CANUCK"...........................................CANUCK!
Aug 31 17:55:21 <NGC3982>	relax eh
Aug 31 17:55:24 <flyback>	:P
Aug 31 17:55:26 <katsumi>	ohh.... flyback not that canuck canuck
Aug 31 17:55:36 <katsumi>	lol
Aug 31 17:56:08 <flyback>	seriously though I must have used ddrescue 100's of times by now at work
Aug 31 17:56:11 <flyback>	and it still shocks me
Aug 31 17:56:11 <ullbeking>	i am considering buying a fully libre hardware + firmware security device for openpgp-related email security
Aug 31 17:56:34 <ullbeking>	i want to learn if there is a methodology to auditing hardware and firmware?
Aug 31 17:56:46 <flyback>	yeah
Aug 31 17:56:52 <flyback>	a) kidnap the coder
Aug 31 17:56:57 <flyback>	b) secret location
Aug 31 17:56:58 <ullbeking>	or if it is just one of those things you "know" by being a (hopefully) a good engineer?
Aug 31 17:57:03 <flyback>	c) brass knuckles
Aug 31 17:57:07 <ullbeking>	i sense the latter
Aug 31 17:57:23 <ullbeking>	ok, thanks your help flyback !
Aug 31 17:57:27 <ullbeking>	c ya later
Aug 31 17:57:32 <flyback>	well that nsa tool is supposted to be good
Aug 31 17:57:37 <flyback>	ghia or whatever it's called
Aug 31 17:57:52 <flyback>	for decompiling firmware etc
Aug 31 17:58:12 <flyback>	also binwalk
Aug 31 17:58:22 <flyback>	for identifiying parts of an image
Aug 31 17:59:47 <mawk>	"here, just take this screwdriver, now you can build a home"
Aug 31 18:00:43 <flyback>	eh?
Aug 31 18:00:46 <flyback>	that's all I know
Aug 31 18:03:47 <flyback>	im not blowing him off
Aug 31 18:03:51 <katsumi>	flyback: canado or germany what would you prefer? i can't give you a green card but may be you wanna marry me? lol
Aug 31 18:03:57 <flyback>	that's as much info as I have to contribute

Aug 31 18:16:26 <sophiee>	https://github.com/jollheef/lpe
Aug 31 18:16:48 <sophiee>	lpe is a collection of verified Linux kernel exploits.
Aug 31 18:16:48 <sophiee>	Exploit testing is fully automated. Feel free to make a pull request with a new exploit to see it by yourself 😉
Aug 31 18:16:51 <sophiee>	The end goal is to collect all public exploits that actually work.

Aug 31 18:22:53 <dognosewhiskers>	Question: Is it 100% impossible to "use double proxies" so that I connect from MyPC => Proxy1 => Proxy2 => DestinationSite, if those proxies don't have some sort of special, private API/interface to enable this?
Aug 31 18:27:38 <flyback>	ugh
Aug 31 18:27:40 <flyback>	:/
Aug 31 18:29:01 <flyback>	some of our various vendor backup sw's are ubuntu based and it seems like they never update anything
Aug 31 18:29:05 <flyback>	well the newer ones do thank God
Aug 31 18:29:13 <flyback>	but some of them you have to wonder how much they got rooted
Aug 31 18:29:24 <flyback>	espically when I saw dictionary attacks on ssh logs
Aug 31 18:29:29 <flyback>	bill smith
Aug 31 18:29:33 <flyback>	bill something
Aug 31 18:29:35 <flyback>	bill thomas
Aug 31 18:29:35 <flyback>	etc
Aug 31 18:30:32 <flyback>	im glad we don't use datto's solution anymore
Aug 31 18:30:42 <flyback>	they were running a kernel that has a known oops in zfs
Aug 31 18:30:46 <flyback>	which is what they use to store data
Aug 31 18:30:51 <flyback>	wtfbbq
Aug 31 18:31:39 <flyback>	course my favorite was replibit, now they are way better under new ownership so it's a good product now
Aug 31 18:31:43 <flyback>	but we had a few crash
Aug 31 18:31:47 <flyback>	because the / filled with
Aug 31 18:32:01 <flyback>	and in there would be a monodb log 20gig+ or
Aug 31 18:32:04 <flyback>	MONODB STARTING
Aug 31 18:32:08 <flyback>	MONODB STOPPING
Aug 31 18:32:13 <flyback>	<flyback> MONODB STARTING
Aug 31 18:32:14 <flyback>	<flyback> MONODB STOPPING
Aug 31 18:32:17 <flyback>	OVER AND OVER
Aug 31 18:58:41 *	katsumi will enjoy an icecolded beer now! cheers!!!!!!1
Aug 31 18:58:55 <calmclam>	watch out for the bear
Aug 31 19:01:16 <katsumi>	knock knock i want my honey MOW!!!
Aug 31 19:01:20 <katsumi>	;)
Aug 31 19:05:00 <mawk>	you're all alcoholics
Aug 31 19:05:06 <mawk>	first flyback, now katsumi
Aug 31 19:06:20 <flyback>	me?
Aug 31 19:06:24 <mawk>	yes
Aug 31 19:06:24 <flyback>	never drank in my life
Aug 31 19:06:28 <mawk>	really ?
Aug 31 19:06:29 <flyback>	yes
Aug 31 19:06:43 <flyback>	no drugs either
Aug 31 19:06:49 <mawk>	but sometimes you start to speak german and you can't type straight
Aug 31 19:06:54 <flyback>	still get hangovers every moroning and lost my teeth
Aug 31 19:06:59 <flyback>	just tired and burned out
Aug 31 19:07:02 <flyback>	I get floaty
Aug 31 19:07:07 <calmclam>	he doesn't "drink", he prefers to imbibe the other way, gets you sloshed faster
Aug 31 19:07:17 <flyback>	OH BMCC
Aug 31 19:07:25 <mawk>	with vodka tampons ?
Aug 31 19:07:32 <flyback>	I was tempted though more than once the pain up my ass was so bad
Aug 31 19:07:40 <kokokon>	flyback can you repost this link with a mode vulns?
Aug 31 19:07:52 <kokokon>	if there is a pain in the ass it needs a cream
Aug 31 19:07:55 <flyback>	mode vulns?
Aug 31 19:08:06 <kokokon>	printers vulns
Aug 31 19:08:14 <flyback>	kokokon, no yrs of IBS has damaged the nerves in my backside
Aug 31 19:08:18 <flyback>	it's just chronic
Aug 31 19:08:28 <flyback>	when you shit acid that causes you to leap off the toilet into the shower
Aug 31 19:08:30 <flyback>	it's bad
Aug 31 19:08:45 <kokokon>	well there is a fix
Aug 31 19:08:45 <flyback>	hang on
Aug 31 19:08:48 <flyback>	lemme find it agai

Aug 31 19:09:20 <flyback>	and because many routers and pritners use this
Aug 31 19:09:25 <flyback>	they are vunerable
Aug 31 19:09:56 <kokokon>	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530131
Aug 31 19:10:09 <kokokon>	do you have money to buy vitamin b12 in bulk?
Aug 31 19:10:21 <flyback>	heh
Aug 31 19:10:28 <flyback>	it's not that simple but thx :)
Aug 31 19:10:53 <flyback>	lemme try to find you some vxworks examples
Aug 31 19:11:07 <kokokon>	yes occam razor

Aug 31 19:12:07 <flyback>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks
Aug 31 19:12:47 <kokokon>	coool
Aug 31 19:13:13 <mawk>	you can program a linux kernel like it is vxworks
Aug 31 19:13:16 <mawk>	using xenomai
Aug 31 19:13:56 <flyback>	what's hilarious is
Aug 31 19:14:12 <flyback>	we were exploiting the shit out of vxworks 19 yrs ago
Aug 31 19:14:16 <flyback>	and they still have some of the same shit
Aug 31 19:14:20 <mawk>	yeah
Aug 31 19:14:20 <kokokon>	hehe
Aug 31 19:14:29 <mawk>	audience of vxworks is very limited
Aug 31 19:14:35 <kokokon>	its a law of entropy :)
Aug 31 19:14:38 <mawk>	sloppy programming goes undetected
Aug 31 19:14:40 <kokokon>	people IQ decay
Aug 31 19:14:47 <flyback>	mawk no they used it on a lot of cheap routers
Aug 31 19:14:58 <flyback>	cause they could save some mb of ram and flash vs linux
Aug 31 19:15:07 <flyback>	but yeah they just slapped them together
Aug 31 19:15:12 <mawk>	yeah but I mean the dev audience is limited
Aug 31 19:15:17 <flyback>	oh yeah
Aug 31 19:15:19 <mawk>	I know it's present everywhere, but it's not audited
Aug 31 19:15:27 <flyback>	it's actually not bad for some stuff
Aug 31 19:15:30 <mawk>	I used FreeRTOS, not vxworks
Aug 31 19:15:34 <flyback>	in terms of a reliable os for embedded
Aug 31 19:15:41 <flyback>	but their network stack needs redone
Aug 31 19:15:45 <mawk>	yeah
Aug 31 19:16:15 <flyback>	i've looked at freertos a few times for some msp430's and 8051's
Aug 31 19:16:26 <flyback>	I want to take a old cd or dvd drive
Aug 31 19:16:37 <flyback>	one of the ones that used a real 40mhz 805x and has a rom socket
Aug 31 19:16:43 <flyback>	and run a os on it just for laughs
Aug 31 19:16:47 <mawk>	nice
Aug 31 19:16:59 <kokokon>	old 8088 pc would be fun on lubuntu
Aug 31 19:17:04 <kokokon>	would it work? :P
Aug 31 19:17:09 <flyback>	no but there is elks
Aug 31 19:17:17 <flyback>	I am sorry I destoyed my 286 trying to add ram to the board
Aug 31 19:17:23 <flyback>	would have been nice to run elks on it
Aug 31 19:17:28 <kokokon>	what is elks?
Aug 31 19:17:30 <mawk>	you can run linux on very small things kokokon
Aug 31 19:17:38 <mawk>	but you have no fork() call or stuff like this that need a MMU
Aug 31 19:17:40 <flyback>	elks is real mode linux
Aug 31 19:17:41 <mawk>	so you can forget ubuntu
Aug 31 19:17:43 <flyback>	for 808x
Aug 31 19:17:50 <flyback>	I think they might do a 286 protected mode also
Aug 31 19:18:08 <flyback>	there is linux for devices that don't have a mmu
Aug 31 19:18:12 <flyback>	but they won't run on 808x still
Aug 31 19:18:16 <mawk>	ah
Aug 31 19:18:24 <kokokon>	Vintage Tandy 1000 HX Computer intel 8088 256k RAM 720k Floppy - FULLY WORKING
Aug 31 19:18:30 <kokokon>	mmmmm
Aug 31 19:18:31 <flyback>	nice
Aug 31 19:18:34 <kokokon>	360 usd :D
Aug 31 19:18:38 <flyback>	swap the floppy drive for a emulator
Aug 31 19:18:55 <flyback>	someone made a card that lets you use 16 bit ide drives with 8 bit 808x pc's
Aug 31 19:18:58 <flyback>	has a open source bios
Aug 31 19:19:07 <flyback>	they also have a serial mode for that bios
Aug 31 19:19:11 <flyback>	you can emulate a hd using a pc
Aug 31 19:19:15 <flyback>	to feed the 808x
Aug 31 19:19:29 <flyback>	xtidebios
Aug 31 19:19:50 <flyback>	http://www.xtideuniversalbios.org/
Aug 31 19:22:10 <kokokon>	what is search engine can be co hosted?
Aug 31 19:22:14 <kokokon>	on blockchain
Aug 31 19:22:27 <kokokon>	something like google yet decentralised
Aug 31 19:22:32 <kokokon>	what if
Aug 31 19:23:19 <kokokon>	peer distributed search engine
Aug 31 19:23:50 <flyback>	there's a lot of things I would put up with
Aug 31 19:23:53 <flyback>	legacy pc wise
Aug 31 19:23:56 <flyback>	for the nostalgia
Aug 31 19:23:59 <kokokon>	yee
Aug 31 19:24:00 <flyback>	floppies are not one of them
Aug 31 19:24:04 <flyback>	so I will be using a hw emualtor
Aug 31 19:24:05 <kokokon>	floppies are fun
Aug 31 19:24:44 <kokokon>	well, they are fun for me cause  I feel I am inserting something into a hole :)  and feel leet
Aug 31 19:25:27 <kokokon>	we no longer can post letters, rarely use drill, no floppies, cards are contactless
Aug 31 19:25:45 <flyback>	oh you might like this
Aug 31 19:25:52 <flyback>	I have 100 old floppies I have to pull data form
Aug 31 19:25:56 <kokokon>	ooooo
Aug 31 19:26:02 <flyback>	many of them don't even get detected as floppies anymore :(
Aug 31 19:26:04 <flyback>	so going to use this
Aug 31 19:26:22 <flyback>	http://cowlark.com/fluxengine/index.html
Aug 31 19:26:24 <flyback>	$20 to make
Aug 31 19:26:40 <flyback>	bypases the pc's stupid floppy controller
Aug 31 19:26:40 <kokokon>	haha awesome
Aug 31 19:26:52 <flyback>	does direct sampling of the digital bitstream from the drive
Aug 31 19:27:05 <kokokon>	can I buy old floppies and restore data on them?
Aug 31 19:27:06 <flyback>	so it can handle oddball formats, fake bad sector copy protection or disks with a canuckload of damage
Aug 31 19:27:12 <kokokon>	would be fun :)
Aug 31 19:27:20 <flyback>	mabye if the signal is still intact enough
Aug 31 19:28:07 <kokokon>	btw I am renting new apartment, left tomato for a 2 days already one that had a hole are moldy
Aug 31 19:28:22 <kokokon>	this is not normal, how they moldy so fast
Aug 31 19:29:18 <kokokon>	also how do I select which IP range to scan for printers and such?
Aug 31 19:29:23 <kokokon>	internet is vast
Aug 31 19:30:18 <flyback>	no idea sorry
Aug 31 19:30:44 <flyback>	,mabye find a database of spamming printers people already found
Aug 31 19:30:54 <kokokon>	Shodan
Aug 31 19:31:02 <kokokon>	whoever made it is a bitch
Aug 31 19:31:12 <kokokon>	:)
Aug 31 19:32:56 <weijunli>	how can i know android Activity arguments? Im trying to do it with drozer
Aug 31 19:33:38 <kokokon>	cause now more vuln will be patched :P
Aug 31 19:33:49 <kokokon>	yet entropy will do it work too :)
Aug 31 19:33:57 <kokokon>	and outsourcing
Aug 31 19:39:12 <flyback>	hmm
Aug 31 19:39:57 <flyback>	I still have to come up with a way to checksum validate two hard drive raw images, one from each data recovery box, to guard against data corruptiopn caused by ide/sata incompatibilities etc
Aug 31 19:40:03 <flyback>	easy to do when the hd images clean
Aug 31 19:40:15 <flyback>	when you have one like the one I am doing now with ddrescue and it's full of holes
Aug 31 19:40:28 <flyback>	one more sector imaged on one machine than the other, the checksum will fail
Aug 31 19:41:07 <flyback>	someoen suggested diff and just go by % of identical
Aug 31 19:41:17 <flyback>	if they are high identical then the images are probably both good
Aug 31 19:41:37 <kokokon>	would you say presence of girls helps to code more?
Aug 31 19:41:45 <kokokon>	or it is distracting
Aug 31 19:41:46 <flyback>	I don't code
Aug 31 19:41:55 <flyback>	want to learn how for embedded but not got to that yet
Aug 31 19:43:40 <kokokon>	there is a crow
Aug 31 19:43:47 <kokokon>	she is making noice
Aug 31 19:44:00 <kokokon>	do you think its a warning or ?
Aug 31 19:44:11 <FungiFox>	it sounds like an audio target.
Aug 31 19:44:13 <FungiFox>	PULL
Aug 31 19:44:17 <mawk>	or mating call
Aug 31 19:44:39 <FungiFox>	crows only say one thing "shoot in my direction you pussy"
Aug 31 19:45:08 <kokokon>	they can see evil
Aug 31 19:45:11 <kokokon>	and more
Aug 31 19:45:18 <FungiFox>	crows are bad.
Aug 31 19:45:26 <FungiFox>	bad to have em around
Aug 31 19:45:29 <mawk>	crows are smart
Aug 31 19:45:34 <mawk>	which is the opposite of bad
Aug 31 19:45:45 <FungiFox>	hitler was smart.
Aug 31 19:45:57 <kokokon>	he still is smart
Aug 31 19:46:15 <FungiFox>	intelligence is a tool... it doesn't have morality. super smart people can be bad, forest gump can be good.
Aug 31 19:46:34 <FungiFox>	i think he is the only good person... ever... once... even that one time.
Aug 31 19:46:59 <FungiFox>	rest of us suck for the most part, we want to be good... and generally try to be.. but none of us can compare with forest gump.
Aug 31 19:47:07 <kokokon>	Hitler did same as Napoleon
Aug 31 19:47:25 <FungiFox>	yeah, hitlers mistake was doing it when we had camera equipment.
Aug 31 19:47:32 <FungiFox>	fail
Aug 31 19:47:52 <kokokon>	trump is a hitler too
Aug 31 19:48:01 <FungiFox>	not even close.
Aug 31 19:48:10 <FungiFox>	well.. what is "a hitler"
Aug 31 19:48:13 <kokokon>	well you right
Aug 31 19:48:14 <FungiFox>	define that.
Aug 31 19:48:43 <FungiFox>	did hitler drink water just as trump drinks water? must be the exact same person!
Aug 31 19:48:52 <kokokon>	hitler an individual from a poor, middle class backround . very smart and very high level sex gf
Aug 31 19:49:30 <kokokon>	trump is from very wealthy family that makes his emotionally poorer
Aug 31 19:49:38 <FungiFox>	i just want to say before we continue, im on the high of making $850 in the last 30 minutes from a lucky win.
Aug 31 19:49:46 <kokokon>	nice
Aug 31 19:49:54 <kokokon>	do we have a rain bot? :P
Aug 31 19:50:04 <FungiFox>	every weekend this family comes over and sells off his grandpas estate, i bought a shit ton of legit silver.

Aug 31 19:51:14 <FungiFox>	lol, 3 lbs of 92.5% silverware for $40.
Aug 31 19:51:31 <kokokon>	so you are a crow
Aug 31 19:51:36 <kokokon>	:P
Aug 31 19:51:40 <FungiFox>	no, they are crows... im a vulture.
Aug 31 19:51:54 <FungiFox>	im dumb, they are the instigators.
Aug 31 19:52:45 <FungiFox>	they know exactly what it is.. i bought 700-1400 worth of jewelry off them a few weekends ago when they came up for $100
Aug 31 19:52:55 <kokokon>	whyy
Aug 31 19:52:56 <FungiFox>	i felt bad, told them that this aint garage sale stuff.
Aug 31 19:53:07 <kokokon>	they can easily sell it in town
Aug 31 19:53:13 <FungiFox>	too much to get rid of.... i told them to call a liquidator.
Aug 31 19:53:28 <FungiFox>	they would charge them 30-50%, but they would get legit pricing on each item.
Aug 31 19:53:36 <kokokon>	why dont you hire truck and find more
Aug 31 19:53:42 <kokokon>	you can make millions
Aug 31 19:53:50 <kokokon>	is this in america?
Aug 31 19:54:13 <FungiFox>	cause i work a 9-5, got a business on the side and im not a garage sale hunter... this one gold mine just happens to be around the block in my small town.
Aug 31 19:55:04 <FungiFox>	i bought 3 sets of NFL cards, 1991, 1992, 1993 for $1. brand new mint condition.
Aug 31 19:55:54 <FungiFox>	literally owned them for less than 30 minutes, one of the nephews has a birthday today and came over and i surprised him with them. i had a 1991 set that was opened years and years ago and i been surprising him with a handful of cards.
Aug 31 19:56:12 <FungiFox>	now he got 3 sets, brand new.

Aug 31 20:02:18 <kokokon>	:P
Aug 31 20:02:41 <kokokon>	In fact, I actually installed a malware on the 18+ vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this website to experience fun

Aug 31 20:14:12 <vavkamil>	we had a client that fell for this, paid the ransom three times, every time it was way higher :D
Aug 31 20:14:26 <katsumi>	ask fungi

Aug 31 20:15:03 <vavkamil>	kokokon, well that was the case
Aug 31 20:15:05 <katsumi>	:)
Aug 31 20:15:45 <vavkamil>	they basically told him that the first payment took so long, so they shared the video of him jerking with other hackers that wanted the payment too
Aug 31 20:16:05 <kokokon>	lol did they had an actual video?
Aug 31 20:16:10 <vavkamil>	no
Aug 31 20:16:31 <kokokon>	bravo
Aug 31 20:16:35 <wilsonfisk>	I've never been asked by another hacker (let alone anyone really) if I wanted to watch a video of a random jerking for extortion purposes
Aug 31 20:16:36 <vavkamil>	but he paid them again and after that he contacted us for help, we basically told him to forget about it and he paid us for the advice too
Aug 31 20:16:39 <wilsonfisk>	you have weird friends
Aug 31 20:16:50 <kokokon>	vavkamil lolol
Aug 31 20:17:16 <kokokon>	yes fake bs emails is da way to money

Aug 31 20:17:44 <kokokon>	wilsonfisk you think average payout is low?
Aug 31 20:17:46 <wilsonfisk>	ransomware/fileless malware is what's hot in the streets
Aug 31 20:17:57 <kokokon>	fileless?
Aug 31 20:18:13 <vavkamil>	spam nation by krebs is kinda good book about this kind of stuff, but I found it boring
Aug 31 20:18:15 <kokokon>	well if there is no video and amount is low most people will not even complain
Aug 31 20:18:31 <kokokon>	if you spread ransomware many will complain
Aug 31 20:19:22 <wilsonfisk>	.wik fileless_malware
Aug 31 20:19:35 <wilsonfisk>	emmy must still be collecting her shit
Aug 31 20:20:29 <katsumi>	noemmyether

Aug 31 20:20:57 *	kokokon cries
Aug 31 20:21:20 <wilsonfisk>	she's in other channels so she's alive
Aug 31 20:21:21 <wasamasa>	what shit did you make her collect
Aug 31 20:21:40 <kokokon>	he pimped her
Aug 31 20:21:42 <wilsonfisk>	math stuff, very complicated, very secret
Aug 31 20:21:48 <kokokon>	to some old algo
Aug 31 20:21:52 <katsumi>	she got banned from ##math
Aug 31 20:22:59 <kokokon>	let's have spam mail competition?
Aug 31 20:23:12 <kokokon>	divide some list and see who gets more btc
Aug 31 20:23:14 <wilsonfisk>	sounds drab
Aug 31 20:23:42 <vavkamil>	kokokon, there was competition like this on darknet
Aug 31 20:23:56 <kokokon>	ooo where exactly?
Aug 31 20:24:38 <vavkamil>	you can rent the ransomware and compete with other blackhats, the top ones who infect most people will get discounts for other malware and stuff
Aug 31 20:25:04 <kokokon>	ransomware is risky
Aug 31 20:25:18 <kokokon>	you have to be very smart to do it
Aug 31 20:25:25 <wilsonfisk>	psh
Aug 31 20:25:29 <wilsonfisk>	that's a lie
Aug 31 20:25:50 <kokokon>	smart as in hiding your identity
Aug 31 20:26:46 <kokokon>	many clearnet black hat, hack sites simple collect people data  : )

Aug 31 20:27:03 <kokokon>	and or blackmail
Aug 31 20:27:34 <vavkamil>	kokokon, it was basically ransomware SaaS, you just need to spam people with it and will get cut from the profits
Aug 31 20:27:42 <kokokon>	lol
Aug 31 20:27:48 <kokokon>	well did they pay up?
Aug 31 20:28:02 <vavkamil>	idk didn't participate
Aug 31 20:28:42 <kokokon>	seems like a fake competition to me
Aug 31 20:28:47 <kokokon>	to id wannabes :D
Aug 31 20:29:17 <vavkamil>	it think that it was ShurL0ckr
Aug 31 20:29:53 <sophiee>	hi!

Aug 31 20:32:18 <sophiee>	heyas :)
Aug 31 20:33:40 <kokokon>	sophiee any ideas which printers are easiest to access? I am learning a bit with a help from shodan
Aug 31 20:33:54 <wilsonfisk>	most of them?
Aug 31 20:34:14 <roxfan>	define "access"
Aug 31 20:34:17 <vavkamil>	there was powershell script for printers on /r/netsec very recently
Aug 31 20:34:27 <wilsonfisk>	gross
Aug 31 20:34:32 <kokokon>	check previous prints and make it print more

Aug 31 20:35:58 <sophiee>	so like, wordpress sites are fucked cuz javascript is the devil, and china just found goo stuff on the moon, and if you get some dickface email from chaoscc sayin theyre video recording you watching porn it's bullshit. oh, also there's now a way to turn dead cats into cat zombies via science!
Aug 31 20:36:19 <vavkamil>	but very high percentage of accessible printers were hit by pewdiepie spam recently, so it might not be as easy anymore
Aug 31 20:36:47 <kokokon>	yes that moron
Aug 31 20:37:37 <kokokon>	sophiee there is a video of you watching Donald Trump speech and smiling, you have 2 choices now :D
Aug 31 20:38:12 <sophiee>	oh ya? then what color are my eyes?

Aug 31 20:40:31 <sophiee>	trump also says that if his twitter gets hacked, there's not much to learn lol
Aug 31 20:40:42 <katsumi>	soophie has steel blue eyes and a 50inch beard like zztop
Aug 31 20:40:52 <flyback>	hmm
Aug 31 20:40:57 <flyback>	from reading this ddrescue log
Aug 31 20:41:04 <flyback>	looks like the errors are in a few areas
Aug 31 20:41:09 <flyback>	clustered together
Aug 31 20:41:15 <sophiee>	katsumi: that'd be quite impressive, actually heh
Aug 31 20:41:17 <flyback>	if it's not on the mft table
Aug 31 20:41:19 <flyback>	that' a good thing
Aug 31 20:41:30 <katsumi>	;)
Aug 31 20:41:36 <kokokon>	flyback I have managed to find one open printer, well maybe open :)
Aug 31 20:42:05 <kokokon>	515, 631, 1022, 9100 ports
Aug 31 20:42:48 <katsumi>	and jumpin into zhe 10 foot pole
Aug 31 20:43:01 <kokokon>	lol now how I can check previous print jobs?
Aug 31 20:43:29 <vavkamil>	you know that's illegal right?
Aug 31 20:44:19 <calmclam>	cheeze it, it's the fuzz!
Aug 31 20:44:30 <kokokon>	vavkamil really? lol
Aug 31 20:44:42 <vavkamil>	I don't care, but it can get you banned here
Aug 31 20:45:18 <kokokon>	it's a test :P
Aug 31 20:45:26 <katsumi>	hey crime time at tv... he is listening to motörhead
Aug 31 20:48:43 <la_ensalada>	hi I'm playing around with RPKI ROAs and I want to decode one so I can view it. RFC6488 tells me that they're DER encoded and the file's hex signature (30 82) tells me the same but when I try to view it using   openssl x509 -in certificate.der -inform der -text -noout   I get errors
Aug 31 20:49:05 <la_ensalada>	anyone have ideas for the ensalada?
Aug 31 20:51:39 <vavkamil>	lol you are decoding certificates and making salad simultaneously?
Aug 31 20:51:57 <la_ensalada>	vavkamil, I am blessed with two hands
Aug 31 20:52:05 <kokokon>	how to route telnet via tor?
Aug 31 20:52:25 <kokokon>	torrify? :D
Aug 31 20:54:26 <vavkamil>	kokokon, proxychains should be fine
Aug 31 20:54:58 <kokokon>	ty kamil
Aug 31 20:55:03 <kokokon>	I like tor :)
Aug 31 20:56:46 <vavkamil>	just be sure to use TCP, no UDP
Aug 31 21:00:48 <kokokon>	why TCP?
Aug 31 21:05:11 <vavkamil>	proxychains works only with TCP I think
Aug 31 21:05:31 <vavkamil>	best to use Tails in VM to be sure
Aug 31 21:11:00 <danieldg>	tor does not support udp, that's why
Aug 31 21:11:11 <kokokon>	ok
Aug 31 21:11:29 <kokokon>	for some reason telnet via tor as proxy yet to work
Aug 31 21:11:37 <kokokon>	9050 9150 socks5
Aug 31 21:21:21 <kokokon>	perhaps printers telnet setup to block tor ips?

Sep 11 17:19:03 <iz>	no that was a serious press release that company put out, which a few other news outlets picked up

Sep 11 17:22:54 <flyback>	that

Sep 11 17:36:28 <nate>	dude12312414: To expand on your question, it's a serious 'article' from a company with an apparent history of bullshit claims and showing nothing for it and convieniently keeping all it's employees otherwise secret
Sep 11 17:36:48 <nate>	So it's probably bullshit from a company hoping to attention whore for stupid investors
Sep 11 17:38:55 <Jo-Anna>	The employees are declared to the irs or are they paid cash without being declared ? If it is the former the employees aren’t secret
Sep 11 17:39:59 <dude12312414>	hm yeah it does look shady
Sep 11 17:44:06 <nate>	Jo-Anna: Or they don't have any really.  Their linkedin page lists 8 'Employees", all of which apparently have hidden profiles
Sep 11 17:44:31 <nate>	dude12312414: The fact they claim collissions on SHA256 is -good- news for cryptocurrency should tell you how much bullshit it is alone

Sep 12 10:13:41 <praxis>	thought it might be conducive to be able to discuss it with others.
Sep 12 10:13:44 <praxis>	the os is about 5 years old, and has a bunch of outdated services running

Sep 12 12:01:01 <chazapp>	thoughts on https://github.com/OWASP/Amass for subdomain iteration ?
Sep 12 12:01:07 <chazapp>	-iteration + enumeration
Sep 12 12:10:15 <dylanwtf>	unless the DNS server is misconfigured you can't directly get a list of subdomains
Sep 12 12:10:28 <Guifle>	hello, how can I decrypt an img file which is the image of a luks partition?
Sep 12 12:10:34 <dylanwtf>	here is a guide on different methods
Sep 12 12:10:40 <dylanwtf>	https://appsecco.com/books/subdomain-enumeration/
Sep 12 12:11:35 <chazapp>	dylanwtf: yeah i know that's not a public available data. I'll be trying amass, but i don't want to bruteforce the target's server too hard
Sep 12 12:11:43 <chazapp>	thanks for the link tho
Sep 12 12:12:10 <dylanwtf>	use google dorks to try and find them
Sep 12 12:12:30 <dylanwtf>	if you want to be passive
Sep 12 12:12:42 <dylanwtf>	Guifle: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/504230/mount-encrypted-partition-of-an-image-file
Sep 12 12:13:06 <Guifle>	dylanwtf, thank you!
Sep 12 12:14:40 <chazapp>	dylanwtf: can you elaborate on Google Dorks ?
Sep 12 12:15:03 <dylanwtf>	a google dork is just a search string for google that helps you find something specific
Sep 12 12:15:03 <chazapp>	i vaguely remember that these are data google provides when it should not, but what can be done with that ?
Sep 12 12:15:23 <dylanwtf>	but that guide lists a bunch of other passive techniques too
Sep 12 12:15:31 <dylanwtf>	like looking at cert transparency logs
Sep 12 12:15:56 <dylanwtf>	you can use google to find subdomains that shouldn't be public
Sep 12 12:16:02 <dylanwtf>	like dev/test environments and such
Sep 12 12:16:57 <chazapp>	I'm thinking about subdomains cause the main frontend nmap showed TLS Cert was issued for "*.foobar.com"
Sep 12 12:17:29 <chazapp>	But ain't no more information, that stuff is behind amazon stuff
Sep 12 12:17:42 <dylanwtf>	go through the 'Passive sub-domain enumeration' section in that article
Sep 12 12:17:49 <dylanwtf>	you won't make any noise and you might find something
Sep 12 12:18:55 <dylanwtf>	you can also try a wordlist of the most common hostnames
Sep 12 12:31:58 <praxis>	do a dirbuster type thing
Sep 12 12:34:06 <praxis>	chazapp: nmap -sU -p 53 --script dns-nsec3-enum --script-args dns-nsec3-enum.domains=<domain> <dns-server>

Sep 12 13:41:01 <praxis>	i use expressvpn sometimes
Sep 12 13:45:44 <chazapp>	praxis: just saw your last message I was afk, which dns server should I target with that command ? Amazon's ?
Sep 12 13:46:40 <chazapp>	`amass` found 3 domains I knew of already, but I know there's more than these
Sep 12 13:48:06 <praxis>	chazapp: what's the target
Sep 12 13:50:47 <chazapp>	praxis: i think i found the dns target, but nmap says "DNSSEC NSEC3 not supported"
Sep 12 13:54:03 <praxis>	thats not the target, the target is the domain
Sep 12 13:54:29 <praxis>	you said foobar.com, but i'm guessing its not foobar.com
Sep 12 13:54:47 <chazapp>	i don't wanna give that info
Sep 12 13:54:50 <chazapp>	consider its foobar.co
Sep 12 13:59:07 <weedmic>	no, everything I could think of would not be free aaii

Sep 12 14:58:04 <audiofile>	I'm trying to do a buffer overflow for my infosec class and for some reason, my return address's last byte 0xff is converted to 0x0c. If you need more info do let me know!
Sep 12 14:59:42 <audiofile>	stackexchange tells me it's linefeed so it gets converted :/
Sep 12 15:06:06 <audiofile>	https://imgur.com/a/VaFUbpP here's how I run gdb and the C program basically does takes commandline arg and strcpy's to a char buffer. Examining the $esp shows data is getting written correctly except the last byte which affects the return address :/
Sep 12 15:06:35 <nsh>	actually in fact everything the computer does it correct
Sep 12 15:06:41 <nsh>	*is
Sep 12 15:06:45 <nsh>	the computer is infallible
Sep 12 15:07:22 <nsh>	even when it's behaving in an unspecified manner contrary to the assumptions of the users, developers and/or architects
Sep 12 15:08:16 <audiofile>	um ok
Sep 12 15:09:12 <nsh>	if the computers ravage humanity and turn all arable land into solar farms to help them make paperclips
Sep 12 15:09:16 <nsh>	it will be entirely our own fault
Sep 12 15:09:24 <nsh>	they'll be behaving perfectly the whole time
Sep 12 15:09:32 <Fieldy>	oh ok
Sep 12 15:09:50 <nsh>	what we need to do is turn off all the computers until we fix humanity
Sep 12 15:09:54 <nsh>	and then we can have nice things again maybe
Sep 12 15:10:11 <audiofile>	i thought you were gonna tell me how to fix my issue lol
Sep 12 15:11:04 <audiofile>	fixed it missing \x

Sep 12 15:50:44 <Criten>	is that just because they have shitty rules around what server they use?
Sep 12 15:52:00 <Hack5190>	Because I run my own - should comment that in the file, thanks Criten
Sep 12 15:54:17 <audiofile>	is firefox less cpu intensive than chrome?
Sep 12 15:55:08 <Criten>	ah gotcha Hack5190 - cool
Sep 12 15:55:15 <Criten>	audiofile: not sure
Sep 12 15:55:33 <Criten>	audiofile: i've heard its better on memory and such
Sep 12 15:55:45 <Criten>	it goes back and forth pretty frequently with them trying to one up eachother
Sep 12 15:55:48 <audiofile>	oh ok! chrome takes up 7-8 gigs for me :/
Sep 12 15:55:48 <Hack5190>	warning added Criten - thanks mate
Sep 12 15:56:07 <Criten>	Hack5190: that's what peer reviews are for :D
Sep 12 15:56:46 <Hack5190>	agreed - wish some people didnt take feedback so harsh

Sep 12 19:21:53 <c0mmy>	So I am following this https://blog.secureideas.com/2014/01/intercepting-dns.html, Setup everything as in the tutorial, but...when I visit a website I just get nothing, webpage not available, although I can see it in burpsuite history and in dnschef
Sep 12 19:22:46 <katsumi_>	^^
Sep 12 19:23:01 <c0mmy>	katsumi_: ?

Sep 12 19:29:08 <c0mmy>	who's willing to do some cool tests on the tutorial above
Sep 12 19:29:17 <c0mmy>	https://blog.secureideas.com/2014/01/intercepting-dns.html,
Sep 12 19:29:52 <vavkamil>	c0mmy, are you trying it on windows 10?
Sep 12 19:30:09 <nate>	Jesus fuck a plane just like lowballed overhead my town
Sep 12 19:31:48 <c0mmy>	vavkami: Burpsuite on win 10 and the rest (webmitm, dnschef, beef) on a kali box.
Sep 12 19:31:56 <technonerd>	Did the sound come second?
Sep 12 19:32:50 <vavkamil>	c0mmy, well it's article from 2014, it will only work on http:// websites and win 10 as I know have some protection against DNS spoofing
Sep 12 19:33:11 <c0mmy>	vavkamil: Who's talking about DNS spoofing?
Sep 12 19:33:53 <c0mmy>	it should work on both http and https, https sites will give that notification about the certificate etc
Sep 12 19:34:03 <c0mmy>	but I've tried an http site and it didnt open
Sep 12 19:34:13 <c0mmy>	however I was able to hook it via beef
Sep 12 19:34:27 <c0mmy>	but why didn't the page open
Sep 12 19:34:31 <c0mmy>	in the browser
Sep 12 19:34:51 <katsumi_>	what agent u use?
Sep 12 19:35:56 <c0mmy>	internet explorer
Sep 12 19:36:07 <vavkamil>	how were you able to hook it with beef if the page didn't open
Sep 12 19:36:12 <katsumi_>	try wget
Sep 12 19:36:17 <katsumi_>	;)
Sep 12 19:36:18 <c0mmy>	the page didn't open but it got hooked
Sep 12 19:36:31 <c0mmy>	not an https one
Sep 12 19:36:33 <katsumi_>	or curl
Sep 12 19:36:34 <c0mmy>	an http one
Sep 12 19:36:45 <vavkamil>	that doesn't make any sense
Sep 12 19:36:57 <c0mmy>	vavkamil: You wanna test that?
Sep 12 19:37:17 <katsumi_>	if page filtering out
Sep 12 19:37:25 <vavkamil>	way complicated scenario for basic test
Sep 12 19:37:55 <nate>	Huh, we have a C130 circling the town, well people are gonna be freaking out today lol
Sep 12 19:38:07 <c0mmy>	vavkamil: I"ve got the full setup ready for this setup man.
Sep 12 19:38:43 <c0mmy>	And I can spin up stuff in the cloud.
Sep 12 19:39:12 <vavkamil>	cool but I don't
Sep 12 19:39:22 <c0mmy>	vavkamil: You don't have to.
Sep 12 19:39:43 <vavkamil>	ok so you have DNS server ready that I can test?
Sep 12 19:39:56 <c0mmy>	vavkamil: Sure.
Sep 12 19:40:03 <vavkamil>	pass the IP then
Sep 12 19:40:53 <superherointj>	@nate, why is that?

Sep 12 19:44:10 <katsumi_>	funny ppl
Sep 12 19:44:24 <nate>	superherointj: I'm in a small town, a C-130 is pretty big for our airport size.  But we do have a joint military base up at our small airport so it's probably just an exercise, but a C-130 flying low around mountains and valley is REALLY loud and not something seen usually here :P
Sep 12 19:44:48 <nate>	Last time we had one flying around here was shortly after 9/11, I think one came in for some maintenance or something
Sep 12 19:45:52 <bubbajbubba>	Vs here where we have F-18s here leaving Mayport NAS that like to zing up and down the St. Johns river every morning. Kinda comforting hearing them zing on by.
Sep 12 19:47:16 <nate>	Most we usually have here on occasion (and I mean maybe a few times a month) are blackhawk's and apache's as that's primarily whats up at that base, there's a big medical marine outfit there and they do a lot of training in the blackhawks as well as woodland stuff since we're up in the mountains
Sep 12 19:48:34 <bubbajbubba>	yeah, the closest Apaches to us are probably at Ft. Rucker in AL. See plenty of Navy Seahawks, though.

Sep 12 19:50:09 <katsumi_>	toolß thors hanner
Sep 12 19:50:12 <Grayson>	nate I think if our phishing email says it only works in IE people won't open it
Sep 12 19:57:23 <beanbag->	pikarma
Sep 12 19:57:50 <beanbag->	now I just need to find out if it will work with any existing network cards or old routers I have around
Sep 12 19:59:41 <beanbag->	they also fail to list what revision TP LINK TL-WN722N they require
Sep 12 19:59:49 <beanbag->	1x is atheros based, 2 and 3 are realtek

Sep 12 20:04:12 <bubbajbubba>	What's worse is they give you a pic of an angry pink unicorn sneering at you.
Sep 12 20:23:56 <beanbag->	hmm I think I have a atheros usb module
Sep 12 20:24:09 <beanbag->	it's useless due to lack of win10 drivers but fine for linux and this
Sep 12 20:24:51 <Pilate>	https://github.com/0x90/wifi-arsenal - dunno where you got that weird link
Sep 12 20:29:01 <beanbag->	thx
Sep 12 20:35:02 <beanbag->	I got a old laptop with a canucked screeen and hd that would be perfect for this
Sep 12 20:35:19 <beanbag->	the damage to the screen isn't enough to destroy it's use as a wifi detector and I got spare hd's

Sep 16 16:11:07 <bashquest>	then u'll get.
Sep 16 16:11:35 <bashquest>	u need math.
Sep 16 16:11:43 <SymbioticFemale>	bashquest: explain that to me
Sep 16 16:11:50 <dedekating>	hm... i ll take a look reveiw that
Sep 16 16:11:55 <SymbioticFemale>	bashquest: or you're pushing on the word 'super'?
Sep 16 16:12:11 <dedekating>	what math??? hell no im realy dumb of that
Sep 16 16:12:14 <bashquest>	a super hacker is very good in math i guess
Sep 16 16:12:22 <SymbioticFemale>	:/
Sep 16 16:12:43 <bashquest>	dedekating: then forget the super hacker.
Sep 16 16:12:56 <SymbioticFemale>	bashquest: just let him be a super hacker
Sep 16 16:13:16 <bashquest>	idc
Sep 16 16:13:25 <bashquest>	its not my exploding dream
Sep 16 16:13:31 <SymbioticFemale>	don't take the skid's dream from him
Sep 16 16:14:03 <dedekating>	thanks btw i got to roll
Sep 16 16:14:08 <dedekating>	see u soon
Sep 16 16:14:10 <SymbioticFemale>	c u
Sep 16 16:15:37 <SymbioticFemale>	i feel like the greatest way possible to troll ##security would be to start a web chat for technical support problems that puts users directly from google into ##security, with not even the technical know-how required to install hexchat.
Sep 16 16:16:32 <bashquest>	hexchat is a bit creepy. it works. but creepy
Sep 16 16:16:36 <bashquest>	write your own client
Sep 16 16:16:38 <SymbioticFemale>	10/10, i would be amused.
Sep 16 16:17:34 <SymbioticFemale>	i should have told him to install IRSSI on a VPS and then use putty to connect to it
Sep 16 16:19:03 <ilikeyou>	lol
Sep 16 16:20:24 <weedmic>	this is what I see when people type lol - https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/2014/07/10__23_31_27/Tie_Fighter_Front.png264b4307-245c-4be1-ac3e-dd83120e358bOriginal.jpg
Sep 16 16:27:57 <Alexander-47u>	calmclam thanks
Sep 16 16:30:38 <ilikeyou>	fun fact, EmmyNoether was a mathematician
Sep 16 16:37:36 <at0m>	.g noethers theorem
Sep 16 16:37:42 <EmmyNoether>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem
Sep 16 16:38:37 <at0m>	from what i remember, one of the things there is that 'every conservation law links to a constant of nature'
Sep 16 16:39:16 <at0m>	or was it on symmetries? probably both eh
Sep 16 16:58:44 <bashquest>	so theres so much canadian bullshit info but no solution ... ?
Sep 16 16:59:00 <jabberwock>	bashquest: Don't be influenced by flyback :P
Sep 16 16:59:06 <bashquest>	whos flyback
Sep 16 16:59:19 <jabberwock>	The one who says "canuck" about 1,000 times a day
Sep 16 16:59:25 <jabberwock>	obsessively lol
Sep 16 16:59:41 <jabberwock>	You two were chatting last night
Sep 16 16:59:51 <bashquest>	i mean the thinfoil hats
Sep 16 17:01:07 <Jo-Anna>	What did I miss ?
Sep 16 17:02:21 <bashquest>	i dont mean im crazy

Sep 17 10:51:45 <nindustries>	So i'm a cybersec freelancer, but a company wants to pull me in a regular employee. Anyone did that move/comparison before/
Sep 17 11:00:44 <nate>	nindustries: Considering most companies don't want to bother with relocation, generally no.  But for me it would mainly depend on the pay and cost of living wherever they were
Sep 17 11:02:59 <nindustries>	nate: it's a difficult exercise for sure.. this would be for a nearby company
Sep 17 11:03:22 <nindustries>	and offer the possibility to transition to a manager role (create cybersec team w/ 4 engineers)
Sep 17 11:03:35 <nindustries>	I basically said "convince me", so let's just wait
Sep 17 11:19:20 <flawseeker>	well comparison is probably you're less paid as a regular employee, less freedom, you have a hierarchy  and coworkers to deal with. On the positive side, you might get broader mission because you're a team, you're part of a team, and income is more secure
Sep 17 11:19:48 <flawseeker>	mainly depends what you prefer
Sep 17 11:42:57 <nate>	I'm beginning to think HP has purposely sabotaged these envy laptops from being able to sanely install any linux onto them
Sep 17 12:06:30 <voices>	what's the rough amd equivalent ot the intel core i7
Sep 17 12:07:11 <nate>	Probably the Ryzen 7
Sep 17 12:07:18 <nate>	(AMD wasn't all that creative with the naming)
Sep 17 12:07:19 <voices>	thought so
Sep 17 12:08:23 <voices>	ryzen is kinda creative. i mean, it's not a word.. or is it n_n
Sep 17 12:15:27 <voices>	so what makes it an i7
Sep 17 12:15:51 <voices>	is it just a name, or does the 7 represent something
Sep 17 12:16:11 <voices>	i used to think it was just the generation
Sep 17 12:16:42 <voices>	but i see there are 9th Gen i7s now
Sep 17 12:17:38 <voices>	10th Gen now even
Sep 17 12:17:59 <nate>	voices: Same thing that makes it a Ryzen 7, different features than the 5's and 3's
Sep 17 12:18:00 <nate>	:P
Sep 17 12:18:13 <nate>	Just like in the past you had Core 2 Duo's, Core 2 quads, etc
Sep 17 12:18:46 <nate>	Same architectures, just slightly different clocks, capacities, etc
Sep 17 12:21:17 <voices>	yeah, but the 7 doesn't represent like ... seven... something's
Sep 17 12:21:59 <voices>	no, i6
Sep 17 12:22:57 <voices>	like a quad has 4 cores
Sep 17 12:29:24 <dedekating>	hello hackies
Sep 17 12:30:08 <dedekating>	is all hacker using libeeboot-ed machine?
Sep 17 12:58:38 <scapegoat0>	Hey, is it safe to GPG encrypt a ZIP file with AES256? I'm asking because I read somewhere that if you are encrypting something like a codebase, common patterns like your pom.xml can make it significantly easier to recover your encryption key by just having the ciphertext itself only?
Sep 17 13:26:11 <KidBeta>	scapegoat0: AES does not have a known plaintext attack
Sep 17 13:26:31 <KidBeta>	knowing the contents shouldn't really help in any meaningful way
Sep 17 13:35:49 <orlock>	nsh: yo
Sep 17 13:38:32 <orlock>	nsh: I'm seeing something weird you might have come across with an AXFR
Sep 17 13:39:33 <orlock>	i get roughly 3k of data in response to a dig -t axfr
Sep 17 13:40:16 <orlock>	packet dump says that i get more data back from the server, never reaches the client
Sep 17 13:41:22 <orlock>	dig gives a read error.
Sep 17 13:41:45 <orlock>	i've been sucked into djb's notes on axfr
Sep 17 13:42:04 <orlock>	man he has an issue with the guys behind bind.
Sep 17 13:42:11 <orlock>	https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/axfr-notes.html
Sep 17 13:42:58 <nsh>	which server?
Sep 17 13:43:11 <nsh>	don't know anything about AXFR tbh and precious little about DNS in general
Sep 17 13:43:27 <nsh>	but that's most likely a misconf
Sep 17 13:43:35 <nsh>	esp if it will respond to the query by UDP
Sep 17 13:43:48 <nsh>	(DoS amplification vector)
Sep 17 13:44:39 <nate>	nsh: TL;DR is that AXFR was designed for syncing of a sort, so it had all records.  Meaning you could read all records, including the ones that might be wanted kept private from a nameserver
Sep 17 13:44:59 <nate>	it's not related to the old DNS Amplification/Reflection attack stuff
Sep 17 13:45:32 *	nsh nods
Sep 17 13:49:26 <orlock>	nsh: EH, sorry - Must have you confused, i thought you were having lots of fun with axfr previously?
Sep 17 13:51:09 <orlock>	I'm actually unsure of the server type. Guess i'll just see if it acts broken on AD infrastructure as well.
Sep 17 13:51:23 <nsh>	not i as far as i recall
Sep 17 13:52:15 <orlock>	Must have gotten you confused with a different smedly butler
Sep 17 13:54:58 <nsh>	happens all the time
Sep 17 13:55:25 <nate>	ugh why must the ubuntu channel always be dead the rare times I got issues
Sep 17 13:55:26 <nate>	lol
Sep 17 13:56:06 <Kryczek>	nate: what issue?
Sep 17 13:57:14 <nate>	Kryczek: Intel graphics issue, it's technically a kali problem but since kali is based off ubuntu I tested ubuntu also and it does the same thing.  When launching it on a fresh install it just enters into a blank terminal looking screen with a blinking cursor, generally indicative of video driver problems
Sep 17 13:57:35 <nate>	Something I've fixed before but it appears the switches for booting into a purely terminal/console mode no longer exist or were changed
Sep 17 13:59:06 <nate>	Used to be something like `nomodeset splash` added to the end of the boot line in grub but it doesn't do anything, the closest I did get was adding those to the end of the recovery mode boot, but the most that got me was to...
Sep 17 14:01:16 <nate>	https://i.imgur.com/uMdm4cN.jpg to this, it hits that and then just hangs w/ the flashing cursor like it tried to boot into a graphical mode again.  Unfortunately the damned live mode on USB is being weird too.  HP laptops are so fucky trying to work with linux on :/
Sep 17 14:01:33 <Kryczek>	nate: have you tried "nomodeset" alone? I would remove "splash" and "quiet" to see all the messages, and maybe "splash" even turns modeset back on
Sep 17 14:02:01 <Kryczek>	I mean alone as in without splash
Sep 17 14:02:08 <nate>	quiet is usually there by default, so I haven't removed that no, I -believe- I Tried nomodeset alone at one point but I'll try again
Sep 17 14:02:14 <Kryczek>	not alone all by itself on the kernel command line
Sep 17 14:02:34 <nate>	I saw some referneces to doing a 'nomodeset splash 3' too but it also didn't do anything, also some references to a 'nomodeset text' and etc etc
Sep 17 14:02:45 <Kryczek>	remove also if you see something like vthandoff or however it's spelled
Sep 17 14:03:01 <Kryczek>	any chance you can copy/paste the line?
Sep 17 14:03:43 <nate>	Not really since I can't get it booted lol, I'd just have to take another screen shot.  I wonder if the LVH setup is maybe some how at fault, but I wouldn't -think- that would impact this
Sep 17 14:04:26 <Kryczek>	it doesn't have SSH?
Sep 17 14:06:41 <nate>	Hard to SSH into it when you can't even get booted in to decrypt it :P
Sep 17 14:07:19 <Kryczek>	does it respond to ping at least?
Sep 17 14:07:30 <Kryczek>	ah no wait I guess LUKS is before networking
Sep 17 14:07:37 <Kryczek>	(unless you use dracut)
Sep 17 14:07:49 <nate>	Not just that but I never pre-configured the wireless, and I don't have a wired adapter for this particular laptop unfortunately
Sep 17 14:10:02 <nate>	Main problem to doing all that though is long-term I want this thing to be LVM encrypted so any fix discoveries without it probably wouldn't work
Sep 17 14:10:23 <nate>	Or well
Sep 17 14:10:36 <nate>	I guess I can do all the encryption post a non-encrypted install...
Sep 17 14:10:37 <nate>	hmph
Sep 17 14:13:08 <Kryczek>	does it have a TPM?
Sep 17 14:13:42 <nate>	Yeah, cause I had originally done it at install time
Sep 17 14:14:50 <Kryczek>	I am not sure I follow... I mean does the laptop have a Trusted Platform Module?
Sep 17 14:18:31 <nate>	Oh, oh, sorry, I was thinking of something different.  No, it shouldn't, it was just a general consumer laptop
Sep 17 14:18:49 <nate>	I did have to disable UEFI (go into legacy BIOS mode) to even get things installed though since HP UEFI interface's are a disaster
Sep 17 14:20:36 <Kryczek>	I know the feeling :) I use UEFI only when I want to play with UEFI Secure Boot
Sep 17 14:21:25 <nate>	Yeah, well I had that disabled originally anyways but with it in legacy mode that's not a concern either
Sep 17 14:48:24 <mnemon>	nate: it's an issue with X or the graphical mode terminal?
Sep 17 14:49:35 <mnemon>	anyways removing quiet and splash should show something unless it fails already on loading the kernel
Sep 17 15:10:37 <nate>	mnemon: No idea since I can't get it that far, but I think I figured it out possibly
Sep 17 15:10:45 <nate>	it's still booting UEFI mode despite the BIOS option being set to legacy lol
Sep 17 15:11:44 <nate>	I forgot, when I first installed I explicitly booted the USB image from the system start up diags, it has a UEFI and non UEFI boot mode options so I explicitly did a USB Boot (Non-UEFI), but when it autoboots it does it in UEFI.  This HP is so fucked up
Sep 17 15:11:52 <nate>	Maybe I should see if it has a firmware update available
Sep 17 15:25:36 <ilikeyou>	nate: you could always try chrooting into it. troubleshoot from there. you can see if luks is still in one piece, and can look into that efi boot partition. can also test X in chroot without worrying about efi or legacy. eliminate those at least, before you go on a wild goose chase.

Sep 17 16:55:36 <rindolf>	Hi all! I posted this lesson from master Yoda about security - https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1173867402997768193
Sep 17 16:56:06 <Oladon_wfh>	Posted it, did you?
Sep 17 16:56:21 <rindolf>	Oladon_wfh: it is my twitter
Sep 17 16:56:53 <rindolf>	Oladon_wfh: the youtube upload was not mine
Sep 17 17:01:35 <rindolf>	Oladon_wfh: back when i posted a link to https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ to fulldisclosure after getting the admin's approval on irc/email some redditors later scolded me for publishing imaginary fanfic there. some months later - the Snowden news broke
Sep 17 17:02:45 <rindolf>	Oladon_wfh: do you agree that one should not be overly paranoid about security and privacy?
Sep 17 17:04:49 <nsh>	paranoia isn't like atmosphere control
Sep 17 17:04:59 <nsh>	you don't just pick a temperature level you feel comfortable with and that's it
Sep 17 17:05:06 <Oopserator>	I agree that one should not be *overly* paranoid, but a measure of caution is always good
Sep 17 17:05:12 <nsh>	paranoia is like conversation, or mobility, or a martial art
Sep 17 17:05:34 <nsh>	it's a thing you must refine and hone and practice and apply daily and introspect as to whether the application was better or worse placed
Sep 17 17:05:39 <Oopserator>	paranoia is the *irrational* fear of something... If you have a rational reason for taking precautions, it's valid
Sep 17 17:05:43 <nsh>	whether the methods were more or less effective
Sep 17 17:05:55 <nsh>	it is not a quantative thing one raises or lowers to find an optimal
Sep 17 17:05:59 <nsh>	this is bad thinking
Sep 17 17:06:19 <nsh>	it's like asking "what level of driving is appropriate for urban shanghai"
Sep 17 17:06:47 <nsh>	it's complex, it's contextual, it's stylistic and its informed by at least semiformalised models and assessments
Sep 17 17:06:57 <nsh>	paranoia is something you learn. it's not something you just do harder
Sep 17 17:07:06 <Oopserator>	so, nsh, you're saying it's contextual
Sep 17 17:07:23 <Oopserator>	if so, I agree
Sep 17 17:07:25 <Mibd>	lol
Sep 17 17:07:30 <Oopserator>	Proper security is the mitigation of risk to an acceptable level
Sep 17 17:07:36 <Mibd>	there is no 99%security
Sep 17 17:07:42 <Mibd>	or 50%
Sep 17 17:07:46 <Mibd>	its only 100%
Sep 17 17:08:06 <Mibd>	you have it or dont
Sep 17 17:08:10 <Mibd>	there's no half of it
Sep 17 17:08:14 <rindolf>	Oladon_wfh: i also came up with a new nsa factoid: "The NSA agents are not only afraid of their own shadow, but whenever they see any shadow whatsoever they have to do a saving throw with a twenty sided die where rolling 1 results in a severe heart attack. The NSA's intensive care unit is very busy"
Sep 17 17:08:36 <SymbioticFemale>	nsh: paranoia is something you learn? i've always thought that the best security professionals tend to have gotten their paranoia from the cheese pizza
Sep 17 17:08:51 <SymbioticFemale>	nsh: is that within or outside of your suggestion that paranoia is learned? is their paranoia learned?
Sep 17 17:09:27 <Oopserator>	Mibd,  think your statement is both confusing, and fundamentally wrong
Sep 17 17:09:34 <Mibd>	lol what
Sep 17 17:09:40 <Oopserator>	First of all, you don't "have" security, you exercise it
Sep 17 17:09:42 <SymbioticFemale>	rindolf: not sure what you are getting at here
Sep 17 17:09:58 <Mibd>	and if you exercise it you have it?
Sep 17 17:10:10 <Oopserator>	there is no "have".
Sep 17 17:10:16 <Oopserator>	You don't "have" medicine
Sep 17 17:10:24 <Oopserator>	you don't "have" engineering
Sep 17 17:10:33 <SymbioticFemale>	Oopserator: don't dig into the words like this
Sep 17 17:10:39 <Oopserator>	you exercise it, practice it, execute secure operations
Sep 17 17:10:47 <Mibd>	:)
Sep 17 17:10:49 <nsh>	one has languages, but that means to have learned and assimilated
Sep 17 17:10:56 <Mibd>	security is secure from start
Sep 17 17:11:00 <Mibd>	not with time or exercise
Sep 17 17:11:01 <Oopserator>	SymbioticFemale, words are important (to some, anyway)
Sep 17 17:11:12 <Oladon_wfh>	Mibd: By that argument, nothing is ever secure.
Sep 17 17:11:20 <Mibd>	Oladon_wfh, that is ture
Sep 17 17:11:24 <Mibd>	true'
Sep 17 17:11:27 <Mibd>	we dont have security
Sep 17 17:11:30 <Oopserator>	In most cases, you cannot be 100% "secure", but you can, as I mentioned previously, *mitigate risk to an acceptable level*
Sep 17 17:11:31 <Mibd>	and we cant have it
Sep 17 17:11:33 <Oladon_wfh>	So why bother trying?
Sep 17 17:11:38 <rindolf>	SymbioticFemale: just sharing stuff
Sep 17 17:11:39 <Mibd>	noone said that
Sep 17 17:11:54 <Oladon_wfh>	Mibd: I'm saying it — it's the logical progression of your logic.
Sep 17 17:11:55 <SymbioticFemale>	rindolf: from where did that come from?
Sep 17 17:12:11 <Mibd>	can you guarantee anything?
Sep 17 17:12:12 <Mibd>	no
Sep 17 17:12:23 <Oopserator>	I'm ask all the time: "Are we secure?", to which I (usually) respond: "We're more secure."
Sep 17 17:12:26 <Mibd>	not the air not the water not the code
Sep 17 17:12:27 <Mibd>	never
Sep 17 17:12:31 <Mibd>	or anything else
Sep 17 17:12:41 <Oladon_wfh>	Oopserator: I'm sorry you have to work with people who ask you that :P
Sep 17 17:12:54 <rindolf>	using ssh instead of telnet is rational. using noscript is fine
Sep 17 17:13:06 <Oopserator>	I'm glad I do, Oladon_wfh, that's what keeps me employed! :)
Sep 17 17:13:36 <Oladon_wfh>	Oopserator: Heh, fair point. Though I manage pretty well with only external people asking me silly questions like that :P
Sep 17 17:13:47 <rindolf>	going to great lengths to avoid all trackers and not opening twitter links is paranoia
Sep 17 17:13:55 <Oopserator>	rindolf, it's all about your comfort level, your tolerance to risk
Sep 17 17:14:13 <rindolf>	Oopserator: well, maybe
Sep 17 17:14:20 <Oopserator>	Oladon_wfh, external to what?
Sep 17 17:14:37 <Oladon_wfh>	the company
Sep 17 17:14:49 <rindolf>	Oopserator: i'm not afraid of what the nsa knows about me
Sep 17 17:15:11 <rindolf>	they dont share it with anyone anyway
Sep 17 17:15:26 <nate>	I mean that's... really not true
Sep 17 17:15:31 <Oopserator>	so, Oladon_wfh, you're saying everyone in your company is knowledgeable when it comes to Security?
Sep 17 17:16:01 <nate>	rindolf: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement may be worth a read :P
Sep 17 17:16:13 <Oladon_wfh>	Oopserator: To various degrees — I'd never pull a Mibd and say you're either 100% knowledgeable or 0% :P
Sep 17 17:16:16 <Oopserator>	unfortunately there's a lot of over-sharing when it comes to PII
Sep 17 17:16:19 <flawseeker>	they share their exploits with the whole world, so our data…
Sep 17 17:16:27 <rindolf>	and i dont mind ppl seeing what pseudo-porn or soft porn i'm reading
Sep 17 17:16:42 <Oladon_wfh>	Oopserator: But they're pretty good, and they all want to learn.
Sep 17 17:17:14 <Oopserator>	Oladon_wfh, lucky you , I guess
Sep 17 17:17:20 <Oladon_wfh>	:)
Sep 17 17:17:40 <rindolf>	nate: well, they dont share it with anyone outside their limited circle
Sep 17 17:17:58 <Oopserator>	I work in a fairly large company, with many people, with many competencies, and many levels of competency when it comes to Security.
Sep 17 17:18:09 <Oopserator>	That's why they hired me, to fill in the gaps :)
Sep 17 17:18:14 <Mibd>	well if you have 5% knowledge how do you expect to have 100% security?
Sep 17 17:18:15 <Oladon_wfh>	Oopserator: That's fair.
Sep 17 17:18:21 <Oladon_wfh>	Mibd: :P
Sep 17 17:18:25 <Mibd>	when you cant guarantee anything
Sep 17 17:18:33 <Mibd>	how do you expect your code to be secure
Sep 17 17:18:48 <dedekating>	hey guys
Sep 17 17:18:49 <rindolf>	nate: someone told me that  the nsa recruiters he met smiled too much and flinched
Sep 17 17:18:52 <Mibd>	when the code isnt even math. proven correct
Sep 17 17:19:05 <Oopserator>	speaking of which, I should get back to my work, here, so I'll just 'lurk', i.e. come back from time to time to follow this interesting conversation
Sep 17 17:19:28 <Oladon_wfh>	Yeah, I should get back to this very exciting Vendor Security Risk Assessment I'm filling out...
Sep 17 17:19:32 <Mibd>	you're patching the holes instead of replacing whats faulty
Sep 17 17:19:36 <Oopserator>	(seriously: I've been lurking in this channel for over a week, and this is the first "good" discussion on security I've seen!)
Sep 17 17:19:56 <rindolf>	no one in his right mind will work for the nsa. but naturally some ppl are not in their right minds
Sep 17 17:20:22 <Mibd>	rindolf, then who protects your country, or at least try
Sep 17 17:20:28 <Mibd>	who keeps you safe
Sep 17 17:20:36 <Mibd>	"safe"
Sep 17 17:20:41 <rindolf>	Mibd: the nsa?
Sep 17 17:20:52 <rindolf>	Mibd: i am israeli
Sep 17 17:21:03 <Mibd>	then mossad
Sep 17 17:21:06 <Mibd>	or whats called
Sep 17 17:21:34 <rindolf>	Mibd: i was told everyone in the intelligence community hates the nsa
Sep 17 17:21:41 <Mibd>	why
Sep 17 17:21:46 <rindolf>	Mibd: ah, the mossad
Sep 17 17:22:03 <Oladon_wfh>	rindolf: What's with your obsession with the NSA?
Sep 17 17:22:19 <nate>	Considering the nature of shit mossad does I'm pretty sure you have far worse concerns to be had than the US NSA
Sep 17 17:22:20 <nate>	lol
Sep 17 17:22:33 <iz>	maybe that's why :b
Sep 17 17:22:39 <rindolf>	Oladon_wfh: then let's stop
Sep 17 17:22:47 <Oladon_wfh>	To quote Zaphod Beeblebrox, "The NSA's just this guy, you know?"
Sep 17 17:22:49 <iz>	YOU guys are the bad ones, we don't do anything bad!
Sep 17 17:22:53 <gurrkiin>	whats mossad?
Sep 17 17:23:05 <nate>	gurrkiin: Israeli intelligence
Sep 17 17:23:05 <gurrkiin>	also fuck the NSA
Sep 17 17:23:16 <nate>	they just tend to also be considered practical assassins too
Sep 17 17:23:21 <Mibd>	gurrkiin, the kgb of israel:)
Sep 17 17:23:35 <gurrkiin>	aha ok, dont mess with em so
Sep 17 17:23:41 <Oladon_wfh>	To be fair, there's not a lot of proof of that last claim, nate :P
Sep 17 17:23:51 <Oladon_wfh>	(Nor would there be if they really are...)
Sep 17 17:23:55 <nate>	gurrkiin: If you don't want your balls hooked up to a car battery while you're waterboarded, no, no you don't
Sep 17 17:23:56 <nate>	lol
Sep 17 17:24:03 <iz>	more proof than "i was told everyone hates the NSA"
Sep 17 17:24:12 <Oladon_wfh>	iz: heh
Sep 17 17:24:19 <dedekating>	ive heard somwhere that nasa and iss will move from windows to linux, is that true?
Sep 17 17:24:35 <Oladon_wfh>	Probably, at some point.
Sep 17 17:24:39 <Mibd>	call them and ask them
Sep 17 17:24:40 <nate>	Oladon_wfh: There is a LOT of 'evidence' of that, go look up their lists of "alleged assassinations" lol
Sep 17 17:24:55 <SymbioticFemale>	dedekating: iss is on windoze?
Sep 17 17:25:02 <nate>	dedekating: NASA has used multiple platforms for ages
Sep 17 17:25:09 <Mibd>	SymbioticFemale, with thinkpads:)

Sep 17 17:52:11 <dedekating>	did u write something bout solomon magick?
Sep 17 18:10:01 <SymbioticFemale>	well they did it again. Stallman is out from MIT and the FSF https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/09/17/0446239/richard-stallman-resigns-from-mit
Sep 17 18:10:45 <SymbioticFemale>	political correctness destroying the FOSS community
Sep 17 18:11:46 <SymbioticFemale>	taking out people like Jacob Appelbaum and Richard Stallman
Sep 17 18:12:24 <SymbioticFemale>	surely to be replaced by corporate or three-letter shills
Sep 17 18:13:29 <Mibd>	it was his decision
Sep 17 18:13:39 <Mibd>	he didnt got fired
Sep 17 18:13:46 <Mibd>	he resigned as his own will
Sep 17 18:13:51 <SymbioticFemale>	https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scientist-richard-stallman-described-epstein-victims-as-entirely-willing
Sep 17 18:14:03 <nate>	mibd: That's... 99% of the time how resignations work
Sep 17 18:14:17 <nate>	people get ultimatums, go out on your own apparent terms or get fired and potentially embarassed
Sep 17 18:14:18 <nate>	lol
Sep 17 18:14:21 <Mibd>	yeah but people say that he was forced
Sep 17 18:14:25 <Mibd>	noone can force you do shit
Sep 17 18:14:29 <SymbioticFemale>	exactly nate
Sep 17 18:14:33 <SymbioticFemale>	""I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations." "
Sep 17 18:14:40 <nate>	I mean they can, by telling him if he doesn't then he's getting fired anyways
Sep 17 18:14:53 <SymbioticFemale>	yep
Sep 17 18:21:03 <xochilpili>	hello everyone

Sep 17 18:30:21 <teardown>	are you owning milters

Sep 17 18:32:37 <teardown>	ok im exaggerating. i only know of one very lange webhosting conglemerate which runs it
Sep 17 18:32:44 <teardown>	*large
Sep 17 18:32:53 *	teardown cant type today
Sep 17 18:42:04 <beanbag->	I think I am giving up on pidense
Sep 17 18:42:24 <beanbag->	you have to fight various system daemons for control of a 2ndary wifi device
Sep 17 18:42:49 <mawk>	what is pidense
Sep 17 18:43:49 <beanbag->	tool for detecting evil wifi attacks
Sep 17 18:46:25 <beanbag->	either the sw hasn't been updated with distros or they broke something
Sep 17 18:51:28 <mawk>	a
Sep 17 18:51:46 <mawk>	you have a specific error ?
Sep 17 18:56:50 <Inconvenience>	dont cameras add personal info to images
Sep 17 18:56:53 <Inconvenience>	?
Sep 17 18:56:55 <mawk>	yes
Sep 17 18:56:58 <mawk>	you can strip the info
Sep 17 18:57:01 <Inconvenience>	how
Sep 17 18:57:08 <mawk>	for instance you can upload to my wonderful site: https://pix.watch
Sep 17 18:57:14 <mawk>	it strips the info automatically on upload
Sep 17 18:57:28 <Inconvenience>	what abotu just doing a screencap
Sep 17 18:57:30 <Inconvenience>	on debian?
Sep 17 18:57:44 <mawk>	no info in a screenshot I think
Sep 17 18:57:46 <mawk>	you can verify
Sep 17 18:57:52 <mawk>	http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi
Sep 17 18:57:56 <Inconvenience>	what am i looking for
Sep 17 18:58:02 <mawk>	upload your screenshot to the site
Sep 17 18:58:04 <mawk>	http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi
Sep 17 18:58:09 <mawk>	it will tell about any metadata
Sep 17 18:58:12 <Inconvenience>	no i want to look myself
Sep 17 18:58:14 <mawk>	lol
Sep 17 18:58:20 <Inconvenience>	is there a tool
Sep 17 18:58:27 <mawk>	no
Sep 17 18:58:28 <mawk>	not for you
Sep 17 18:58:30 <Inconvenience>	or just looking at it with vim
Sep 17 18:58:33 <mawk>	yes do that
Sep 17 18:58:35 <mawk>	open it with ed
Sep 17 18:58:39 <mawk>	ed image.png
Sep 17 18:58:42 <mawk>	best editor
Sep 17 18:59:05 <Inconvenience>	what ed
Sep 17 18:59:12 <mawk>	ed
Sep 17 18:59:14 <mawk>	the command ed
Sep 17 18:59:17 <Inconvenience>	its like vim?
Sep 17 18:59:19 <teardown>	Inconvenience: you can use exiv2 and exif to dump the metadata. you would need to use something else to strip it
Sep 17 18:59:28 <mawk>	why would you tell him teardown
Sep 17 18:59:32 <mawk>	he's not allowed to do that
Sep 17 18:59:34 <mawk>	he must open with vi
Sep 17 18:59:54 <teardown>	you could use vim -b to open the image in binary mode, yes like mawk says
Sep 17 19:00:06 <mawk>	no -b, that would be too easy
Sep 17 19:00:14 <mawk>	he needs to be punished for asking for spoon feeding
Sep 17 19:00:17 <Inconvenience>	is exi* in the debian repos?
Sep 17 19:00:20 <Inconvenience>	apt get?
Sep 17 19:00:34 <teardown>	Inconvenience: im not sure but probably
Sep 17 19:00:34 <mawk>	type: apt search exif
Sep 17 19:00:57 <mawk>	instead of asking questions about something if you want to learn something today maybe ask questions about how to know something
Sep 17 19:01:56 <teardown>	mawk: yeah, nah wouldn't spoonfeeding be more like 'run this command to strip the personal info'
Sep 17 19:02:43 <teardown>	i just told Inconvenience how to see the metadata which might fuel curiosity
Sep 17 19:05:11 <mawk>	yeah
Sep 17 19:06:14 <SymbioticFemale>	snowden is speaking live on reuters.tv and youtube.com
Sep 17 19:06:28 <Inconvenience>	mawk: stfu?
Sep 17 19:06:48 <Inconvenience>	im asking coz i want to ask
Sep 17 19:06:51 <beanbag->	there's no documentation for pidense I can see
Sep 17 19:06:56 <teardown>	Inconvenience: s/fu/fw/
Sep 17 19:06:59 <Inconvenience>	i know how to use fuking apt
Sep 17 19:07:07 <shibboleth>	i find it very likely that droids and idevices embed artifacts in images that lets those in the know link it to device uuid. location and other metrics may as well be included
Sep 17 19:07:32 <Skripter>	Who likes Kreb on Security
Sep 17 19:08:12 <teardown>	Kreb is kind of an asshole imo
Sep 17 19:10:18 <mawk>	then why are you not using it Inconvenience ? if you know
Sep 17 19:11:15 <Inconvenience>	coz its faster to ask
Sep 17 19:11:21 <mawk>	lol
Sep 17 19:11:37 <Inconvenience>	y the fuk r u questioning me numb nuts
Sep 17 19:11:46 <Inconvenience>	just go about ur business
Sep 17 19:11:59 <mawk>	I'm unemployed sorry
Sep 17 19:13:06 <Inconvenience>	is the note10 any good
Sep 17 19:19:36 <SymbioticFemale>	Inconvenience: ask in ##hardware or something
Sep 17 19:20:28 <Inconvenience>	oh right
Sep 17 19:20:32 <Inconvenience>	ive looked at this before
Sep 17 19:20:48 <SymbioticFemale>	Inconvenience: i liek grapheneOS. you are in ##security btw
Sep 17 19:21:22 <Inconvenience>	is anyone gona put linux on the samsung
Sep 17 19:21:34 <Inconvenience>	or any other phone
Sep 17 19:21:51 <SymbioticFemale>	there is a thing called AnLinux where you can run linux inside a VM in the phone
Sep 17 19:22:04 <SymbioticFemale>	like a full GUI linux, with xfce or something
Sep 17 19:22:18 <SymbioticFemale>	but it runs on top of your android OS
Sep 17 19:22:34 <jabberwock>	much battery. such drain
Sep 17 19:22:39 <Inconvenience>	no
Sep 17 19:22:47 <Inconvenience>	no drain
Sep 17 19:22:54 <Inconvenience>	fkn mac os runs
Sep 17 19:22:55 <mawk>	such explosion
Sep 17 19:22:55 <SymbioticFemale>	WAT
Sep 17 19:23:04 <SymbioticFemale>	Inconvenience: what
Sep 17 19:23:13 <Inconvenience>	ios and windows os
Sep 17 19:23:21 <Inconvenience>	those are way more fat
Sep 17 19:23:57 <Inconvenience>	also gnome is very much phone ready
Sep 17 19:27:34 <Inconvenience>	so how come some of the info in the image is plain text
Sep 17 19:28:08 <Inconvenience>	y dont they garble the whole thing
Sep 17 19:28:22 <teardown>	Inconvenience: what image format
Sep 17 19:28:57 <Inconvenience>	jpg
Sep 17 19:29:22 <jabberwock>	exif data?
Sep 17 19:29:37 <Inconvenience>	no im just looking via vim -b
Sep 17 19:30:40 <mnemon>	probably at the exif data
Sep 17 19:30:47 <teardown>	Inconvenience: jpg uses exif to store metadata. you can read about exif and the jpg file format
Sep 17 19:32:28 <SymbioticFemale>	metadata can be stored in manners other than exif
Sep 17 19:32:33 <SymbioticFemale>	via jpg
Sep 17 19:32:43 <SymbioticFemale>	as has been shown by.... facebook? i forget
Sep 17 19:33:27 *	SymbioticFemale is always paranoid about cameras putting a digital version of printer dots, but SymbioticFemale hasn't heard about it being done so far
Sep 17 19:33:47 <jabberwock>	like steganography?
Sep 17 19:34:46 <jabberwock>	That's a possibility. There's only so much you can store before the image looks totally f'd
Sep 17 19:36:07 <Inconvenience>	lol
Sep 17 19:36:14 <kitties>	it's likely already happening
Sep 17 19:36:29 <Inconvenience>	how bout manners such as NOT USE FACEBOOK?
Sep 17 19:36:32 <kitties>	no reason camera manufacturers aren't adding hidden watermarks
Sep 17 19:37:16 <SymbioticFemale>	kitties: likely.
Sep 17 19:38:50 <SymbioticFemale>	i can't find the link, but someone on twitter posted within the last couple months about finding encoded data added to images uploaded to facebook, presumably as some form of tracking, which did not modify the appearance of the image nor the exif data
Sep 17 19:39:13 <SymbioticFemale>	i *think* it was facebook but i could be misremembering
Sep 17 19:40:13 <Skripter>	I got this interview where they're going to ask me questions about AWS. I'm gonna bomb this shit lmao
Sep 17 19:40:25 <Skripter>	Bomb = fail
Sep 17 19:40:34 <Skripter>	Just in case swat team is on here
Sep 17 19:40:36 *	SymbioticFemale also doesn't know shit about AWS and would bomb it
Sep 17 19:40:53 <teardown>	chilling effect on irc. fuck
Sep 17 19:41:40 <Skripter>	Like, this job depends on me knowing AWS and I only know the basic cloud practitioner shit, all GUI stuff
Sep 17 19:41:50 <Skripter>	I'm doing a 6 hour training course today, so that I can learn more lol
Sep 17 19:42:17 <Skripter>	I'm not saying I'm going to bullshit myself into a job, I'm saying that I'm going to cram what's necessary like a college exam
Sep 17 19:49:45 <Inconvenience>	yeah i dont see any coordinates in here
Sep 17 19:50:03 <Inconvenience>	i was just thinking how bad that would be
Sep 17 19:51:21 <Inconvenience>	coz were all taking pics
Sep 17 19:53:22 <teardown>	clear
Sep 17 19:54:13 <Inconvenience>	what
Sep 17 19:55:31 <Inconvenience>	oh hahaha
Sep 17 19:55:46 <Inconvenience>	it has all kinds of info
Sep 17 19:56:10 <Inconvenience>	cant see that shit w vim obviously
Sep 17 19:56:14 <Inconvenience>	lololololol
Sep 17 19:58:04 <Inconvenience>	only info it dun have is how many cavities i have
Sep 17 19:58:12 <Inconvenience>	wtf
Sep 17 20:31:34 <beanbag->	looks like the us gov threw a temper tantrum at snowden
Sep 17 20:37:53 <nate>	Hm, so seems my issue is despite the system being configured to be a 'legacy' BIOS the distros keep installing w/ EFI shit that wonks it all out
Sep 17 20:40:59 <Kryczek>	nate: what brand of mobo is it?
Sep 17 20:45:15 <nate>	Kryczek: Not even remotely sure, whatever the hell HP throws in their envy's lol
Sep 17 20:45:31 <nate>	I had to post a topic in their community forums to see if anyone knows where they moved all the firmware/software updates to
Sep 17 20:48:43 <Inconvenience>	looks like screenshots png has not exif data
Sep 17 20:49:04 <Inconvenience>	and like no real info in exiv2 either
Sep 17 20:49:47 <Inconvenience>	is that true
Sep 17 20:54:40 <nate>	Inconvenience: For one thing EXIF is a JPEG and TIFF extension mainly.  For another, why would a screenshot, PNG or otherwise have EXIF information?  You may want to look up exactly what EXIF is
Sep 17 21:01:14 <ilikeyou>	Amazon having job fairs today :p  trying to fill 30k positions
Sep 17 21:01:46 <Inconvenience>	just want to make sure it dun have my coords
Sep 17 21:01:52 <Inconvenience>	@nate
Sep 17 21:02:02 <Inconvenience>	nate:
Sep 17 21:02:52 <Inconvenience>	the phones have all kinds of info
Sep 17 21:03:04 <Inconvenience>	although the coords are not precise
Sep 17 21:04:44 <Inconvenience>	i wonder if most ppl realy know about this
Sep 17 21:04:48 <Inconvenience>	or care
Sep 17 21:04:52 <Inconvenience>	and the dangers of it
Sep 17 21:06:51 <nate>	Inconvenience: A general solution to that is don't enable GPS
Sep 17 21:09:56 <Inconvenience>	ya but its a phone
Sep 17 21:12:47 <nate>	so...?
Sep 17 21:13:16 <nate>	Phones get coordinates from GPS, no GPS then no coordinates really
Sep 17 21:13:30 <Inconvenience>	is gps not needed for service?
Sep 17 21:14:03 <Inconvenience>	or do u flip into airplane mode ?
Sep 17 21:14:05 <dylanwtf>	Inconvenience: there is an app for Android called 'Scrambled EXIF', you can share images to it, it will remove EXIF data, then prompt you for an app to share it back to
Sep 17 21:14:18 <dylanwtf>	so you can share from camera, to scrambled exif, to email or wherever
Sep 17 21:14:20 <dylanwtf>	it's in f-droid
Sep 17 21:14:23 <Inconvenience>	dylanwtf: oh great lol
Sep 17 21:14:33 <Inconvenience>	and that app knows where i keep my diamonds
Sep 17 21:14:33 <nate>	Pretty sure the camera apps on most by default will let you disable EXIF for the most part as well, and no GPS is not needed for service
Sep 17 21:14:36 <Inconvenience>	fuk that
Sep 17 21:14:38 <nate>	cellular service does not go over GPS
Sep 17 21:14:43 <Inconvenience>	and fuk that app lol
Sep 17 21:14:52 <Inconvenience>	nate: right
Sep 17 21:15:01 <Inconvenience>	man...
Sep 17 21:15:11 <Inconvenience>	gps should only be used by fkn maps
Sep 17 21:15:16 <Inconvenience>	but no
Sep 17 21:15:24 <Inconvenience>	they fkn collect that shit all over
Sep 17 21:15:40 <dylanwtf>	you want to strip other data too like camera info and shit
Sep 17 21:15:50 <Inconvenience>	right
Sep 17 21:15:58 <Inconvenience>	iphone has so much shit in here
Sep 17 21:16:18 <Inconvenience>	although its not really private
Sep 17 21:16:21 <nate>	lol using an apple product and EXIF information is what you're concerned about?
Sep 17 21:16:24 <nate>	Oh you poor soul
Sep 17 21:16:24 <Inconvenience>	cept the coords
Sep 17 21:16:28 <Inconvenience>	which are inacurate
Sep 17 21:16:43 <Inconvenience>	i am a poor soul
Sep 17 21:16:49 <Inconvenience>	swo
Sep 17 21:16:52 <Inconvenience>	so
Sep 17 21:17:18 <Inconvenience>	is note10 any good?
Sep 17 21:17:32 <Inconvenience>	which phone shud i get?
Sep 17 21:20:51 <NetTerminalGene>	today a book from edward snowed named permanent record will be released
Sep 17 21:24:14 <jabberwock>	Anyone know the specific section in PCI-DSS that talks against SSN fields being of type "text" instead of "password"?
Sep 17 21:24:23 <dylanwtf>	Inconvenience: a pixel device with an aosp rom on it
Sep 17 21:24:33 <dylanwtf>	grapheneos would be a good choice
Sep 17 21:24:44 <Inconvenience>	oh google pixel?
Sep 17 21:25:22 <dylanwtf>	yeah, the 4 is probably going to come out soon, then after that graphene should support it given a bit of time
Sep 17 21:25:28 <dylanwtf>	if you were willing to wait on a new phone
Sep 17 21:25:30 <Inconvenience>	fuk google
Sep 17 21:25:41 <Inconvenience>	those fools cant make phones
Sep 17 21:25:48 <dylanwtf>	but if you go to a google-less rom your phone would be crippled in the eyes of a lot of people
Sep 17 21:25:49 <Inconvenience>	stick to making crappy websites
Sep 17 21:26:14 <dylanwtf>	if you do it right you don't install tracking apps like facebook, netflix, spotify, all that shit
Sep 17 21:26:35 <dylanwtf>	so you use web apps mostly
Sep 17 21:26:37 <Inconvenience>	lool
Sep 17 21:26:44 <Inconvenience>	ie all apps?
Sep 17 21:26:49 <Inconvenience>	what a fkn nitemare
Sep 17 21:26:57 <dylanwtf>	not really
Sep 17 21:27:20 <Pilate>	spotify can have my data in exchange for more good music
Sep 17 21:27:22 <dylanwtf>	most of the ad and tracking infested shit is for entertainment anyway
Sep 17 21:27:49 <dylanwtf>	i run spotify on the head unit in my car and just tether my phone via wifi
Sep 17 21:28:11 <SeepingN_>	which unit does this?
Sep 17 21:28:25 <ilikeyou>	just saw the Asus ROG 2 phone the other day. that thing has the power of a mid tier netbook. 4GB ddr4.
Sep 17 21:28:30 <dylanwtf>	tonnes of chinese ones you can get on amazon and ebay
Sep 17 21:28:38 <SeepingN_>	oh
Sep 17 21:28:40 <Inconvenience>	Pilate: that makes no sense
Sep 17 21:28:55 <Inconvenience>	its not a fkn bazar
Sep 17 21:29:08 <SeepingN_>	it just IS bizarre
Sep 17 21:29:23 <Inconvenience>	no like a bazar
Sep 17 21:29:37 <Inconvenience>	like a middle eastern market place
Sep 17 21:29:45 <dylanwtf>	Inconvenience: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/
Sep 17 21:29:50 <dylanwtf>	this is the 'app store' i use
Sep 17 21:30:11 <Inconvenience>	fuk droids must be a mess
Sep 17 21:30:19 <Inconvenience>	at least apple its all one source
Sep 17 21:30:33 <dylanwtf>	i mean i'm not using my phone normally
Sep 17 21:30:37 <Inconvenience>	there needs to be a linux phone
Sep 17 21:30:40 <dylanwtf>	most people just use the playstore
Sep 17 21:30:42 <CPngN>	there was
Sep 17 21:30:46 <Inconvenience>	like a debian phone
Sep 17 21:30:47 <CPngN>	oh so briefly
Sep 17 21:30:49 <dylanwtf>	pinephone or librem 5, both coming soon
Sep 17 21:30:49 <Inconvenience>	w all the shit
Sep 17 21:30:50 <CPngN>	ubuntu
Sep 17 21:30:54 <Inconvenience>	and terminal
Sep 17 21:31:21 <Inconvenience>	and opensource
Sep 17 21:31:38 <Inconvenience>	otherwise who knows what they are doing
Sep 17 21:31:52 <dylanwtf>	you're gonna have the same problem there though, you think your bank, or netflix or whoever is gonna give you a kde plasma app or whatever?
Sep 17 21:32:20 <dylanwtf>	if they ever do it won't be for a long time
Sep 17 21:32:41 <dylanwtf>	but i'll definitely pick up a pinephone or librem 5, looks sick
Sep 17 21:35:31 <Inconvenience>	is the note10 good
Sep 17 21:37:14 <beanbag->	nate
Sep 17 21:37:17 <calmclam>	wow firefox moving to 4 week release cycle
Sep 17 21:37:21 <beanbag->	message me tonight when I am home
Sep 17 21:37:25 <beanbag->	I will help with the bios thing
Sep 17 21:37:30 <calmclam>	inb4 firefox version 507
Sep 17 21:39:06 <nate>	beanbag-: Unfortunately apparently the only way to update teh BIOS on this is an .exe patcher, so I have to reinstall windows lol
Sep 17 21:39:11 <nate>	unless they're hiding a .bin file somewhere
Sep 17 21:40:07 <nate>	I had someone in the forums say to try and do UEFI w/ secure boot again because "it should work fine", and the system is even worse now, the F9 device chooser doesn't even show any devices in UEFI mode lol, but in legacy mode it will show all devices w/ both UEFI and non-UEFI options.  This thing is a disaster
Sep 17 21:41:31 <nate>	jabberwock: PCI-DSS literally has nothing to do with SSN's, it's a financial/card regulation enforced by card vendors
Sep 17 21:41:44 <jabberwock>	I think SSN should be in scope for PCI though.
Sep 17 21:41:48 <nate>	That said some nations have PII laws that might regulate stuff like that
Sep 17 21:42:13 <nate>	Not at all, it's not credit/debit card related (and in most cases likely isn't even going to be used in conjunction with CC numbers)
Sep 17 21:42:14 <jabberwock>	If you're applying for a credit card and it asks you for your SSN then I feel that falls into scope
Sep 17 21:43:06 <nate>	Not really as SSN's are generally optional for that process and it should never be saved to begin with, simply used quickly for the credit check
Sep 17 21:44:12 <nate>	(of course not providing an SSN is probably gonna get you rejected unless you have a really REALLY unique name and DOB)
Sep 17 21:45:11 <nate>	I'm trying to remember what the name of the US legal acts are that are relevant to this
