T 1568582082 18<phogg18>	digital-_-mystik: it does not need to be +x, but it needs to be sh compatible. It will be sourced. The prefix on the name determines the order. Your WM starts in a file prefixed with 99, so you need to have your own file come before that
T 1568582095 18<phogg18>	digital-_-mystik: since all letters come after all numbers that means a numeric prefix

T 1568643884 18<ALowther18>	drzacek: You can compile your own kernel and then take everything else the distro has to offer and piece it together?
T 1568643901 18<drzacek18>	ALowther, of course
T 1568643940 18<jim18>	inad922, I guess you could sort them, then print the first few numbers until it's less than certain number
T 1568644019 18<ALowther18>	drzacek: I did not know that. That's good to know. The way I look at an OS - which is maybe a bit naive, it's just the best understanding I have at the moment - is that it consists of a kernel and the packages to interact with it(the kernel) and files/resources....So I can compile my own kernel and then choose, from whichever distribution I want, what I consider to be the best maintained packages and then piece those together?
T 1568644063 18<jim18>	inad922, are the numbers arranged in some kind of tabular form?
T 1568644068 18<mgolisch18>	sure but why even do that? the distro packaged kernels usualy work fine
T 1568644121 18<vai18>	compile to make it work on ISA 486 box
T 1568644302 18<drzacek18>	ALowther, other way around, you choose the distro that appeals to you/you think is the best, and if the provided kernel is not for you, you either compile yourself or look for other versions
T 1568644337 18<spomata18>	hi all, I'm creating a script to run some EDA tools (electronic design) and I've noticed some process is turning off echo in the bash console, leaving it off at the exit. Is there a way to track which process is responsible for it / preventing it from happening altogether? The script is basically a python script kicking some subprocesses
T 1568644405 18<drzacek18>	ALowther, in essence you are right - an OS IS a kernel with shell and programs, but compiling of the linux kernel is relatively easy, while managing the system as a whole is more complex, keeping track of installed software, if dependencies are met, etc etc.
T 1568644579 18<ALowther18>	drzacek: But with a system always being limited by the kernel, the ability to easily compile whichever version of the kernel you want is incredible and then from there take advantage of whichever distro gives you the programs you want?
T 1568644630 18<drzacek18>	depends on how you define "limited by". All the higher system functions are realized by other programs
T 1568644662 18<drzacek18>	also, maybe important thing to consider when choosing (at least for some), do you want systemd or not

T 1568644749 18<drzacek18>	yeah
T 1568644765 18<drzacek18>	though finding a systemd-less distro might be hard, especially among bigger ones
T 1568644785 18<akk18>	There are lots of systemd-free distros.
T 1568644797 18<drzacek18>	akk, any major ones that offer that out of the box?
T 1568644832 18<akk18>	drzacek: No, as far as I know all the major distros use systemd, and then people make systemd-free forks of them
T 1568644847 18<akk18>	or else you use a major distro and install a different init package, which I know you can do in debian
T 1568644847 18<drzacek18>	akk, exactly
T 1568644856 18<akk18>	I can only assume it's equally easy on the other majors.
T 1568644860 18<drzacek18>	well I'm fine with systemd for now
T 1568644870 18*	akk hasn't actually done this, but is on LUG lists with lots of people who do
T 1568644878 18<drzacek18>	but I know there was quite evangelical discussion about this some time ago
T 1568644891 18<akk18>	I don't see the point of a linux newbie avoiding systemd, that's sort of an esoteric thing to do anyway.
T 1568644902 18<drzacek18>	I agree
T 1568644904 18<ALowther18>	drzacek: So, I see Buster ships with 4.19 - if you wanted, you could compile the latest kernel on your own, replace the provided 4.19 and leave all else the same?
T 1568644916 18<drzacek18>	exactly
T 1568644927 18<drzacek18>	but is there any reason for you to replace the 4.19?
T 1568644937 18<tds18>	if you were happy with it, you could also grab 5.2 from buster-backports :)
T 1568644941 18<akk18>	ALowther: You can even have lots of different kernels installed on the same system, and reboot into whichever one you're in the mood for.
T 1568644947 18<akk18>	(I'm not sure why you'd do that, but you could)
T 1568644978 18<drzacek18>	akk, well, if filesystem is not unmounted properly, that's usually the first thing that gets borked
T 1568644983 18<ALowther18>	drzacek: Not that I know of - I'm more speaking from a perspective of what is possible rather than from what I am going to go do. I couldn't tell you the difference between what is included in 4.19 vs 5.x to make an educated decision to replace it. If I did, it would just be for a learning experience.
T 1568644983 18*	akk hasn't compiled a kernel in maybe 7 years, there's always some distro kernel that works well enough
T 1568644988 18<drzacek18>	so booting to other kernel is a chance to boot into broken system
T 1568645025 18<drzacek18>	well, there's some fun in compiling kernel, surely nice to learn stuff, and you get some nerd points
T 1568645033 18<drzacek18>	but if you don't need it, stick with what distro provides
T 1568645039 18<drzacek18>	it's usually the fool-proof solution
T 1568645042 18<akk18>	Usually if you're compiling a kernel, it's because you have some special experimental driver or scheduler or something that you want to use.
T 1568645043 18<jim18>	inad922, or do you mean fields whose number is larger than a certain number? and you wouldn't need to sort if it's that
T 1568645047 18<akik18>	spomata: bpftrace can show you all processes executed on your system
T 1568645064 18<akk18>	(or, of course, you just want to learn how to compile a kernel, which is certainly a valid reason too)
T 1568645065 18<drzacek18>	also I think by sticking to the official kernel, you get security updates in casethey find some problems, while on custom kernel you're on your own
T 1568645135 18<drzacek18>	well if you don't break your linux system at least few times in the beginning, to the point that only format helps, are you even trying?
T 1568645149 18<akk18>	haha yeah
T 1568645155 18<drzacek18>	I know my first experiences were just that - I wanted to learn linux the hard way, but rather being humble I went #yolo
T 1568645163 18<jim18>	(there was a time when compiling your own kernel was required, possibly to get support for some device, or filesystem)
T 1568645169 18<drzacek18>	"what do you mean I can't do that and need root rights?"

T 1568645203 18<akk18>	"what do you mean I should be cautious in what I do as root?"
T 1568645205 18<jim18>	drzacek, chown is a root-only operation
T 1568645234 18<drzacek18>	I think I was 14yo then? I knew I was extremely annoyed by the fact I wasn't able to do anything
T 1568645250 18<jim18>	drzacek, and, that particular invocation of chown will destroy your system
T 1568645264 18<drzacek18>	and while I could switch to root in terminal, my file manager couldn't copy/move/remove things, so I wanted to make it easier for me :D
T 1568645267 18<akk18>	I thought that was drzacek's point
T 1568645275 18<drzacek18>	jim, that exactly what happened
T 1568645300 18<drzacek18>	tbh it didn't even chowned the whole /, it stopped working mid through

T 1568645371 18<drzacek18>	can't say, it was over 10 years ago
T 1568645385 18<jim18>	well with some dists, you can tell it to format or to not format
T 1568645385 18<drzacek18>	damn, closer to 20 than 10

T 1568738352 18<akk18>	OTOH, android is very happy to kill apps at any time, so it could just kill any app that has an open file on the removable storage.

T 1568747787 18<Dagmar18>	Depending on what type of cert it is, both webservers and mail servers may be able to use it, whcih also changes things
T 1568747802 18<Dagmar18>	So you have to specify WHAT THE CERT IS before anyone's going to be able to give you more useful information

T 1568748256 18<lupine18>	I don't use those any more, I have a web server that requests its own ssl certs
T 1568748266 18<M6HZ18>	lupine, are you saying that there is no standard? :)
T 1568748267 18<roomba18>	there is a lot of variation across distros - and nobody really knows what to do with certs on their distro of choice either

T 1568748282 18<lupine18>	I thjen use cronjobs to distribute the certificates it gets to other daemons (like mail), again, at configurable locations

T 1568748327 18<lupine18>	e.g. I have /etc/exim4/exim.crt which is a copy of the certificate my web server gets

T 1568749054 18<Guest9249418>	Let's say I am starting a X app from terminal and it keeps printing some output. Is there a way to pipe & monitor this output with for example combination of xargs watch grep ?
T 1568749080 18<Sleaker18>	hmm so I've got a server running x on :0, and an ltsp client setup that's getting a session from that server, it's display gets set to IP:7 - I'm trying to run xdotool to minimize a window on the client display. the command works fine if it actually gets run from a terminal on the client, but doesn't work when run from the main server even if I force override the DISPLAY env variable.
T 1568749107 18<M6HZ18>	lupine, So, from what I understand, I should either place them wherever I want, or in /etc/distrib-specific-dir ?
T 1568749187 18<section118>	Sleaker, maybe something relate to xhost
T 1568749250 18<section118>	Sleaker, you can try for testing run xhost + on the client ...then try the coomand on the server.

T 1568749655 18<Sleaker18>	section1: hmm xhost on the client doesn't do anything, as it has no x server.
