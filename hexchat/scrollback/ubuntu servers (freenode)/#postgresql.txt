T 1567243514 18<xocolatl18>	dob1: you cannot use the alias in an expression
T 1567243533 18<xocolatl18>	dob1: so you need  WHERE ricerca ->> 'nome' = 'test'
T 1567243601 18<dob118>	xocolatl, ok thanks
T 1567244931 18<BigFoot45518>	How can you explain an increase of buffer hits for an index-scan after some columns are removed? I expected that after removing two columns (one var and one timestamp) the whole table will consist of less database pages and therefore lead to less buffer hits in the index scan.
T 1567244966 18<BigFoot45518>	The query I'm executing is executed completely in memory.
T 1567245002 18<BigFoot45518>	And after this "optimization" the query is minimal slower than before.
T 1567245172 18<BigFoot45518>	The query itself didn't change. The columns were just useless for this query.
T 1567245207 18<incognito18>	BigFoot455: what did you change in the index ?
T 1567245257 18<xocolatl18>	BigFoot455: removing columns doesn't actually remove the columns from existing data
T 1567245273 18<BigFoot45518>	Nothing on the index. I just dropped two columns from the table, that were not used in the query or any indices.
T 1567245316 18<incognito18>	the index scan buffer hits is only for the index_tuple
T 1567245323 18<xocolatl18>	cool, so that's kind of important information that you should provide
T 1567245329 18<xocolatl18>	did you do a normal vacuum after that?
T 1567245351 18<BigFoot45518>	Normal vacuum after the full vacuum?
T 1567245359 18<incognito18>	if it increases after a query, maybe more pages of your index are cached in the shared buffer
T 1567245359 18<xocolatl18>	yes
T 1567245363 18<BigFoot45518>	No. Is this necessary?
T 1567245376 18<xocolatl18>	it is necessary, yes
T 1567245382 18<BigFoot45518>	Why?
T 1567245390 18<xocolatl18>	several reasons
T 1567245429 18<xocolatl18>	the main ones are to recreate the visibility map and free space map
T 1567245504 18<BigFoot45518>	I thought a full vacuum, does everything a "normal" vacuum does, but first rewrites the whole table.
T 1567245520 18<xocolatl18>	nope
T 1567245522 18<incognito18>	BigFoot455: wanna show the explain and the query ?
T 1567245610 18<BigFoot45518>	Alright let me try with an additional vacuum then.
T 1567245648 18<BigFoot45518>	I can uploaded, but just the obfuscated version. One second.
T 1567245670 18<xocolatl18>	BigFoot455: don't bother with an obfuscated version
T 1567245701 18<xocolatl18>	if your table names are that important, you should hire a consultant agency and sign an nda with them
T 1567245857 18<BigFoot45518>	Thing is that I didn't talk to my supervisor, whether company is okay with sharing the queries on the internet. So that's what I can do for now.

T 1567245954 18<RhodiumToad18>	and what was the plan before?
T 1567245985 18<BigFoot45518>	As you can see the "optimized" query has about 20k more buffer hits than before.
T 1567246023 18<BigFoot45518>	This is the before plan. There should be a link to the "optimized" query. At least for me there is. I used the "Add optimization" feature.
T 1567246099 18<BigFoot45518>	One question in between: I see you guys somehow referencing my nickname all the time. How can I do this?
T 1567246119 18<xocolatl18>	just type it
T 1567246172 18<xocolatl18>	you didn't vacuum
T 1567246283 18<RhodiumToad18>	BigFoot455: so your two queries are not exactly the same?
T 1567246311 18<Rembane18>	BigFoot455: If you have a reasonable client you can type the two first letter of the nick you want to hilight and press TAB and then it will autocomplete.
T 1567246320 18<BigFoot45518>	xocolatl: I didn't vacuum. I need to setup my database again, because I tried some other stuff meanwhile.
T 1567246352 18<BigFoot45518>	Rembane: Yes it works. thanks ;).
T 1567246382 18<RhodiumToad18>	this clause: ((quebec_seven five NOT NULL) OR (quebec_seven five NULL))  appears only in one of the queries
T 1567246408 18<Rembane18>	BigFoot455: No worries, welcome to IRC. :)
T 1567246430 18<RhodiumToad18>	(I grant you, that should not affect the result)
T 1567246439 18<BigFoot45518>	RhodiumToad: I did some minor adjustments. Like removing this tautology.
T 1567246513 18<RhodiumToad18>	what else did you change?
T 1567246684 18<BigFoot45518>	RhodiumToad: In the query? Nothing.
T 1567246709 18<RhodiumToad18>	see, I get suspicious when people say that
T 1567246722 18<RhodiumToad18>	especially when they said it before and have just been proved wrong
T 1567246786 18<RhodiumToad18>	is the order of items the same in that ANY clause?
T 1567247032 18<BigFoot45518>	Except for some whitespace changes and the tautology, I can confirm that nothing changed. I just double checked.
T 1567247040 18<BigFoot45518>	Same. Yes.
T 1567247303 18<BigFoot45518>	Okay. So after removing the columns I'll run VACUUM FULL, then VACUUM and then ANALYZE.
T 1567248753 18<m1chael18>	hello. I am trying to use pg_dump... when i'm logged in to the postgres user, doing pg_dump works, however pg_dump -h localhost or pg_dump -h 127.0.0.1 produces an error: FATAL:  Ident authentication failed for user "postgres"  # i know the short answer would be to remove the -h host switch, but can anyone explain why this doesn't work and how i can fix it so that it works with -h localhost ?
T 1567248927 18<dennis_18>	m1chael: your pg_hba.conf file decide how auth is handled, in your case when you don't use -h it uses a "local" line in the pg_hba.conf and with -h it uses some other line
T 1567248948 18<m1chael18>	ah
T 1567249008 18<m1chael18>	i just got something unrelated working after 1 year of troubleshooting, so this one sounds easy
T 1567249443 18<dennisb18>	You probably have a line stating that when you come from 127.0.0.1 it should use the "ident" method. If you change it to "md5" or "scram-sha-256" it will ask you for a password. If you set it to "trust" it will let you in, no questions asked, but that's probably not the security you want.
T 1567249539 18<m1chael18>	i'm going to modify the script to leave out -h since i'll be running this from the pg user on a crontab... after i get this working i'd like to look at Barman
T 1567249630 18<RhodiumToad18>	"ident" should generally not be used on "host" lines since it uses an external identd server, which (a) you probably don't have running, (b) you probably should not run, and (c) isn't all that secure anyway
T 1567249655 18<DrAgOn_18>	CiauuuZ!!!!!!!
T 1567249674 18<RhodiumToad18>	whut
T 1567253878 18<BigFoot45518>	So I run the query now again, after executing VACUUM (after VACUUM FULL). The result is the same. With the smaller table about 20k more buffer hits are counted.
T 1567254004 18<RhodiumToad18>	which table exactly did you vacuum?
T 1567254035 18<BigFoot45518>	The table that I columns I dropped.
T 1567254098 18<RhodiumToad18>	yes but which one is it in the query
T 1567254280 18<BigFoot45518>	Is it possible, that due to the dropped columns, the rows are organized less efficient in the database pages for this query? Another query shows a performance boost (a query that has about 600k less buffer reads after dropping columns)
T 1567254343 18<RhodiumToad18>	dropping the columns doesn't move any data. the vacuum full afterwards did, but any effect on the efficiency would be pure chance
T 1567254376 18<BigFoot45518>	RhodiumToad: the "juliet yankee_golf" table.
T 1567255489 18<RhodiumToad18>	BigFoot455: the number of buffer hits for an index scan may vary slightly depending on the order in which rows are visited. not sure if this would explain what you see
T 1567255524 18<RhodiumToad18>	for example, if it visits a row on block 1, then one on block 2, then one on block 1, that would be three hits, but 1,1,2 would be two hits
T 1567255614 18<RhodiumToad18>	("hit" is incremented by taking a pin on a buffer that didn't need to be read in, but there's an optimization whereby if the scan's last tuple was on the same block as the current one, it reuses the old pin rather than taking a new one)
T 1567255846 18<unclechu18>	hello. what actually `select into` does? does it really creates a new table?
T 1567255876 18<unclechu18>	can i somehow mark such a shortcut to be automatically removed what transaction is commited?
T 1567255992 18<RhodiumToad18>	select into  as a plain sql statement, or in plpgsql? they are different
T 1567256015 18<RhodiumToad18>	select into  in plain sql is just another way to write  create table ... as select ...
T 1567256028 18<RhodiumToad18>	if that's what you want, you can use  create temp table ... as select ...
T 1567256109 18<BigFoot45518>	RhodiumToad: could be an explanation. Even though on average I'd expect the order to become more efficient. Maybe for this query it's just unfortunate.
T 1567256136 18<unclechu18>	RhodiumToad: in `psql` repl
T 1567256183 18<RhodiumToad18>	unclechu: then use  CREATE TEMP TABLE x ON COMMIT DROP AS SELECT ...;   and "x" will be dropped on commit
T 1567256185 18<unclechu18>	RhodiumToad: is there any difference between `create temp table ... as select ...` and `with` statement?
T 1567256210 18<RhodiumToad18>	unclechu: yes, they're completely different things
T 1567256226 18<unclechu18>	RhodiumToad: what would be more efficient in context of memory and performance?
T 1567256228 18<RhodiumToad18>	create temp table as select  actually creates a new temp table, that you can't access in the same query
T 1567256244 18<RhodiumToad18>	but which you can access in following queries, create indexes on, etc.
T 1567256256 18<unclechu18>	i assumet `with` would work better? since it probably doesn't create such a big structure but doing it on the fly?
T 1567256299 18<RhodiumToad18>	until pg12 (not out yet), WITH actually materializes a copy of the query result, in memory up to work_mem and then spilling to disk
T 1567256330 18<RhodiumToad18>	it's more efficient in some ways, but it has the problem that you can't create indexes on the WITH result, which can be an issue
T 1567256354 18<unclechu18>	RhodiumToad: thanks a lot, now it's a lot more clear for me
T 1567256522 18<BigFoot45518>	RhodiumToad: Also thanks from me :)
T 1567258277 18<dennisb18>	So, shouldn't --data-checksums be the default for initdb? Do you people use checksums in production?
T 1567258811 18<Zr4018>	dennisb: I'd want to, but since this is production this will have to wait until we decide to upgrade from 9.4
T 1567258856 18<Zr4018>	at previous $work I did enable it as part of upgrading to 10
T 1567260554 18<Foxfir318>	troule connection with php. installed the php postgres module. guessing that takes care of the postgres side, but php has no idea. build in php server says: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function pg_connect()

T 1567261007 18<wkalt18>	those tables don't seem like they should overlap to me
T 1567263181 18<xocolatl18>	wkalt: the overlap condition is the high end of the first partition compared with the low end of the second partition.  the condition expands like this:  1 > 1 OR (1 = 1 AND '2019-01-01' > '2019-01-02') OR (1 = 1 AND '2019-01-01' = '2019-01-02' AND 2 > 1)
T 1567263187 18<xocolatl18>	which is false, so they overlap
T 1567263208 18<RhodiumToad18>	why is it false?
T 1567263214 18<RhodiumToad18>	actually the problem is more subtle
T 1567263222 18<xocolatl18>	which one of those conditions is true?
T 1567263255 18<RhodiumToad18>	oh yeah
T 1567263308 18<RhodiumToad18>	anyway, if retention_policy is to be used to decide which partition it goes in, that has to come before the date
T 1567263366 18<wkalt18>	yeah, that's what I'm seeing experimentally. Thanks for confirming.
T 1567263401 18<RhodiumToad18>	remember that (1,1,2) comes between (1,1,1) and (1,2,1)
T 1567263460 18<wkalt18>	if that's the way to think about it, makes plenty sense
T 1567263506 18<xocolatl18>	switching upload_time and retention_policy give: (1 > 1) OR (1 = 1 AND 2 > 1) OR (1 = 1 AND 2 = 1 AND '2019-01-01' > '2019-01-02')
T 1567263512 18<xocolatl18>	and that one has a true condition
T 1567263554 18<xocolatl18>	in other news, it is very likely that upload_time should actually be of type timestamptz

T 1567596020 18<[Terra]18>	Hi all, I'd like your opinion. Am I right in that I try to minimize the number of idle connections to my postgres servers?
T 1567596169 18<Myon18>	these don't hurt that much
T 1567596181 18<Myon18>	you really want to minimize idle *in transaction*
T 1567596194 18<Myon18>	really idle connections just consume some RAM
T 1567596199 18<[Terra]18>	Well, developers here think it's good for their performance to write a daemon that opens 5 (or more) connections to postgres, issue several 'prepare statements' in it, and then they sit and wait for connection from their webfrontend.
T 1567596211 18<Myon18>	yes, that's standard practise
T 1567596213 18<[Terra]18>	For every app they write.
T 1567596227 18<Myon18>	and 5 is usually fine, unless you have 100 of these
T 1567596236 18<[Terra]18>	So I have hundreds of connections that do nothing.
T 1567596282 18<Myon18>	can you ask them to make that number configurable, and then set it to 2 in the config?
T 1567596325 18<Berge18>	And/or consider using a proxy such as pgbouncer.
T 1567596348 18<Berge18>	If you have considerable more connections to postgres than you have CPU cores (or IO subsystem to support the load), things will slow down.
T 1567596393 18<[Terra]18>	I'd live to move them to pgbouncer, but in their current setup it won't work since they expect that several 'prepare statements' handlers do exist.
T 1567596431 18<Berge18>	[Terra]: Why wouldn't it work?
T 1567596470 18<[Terra]18>	When pgbouncer closes the connection, the prepared statement is gone.
T 1567596531 18<[Terra]18>	And yes, I've tried asking them to lower the intial number of connections too.
T 1567596544 18<Berge18>	[Terra]: Depends on the pooling mode.
T 1567596594 18<Berge18>	(Why are they using PREPARE?)
T 1567596635 18<[Terra]18>	I've also suggested that they'd use a function instead of prepare statement
T 1567596803 18<[Terra]18>	It is manageble now, but I feel that all those idle connections are a waste of resources on the postgres server.
T 1567596826 18<Berge18>	Not if they just idle.
T 1567596837 18<Berge18>	Prepared statements aren't used for the same things as functions, though?
T 1567596963 18<mobidrop18>	they do take up connections so if you hit the max it'll block
T 1567596967 18<[Terra]18>	Isn't it so that for every connection at least 'work_mem' is reserved? Of is that work_mem not allocated until it is used?
T 1567597055 18<Myon18>	the latter, and it's even freed again immediately after each query
T 1567597064 18<Zr4018>	work_mem is actually a limit for plan nodes, so one connection can in fact use work_mem multiple times
T 1567597074 18<Myon18>	the memory usage is for internal caches ("which tables have I seen yet")
T 1567597132 18<[Terra]18>	Myon: Ah, ok. In that case it is much less of a problem than I thought.
T 1567597156 18<Myon18>	a typical number would be something like 16MB per persistent backend
T 1567597165 18<Myon18>	but it could be more if there's many tables/objects
T 1567597175 18<[Terra]18>	And by query I assume you mean transaction.

T 1567597190 18<[Terra]18>	ok
T 1567597196 18<Myon18>	there's per-transaction memory as well, but that's usually less
T 1567597217 18<Myon18>	"select from foo order by bar" needs memory to sort in the *query*
T 1567597227 18<Zr4018>	previous $work database, which had terrible partitioning and long-lived connections, saw the syscache grow to ridiculous size
T 1567597333 18<[Terra]18>	So, an idle connection only eats one connection out of max_connections, but doesn't hurt much otherwise?
T 1567597359 18<Zr4018>	right
T 1567597366 18<Myon18>	plus it's a process that eats host RAM
T 1567597385 18<Myon18>	if you don't have RAM to have 1000 processes of that size, it's a problem
T 1567597444 18<[Terra]18>	Yes, but the code of those processes should be shared as well.
T 1567597493 18<Myon18>	the shared libraries are, the syscache is not
T 1567597529 18<Myon18>	just look at a PostgreSQL server that has been running for some time and check the RES column in ps/top
T 1567597534 18<[Terra]18>	Ah yes, and the syscache is where "which tables have I seen yet" is stored?

T 1567600549 18<Myon18>	or start the generated IDs at 1, it'll be some time until they conflict with the timestamps
T 1567600564 18<Myon18>	somewhat ugly, but should work
T 1567600674 18<[patrik]18>	or you could decode those unix-magic timestamps...are they only epoch timestamps or are there some more magic applied?
T 1567600759 18<[patrik]18>	if they are just epoch timestamps you can keep generating such ids

T 1567609838 18<[patrik]18>	anykey: well i wouldnt say job queueing, but listen/notify can send a payload to a client. thing is if you read about it you'll see that it contains a few gotchas, but it might be useful in a scenario like yours.

T 1567774996 18<Siecje18>	I had a deadlock from this code. https://dpaste.de/dQYL Why would a transaction depend on another transaction?
T 1567775127 18<Myon18>	the typical situation is that you are updating rows 1 and 2, and some other transaction is updating rows 2 and 1
T 1567775135 18<Myon18>	both will then have to wait for each other
T 1567775177 18<Myon18>	this section hash sounds like it would update several rows
T 1567775423 18<RhodiumToad18>	transactions wait for other transactions as part of the row-level locking mechanism
T 1567775469 18<RhodiumToad18>	in order to allow unlimited numbers of row locks to be used, row locks are recorded in the tuple header of the locked row, by the transactionid of the locking transaction (or a multixact id for a group of transactions)
T 1567775495 18<RhodiumToad18>	when one transaction waits on a row lock, it finds the id of the blocking transaction and waits for it to end
T 1567775502 18<Siecje18>	Is row level locking the default?
T 1567775537 18<Siecje18>	Myon: Updating the hash reads fields but only modifies one column for each section.
T 1567775640 18<RhodiumToad18>	row-level locking is used in all update and delete operations, all FK checks, and all select for [key share|share|no key update|update] operations
T 1567775753 18<Siecje18>	So two updates to the same record in different transactions will lock forever?
T 1567775791 18<Myon18>	on a single row, the second update will wait for the first to finish
T 1567775807 18<Myon18>	the deadlock happens if you have several rows updated in different order
T 1567775836 18<Siecje18>	So I should update sections in the same order?
T 1567775847 18<Siecje18>	What if one has more records?
T 1567775894 18<RhodiumToad18>	what exactly are you updating?
T 1567776201 18<dob118>	hi, is there an index that can I apply to a text column to improve search via ~* operator?
T 1567776210 18<dob118>	I have the index on lower(col) now
T 1567776335 18<RhodiumToad18>	what sort of regexp are you searching on?
T 1567776346 18<RhodiumToad18>	a pg_trgm index will help a bit in some cases

T 1568042507 18<rivyn18>	ok, how does swap factor in?

T 1568042539 18<RhodiumToad18>	so by default, with overcommit_ratio at 50%, you're limited to swap + half of ram
T 1568042578 18<RhodiumToad18>	I would increase swap size to at least RAM size, as well as increasing overcommit_ratio

T 1568074741 18<xocolatl18>	hey RhodiumToad, do you remember a while ago I asked about C-level scanning through an index or seqscan?  you said only CLUSTER made a clumsy decision about that and I should go through SPI.  I just found systable_beginscan (in src/backend/access/index/genam.c) that seems to do what I was looking for.
T 1568074748 18<ningu18>	so how would you handle that case? you have records that are basically freely defined key/value pairs, and you need to store them (associated with some more regularly structured data), and you need to query to see if any value matches
T 1568074764 18<ningu18>	RhodiumToad: I mean something like EAV can do it, I just know everyone says no (and I understand why)
T 1568074813 18<RhodiumToad18>	xocolatl: that only seqscans when forced to
T 1568074868 18<ningu18>	well honestly, it wouldn't be that hard to denormalize and add a field that has a concatenation of all the values
T 1568074896 18<ningu18>	and just use it for matching, then use the actual data (in json) for display
T 1568075013 18<ningu18>	RhodiumToad: is that maybe the least bad option for this?
T 1568075029 18<ningu18>	could use trgm index maybe
T 1568075033 18<RhodiumToad18>	depends what the objective is
T 1568075058 18<ningu18>	the objective is mainly to determine, "does any value of these key/value pairs contain the given search term(s)?"
T 1568075074 18<RhodiumToad18>	yes, but why
T 1568075148 18<ningu18>	each set of key/value pairs is a dictionary entry. there's a word in some language being described, and its translation into english or similar major language. but there can be a lot of fields like gloss, definition, etymology, notes, etc. the search will be for someone saying, give me all the words in the database that contain the word "drink" somewhere in their entry
T 1568075160 18<ningu18>	we need to preserve the original structure of the entry in case the user wants to inspect it manually
T 1568075180 18<ningu18>	we will extract as much regular data as possible but that will be limited by the way these are structured
T 1568075231 18<RhodiumToad18>	where "drink" is matches exactly as a word, or stemmed tsearch-style, or matched by substrings?
T 1568075257 18<ningu18>	yeah, I thought of that. matches exactly as a word is definitely the simplest case and probably all we need to support.
T 1568075276 18<ningu18>	it would be a regex where the word is flanked by \b, or similar.
T 1568075286 18<ningu18>	so like it would match "drink-water" but not "drinking"
T 1568075294 18<RhodiumToad18>	have a function that returns a flat list of all the words in the entry as an array, and index that too
T 1568075307 18<ningu18>	hmm... ok
T 1568075318 18<ningu18>	so it will come down to just whether the array contains the word, cool
T 1568075342 18<ningu18>	that would work well
T 1568075353 18<ningu18>	what about the stemming case, just curious?
T 1568075419 18<RhodiumToad18>	well then you'd return it as a tsvector not an array
T 1568075505 18<ningu18>	ah ok, right, but I guess you'd generate the tsvector from all the unique words in the record
T 1568076572 18<velix18>	Sorry for abusing you as doc, but what was the function to count NULLIF over columns?
T 1568076603 18<velix18>	oh wait, let's do it the easy way: COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE a IS NULL) ;)
T 1568076688 18<velix18>	num_nulls()!
T 1568076767 18<peerce18>	count(1)-count(field)
T 1568076782 18<peerce18>	since count(field) is the number of not nulls...
T 1568076792 18<RhodiumToad18>	num_nulls is for multiple arguments, not an aggregate
T 1568076799 18<RhodiumToad18>	count(*)-count(field)
T 1568076805 18<peerce18>	yeah, thats why I suggested the other.
T 1568076827 18<RhodiumToad18>	or  count(nullif(field is null,false))
T 1568076833 18<velix18>	so num_nulls(col1, col2, col3) doesn't work?
T 1568076842 18<RhodiumToad18>	or  sum((field is null)::integer)
T 1568076857 18<RhodiumToad18>	velix: it does work, but I thought you wanted an aggregate?
T 1568076858 18<xocolatl18>	eww on that last one

T 1568114033 18<Myon18>	avoiding it and inventing new code instead of using whatever your app might already have for postgis sounds like a bad plan
T 1568114096 18<enoq18>	area in question will probably be germany, switzerland and austria (maybe italy)

T 1568114225 18<Berge18>	We're using the geography type wherever we can, and its performance is adequate for what we do
T 1568114268 18<enoq18>	the meh thing is that JPA spatial only seems to support geometry https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#spatial-configuration-dialect
T 1568114352 18<Myon18>	geometry has much more operators

T 1568114393 18<enoq18>	would be interesting if using geography on schema level works just fine with the geometry stuff
T 1568114414 18<Myon18>	possibly, but not all functions/operators will work
T 1568114491 18<enoq18>	another possiblity of course would be to order in application code
T 1568114763 18<enoq18>	is there a difference in precision regarding "point <@> point" and ST_Distance for Geometries
T 1568114772 18<enoq18>	since postgis and docker seems like a major pain
T 1568114888 18<Myon18>	using the same coordinate system, it should be the same

T 1568115146 18<ilmari18>	mazula: you need to specify both the column name and the type name (which should probably not be the same) in the CREATE TABLE statement
T 1568115195 18<ilmari18>	mazula: also, only use enums if you know that a) you'll never want to remove a value (you can only add and rename) b) you'll never want to attach any metadata to the values

T 1568115409 18<Myon18>	PostgreSQL is extensible, so it doesn't have to be in core
T 1568115437 18<Myon18>	and postgis has different release cycles and a huge stack of geo libs as dependencies
T 1568115451 18<Myon18>	it really wouldn't fit into one tarball
T 1568115458 18<enoq18>	ah so the geo libs are the main issue
T 1568115486 18<Myon18>	plus the people working on it don't have to be database experts (and the PostgreSQL developers don't have to be geo experts)
T 1568115541 18<enoq18>	mysql actually ships geography now
T 1568115550 18<ilmari18>	mazula: no. use the type name you used in the CREATE TYPE statement in the CREATE TABLE statement

T 1568158793 18<RhodiumToad18>	agohoth: the max wal size really only affects how frequent checkpoints are when you're writing large volumes of data

T 1568204373 18<ilmari18>	«The REASSIGN OWNED command does not affect any privileges granted to the old_roles on objects that are not owned by them. Likewise, it does not affect default privileges created with ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES. Use DROP OWNED to revoke such privileges.»

T 1568204730 18<ilmari18>	"reassign owned" will reassign ownership that can be reassigned. the subsequent drop owned will drop things that are associated with the role but aren't really ownership per se (granted and default privileges)

T 1568205083 18<[patrik]18>	bish: that doesnt make sense to me. the table (i think a db table) is not in any guaranteed order, and you build some wanted sort-order in memory.

T 1568205184 18<[patrik]18>	ok so the client software builds a list of "users" and their wanted sort order, and then what is supposed to happen?
T 1568205208 18<jtech18>	ilmari um.. so if I run again REASSIGN OWNED and DROP OWNED the recent objects should not be dropped as they were just reassigned, is that correct?
T 1568205209 18<[patrik]18>	the database is going to reorder stuff based on this client wishlist of order?

T 1568205535 18<[patrik]18>	ok i would do this probably with a temporary table or CTE of some sort. Make a plpgsql function to take that array of "users" (user_ids).
T 1568205593 18<[patrik]18>	so we have 5 users in the array (5,10,15,20,25) and we make the index in the array the sort order, so if you want different sort order, you have the client reorganize the array-order.
T 1568205680 18<[patrik]18>	so we say the index of the array is the sort order. Create a temporary table and select user_id from users where user_id in (.....); and insert that into the temproary table along with the array-index of each id.
T 1568205720 18<[patrik]18>	so you will have a table like this temp_table(user_id,sort_order) and have the function populate it based on the client wishlist.

The EnterpriseDB installer for Windows has broken somehow. Likely Microsoft's rather than EnterpriseDB, Inc.'s fault, but still, it gives that nonsensical error about not being able to finish the installation and you end up with a semi-broken installation (no matter what "tricks" you try to solve it -- they don't work) and have to figure
T 1568212683 18<dognosewhiskers18>	out how to initdb and start PG on your own. No "service" is installed, so I now need to have an ugly extra cmd.exe window running at all times (as if I didn't already have enough of those...) just to keep PG up.
T 1568212691 18<dognosewhiskers18>	So to clarify: I have my PG running now, but it's in a very... "flimsy" state. I don't feel comfortable doing it like this, and it took me a very long time and lots of effort to figure out. If somebody from EnterpriseDB is reading this, you should fire up a disgusting Windows 10 VM and try to figure this out ASAP.

T 1568277565 18<enoq18>	I suppose if you have an index over a text field it will throw an exception if it surpasses the index limit
T 1568277578 18<Myon18>	yes
T 1568277579 18<peerce18>	a varchar(255) would error if you tried to store a longer string in it, is that what you want?

T 1568277629 18<peerce18>	any sort of error exception requires the whole transaction be rolled back
T 1568277655 18<pstef18>	my workaround has been index on left(field, limit)
T 1568277688 18<Myon18>	pstef: but I guess the planner then needs that in the query as well?
T 1568277698 18<Myon18>	hash indexes would work I guess
T 1568277739 18<pstef18>	yes, sorry for being vague. you'd need left(field, limit) in the query too, and then the desired "x = field" predicate
T 1568277749 18<enoq18>	is varchar implemented on bytes? so a full unicode string would take 4 times it's size?
T 1568277768 18<Myon18>	enoq: varchar(n) is n characters
T 1568277827 18<pstef18>	hash indexes seems a good idea now; I didn't have those the last time I had this problem :)
T 1568277848 18<Myon18>	same here
T 1568277893 18<enoq18>	ah I see
T 1568277900 18<enoq18>	but that of course affects indices
T 1568277940 18<enoq18>	so varchar 512 would fit into the 2kb maximum for an index (worst case)

T 1568281601 18<Renter18>	kevinsjoberg: so that's a puzzle where you're given the schema and the problem and need to produce the result?
T 1568281610 18<Renter18>	Or do you need to alter the schema as well?
T 1568281680 18<kevinsjoberg18>	Renter: The schema I've written myself to demonstrate the problem I'm having. The schema is a simplified version of my application's schema.
T 1568281720 18<kevinsjoberg18>	The problem could be explained as "Given n amount of people belonging to the same fact, the same people need to be part of the same family to be considered valid".

T 1568281771 18<Renter18>	Is there a reason why you only have the maps?
T 1568281787 18<Renter18>	To me relational databases start off by having single lines for single entities in tables
T 1568281799 18<Renter18>	So for instances, to me this has three types of entities: facts, persons and families
T 1568281853 18<Renter18>	The need becomes more obvious if you add some more metadata to facts
T 1568281856 18<kevinsjoberg18>	Renter: There is a reason to it. This data does not map directly to tables in my database but are constructed from multiple data sources.
T 1568281875 18<kevinsjoberg18>	Renter: Some of the data, I don't even control.
T 1568281892 18<Renter18>	yeah, so your _maps tables are nxm relations that bind different tables together right?
T 1568281974 18<Renter18>	the problem becomes obvious when you simply want a list of unique facts, you have to write something like 'select distinct fact_id from fact_maps order by fact_id'
T 1568282013 18<Myon18>	kevinsjoberg: select fact_id, family_id, count(*) from fact_maps fc join family_maps fm on fc.person_id = fm.person_id group by 1, 2 having count(*) > 1;

T 1568282800 18<gajus18>	given that LATERAL JOINs and DISTINCT ON can often solve the same problem, is there a clear reason to always prefer one over the other?
T 1568282864 18<gajus18>	My rough way of picking one or the other depends on how large the dataset set it
T 1568282880 18<gajus18>	distinct on generally will have faster query execution plan but will be more memory greedy

T 1568283483 18<Janni18>	I DO get parameters in my logs for queries that are slower than the log_min_duration threshold. That allows me to reproduce and debug.
T 1568283512 18<Janni18>	However when a query times out or there is some other ERROR, I do not get any parameters in the logs, which makes things much harder.

T 1568288313 18<ne2k18>	I'm writing a trigger to modify a value on insert based on a modifier stored in another table. it feels as though it would be efficient to do this as a per statement trigger, but this appears to only be allowed AFTER insert; should I suck it up and do it per row, or is there a way to do what I want per statement?
T 1568288509 18<Myon18>	you'll need a transition table for that, and PG11+ (or was it 10?)
T 1568288531 18<Myon18>	otherwise, statement level triggers don't see individual rows
T 1568288556 18<ne2k18>	Myon, I have 11, but the docs say that they can only be used on AFTER. and I presume it would be bad form to allow it to insert the (unmodified) data, and the do an update to modify it?
T 1568288576 18<ne2k18>	if that would even work anyway -- it would end up being an upsert, which has to be written with a per-row thing anyway

T 1568290781 18<Mikjaer18>	I am going to create a table which needs to hold historical data for each row, what is the best way to do this? An exampe, date, name and phonenumber and we want to be able to know what phonenumber a given person had at a given time. The best / most efficient way to do this?
T 1568290974 18<ne2k18>	Mikjaer, you basically just need to add a timestamp column and add it to the primary key; then you can select distinct on that order by ts desc to get the most recent one, or select where ts between a and b, or whatever.
T 1568291002 18<Mikjaer18>	ne2k: that was our idea as well, but we're afraid that the performance is going to be horible?
T 1568291033 18<ne2k18>	Mikjaer, you can either do that and handle it in the queries, or have two tables, one with the current data and one with historic data, which you append to with a trigger when you update the main one
T 1568291153 18<ne2k18>	Mikjaer, I would do it with a single table, and make a view for the "current one"; then you can access the current data as if it's a table, and you don't have to write any different queries, and then later, if you decide to optimize it by moving it to two tables and a trigger, you don't need to change your queries
T 1568291197 18<ne2k18>	Mikjaer, how much data and how many reads/writes per time are we talking about, here anyway?
T 1568291261 18<Mikjaer18>	around 100 millions rows, and it's only being used for report generating
T 1568291340 18<Mikjaer18>	We store the entire dataset on a different server, and record changes, because we need to be able to show the entire history of the data, for legal purposes.
T 1568291454 18<ne2k18>	Mikjaer, so you're likely to access the "current" one far, far more often than any of the old ones?
T 1568291482 18<Mikjaer18>	yes
T 1568291509 18<ne2k18>	and is the historic data never required to be accessible on the "live" server, only through some other access method?
T 1568291530 18<Mikjaer18>	but the system is to be used by accountants that might want to know things like "How many values have been altered by more then x during period z" and not have to wait several minutes to get data back
T 1568291568 18<Mikjaer18>	The historic data is only used by accountants, lawyers and stuff like that if we need to proove something in a court or towards a goverment agency
T 1568291635 18<ne2k18>	select * from phone_archive where ts between za and zb group by userid having count(*) > x;
T 1568291648 18<ne2k18>	I can't imagine that is going to take minutes on 100 million rows
T 1568291685 18<Mikjaer18>	That was my opinon as well
T 1568291709 18<ne2k18>	Mikjaer, but given the size, and the fact that current is used a lot, would make me optimize it from the start
T 1568291758 18<ne2k18>	i.e. store current in one table, and then update archive (possibly on a foreign table) with a trigger
T 1568291860 18<Mikjaer18>	Can
T 1568291869 18<Mikjaer18>	Can't i do that with something like cached-view?
T 1568292400 18<theseb18>	Why do subqueries need parens like this... "select <column list> from (<select statement>) <name>;
T 1568292489 18<Moonsilence18>	because the from list are individual table expressions... syntactically needed in the case of subqueries
T 1568292529 18<Moonsilence18>	think of each subquery as a tabular result, from which you select just like directly from real tables.

T 1568294947 18<ne2k18>	theseb, so you basically want table company(name, hex1, hex2, hex3) and to lateral join that to you query you pasted, substituting the hex values for the ones from the table?

T 1568295099 18<wds18>	Clustering has helped the performance as well, but I'm a bit skeptical that for 40mil rows, our queries take over 2 minutes on an unclustered table?

T 1568295163 18<ne2k18>	wds, wait, what? selecting the rows between two times takes TWO MINUTES with a seq scan on 40m rows? that seems crazy

T 1568295499 18<ne2k18>	wds, lateral join is like a foreach; it allows you to use values on the left of the join in where conditions on the right
T 1568295515 18<theseb18>	ne2k: was that for me?

T 1568295540 18<theseb18>	ne2k: i was wondering how to do a for loop in SQL...if lateral joins is the way then they are definitely important
T 1568295600 18<ne2k18>	theseb, you can always write a procedural function in plpgsql (or other), but lateral join allows you to do a lot of "foreach"-y things without needing to resort to it

T 1568296296 18<wds18>	\d+ gives storage: main for that column
T 1568296384 18<wds18>	also, source is a foreign key to another table, in case that would matter?

T 1568296462 18<ne2k18>	wds, as I said, this is kinda beyond me, but I'd be very interested in the answers you get back
T 1568296496 18<ne2k18>	wds, but when I do select source, ts, value from test2 where source=x and ts between a and b; it does it with an index scan and it's hella fast

T 1568632158 18<bikeshedder18>	Aw. That example was terrible. I just realized that the alphanumeric sort already does that. I should have added a '3' and '20' in the list. e.g.: ['1', '1.2.5', '1.3', '2.20', '3', '20.1']. If I sort that alphanumerical I'll get '20.1' before '3'.

T 1568644610 18<Myon18>	in your case, it won't prevent non-serializable transactions from violating this requirement

T 1568709833 18<Berge18>	Parsing and processing time in the client is much greater than the network transfer speed anyway, in our case.
T 1568709838 18<Berge18>	The gains are very, very modest in practice.
T 1568709851 18<ioguix18>	compression without adding the crypto thing would be ideal

T 1568710153 18<DarkUranium18>	Berge, I think LZ4 might also be a good choice (apart from zstd).
T 1568710209 18<Berge18>	DarkUranium: yeah, likely. zstd has done better than lz4 in my tests, but it'll of course depend on datasets and CPU (features)
T 1568710226 18<Berge18>	And of course what you want to optimise for.
T 1568710254 18<DarkUranium18>	Yeah. I'm thinking LZ4 for compression speed/CPU use, zstd for compression ratio.
T 1568710266 18<DarkUranium18>	(as a rule of thumb, ofc)
T 1568710278 18<Berge18>	Well, to achieve the same compression level as zstd, lz4 needed quite a bit more CPU time in my tests
T 1568710292 18<Berge18>	As always, a speed-compression tradeoff
T 1568710313 18<DarkUranium18>	To be fair, LZ4 is very much decompression-speed optimized, not compression-speed.
T 1568710328 18<DarkUranium18>	But I didn't mean at the same compression level anyways.
T 1568710344 18<Berge18>	The zstd training mode is also cool
T 1568710383 18<DarkUranium18>	I have been toying with the idea of compressing some of my larger columns using either zstd or LZ4, with a predetermined table.
T 1568710399 18<DarkUranium18>	(they're 30kB on average ... not huge, but when you got thousands, it adds up)
T 1568710407 18<Berge18>	You can pre-train a dictionary for zstd on data sets similar to what you're going to compress.
T 1568710413 18<DarkUranium18>	Exactly.
T 1568710429 18<Berge18>	Which helps very much for small datasets.
T 1568710464 18<chris6418>	Berge: does it only speed up the compression or does it also improve the compression ratio?
T 1568710479 18<Berge18>	chris64: Both, to the same degree
T 1568710483 18<Berge18>	ish
T 1568710485 18<chris6418>	cool
T 1568710494 18<DarkUranium18>	Berge, I'd argue it helps even more for what I'm considering, which is small data *items* (per-column compression)
T 1568710501 18<Berge18>	DarkUranium: yep
T 1568710552 18<DarkUranium18>	Anyhow, the reason I was erring towards LZ4 here was to reduce CPU use, and because it's simpler (more portable).
T 1568710609 18<nickb18>	Hi. We had a "weird" crash yesterday: https://dpaste.de/4oRH/raw that resulted in replica losing a WAL segment (or part of it). This is the second time this has happened in the last few months, when primary removes a WAL-segment that wasn't actually shipped. Unfortunately I don't have WAL from primary, but I do have WAL from replica. Pg 10.9
T 1568710668 18<DarkUranium18>	Berge, I don't have zstd or LZ4 handy here, but interestingly, zip compression only gives me a 1.07 ratio.

T 1568711145 18<nickb18>	Myon: we still have to investigate that segfault; Might be a bug, but it points to libc.so. How would RAM corruption lead to WAL file going missing? Also, what f3f3lix said (ECC)
T 1568711319 18<Myon18>	nickb: note that it tried to move the file to 0_wal/something, of course that fails
T 1568711365 18<f3f3lix18>	yes. we noted that. isn't that very odd
T 1568711369 18<Myon18>	it's suspicious that "pull" and postgres were corrupted at the same time

T 1568711417 18<Myon18>	so it'd be interesting to check if pull has a real bug, or if that's some corruption somewhere
T 1568711428 18<f3f3lix18>	highly suspicious, but we have no evidence of actual hardware failure

T 1568716749 18<mobidrop18>	maxter, you could use a trigger or a rule
T 1568716777 18<maxter18>	I am trying trigger but instead of is not allowed on tables
T 1568716798 18<chris6418>	maxter: Did you find https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/plpgsql-trigger.html (or newer)? There it says that "In the case of a before-trigger on DELETE, the returned value has no direct effect, but it has to be nonnull to allow the trigger action to proceed. Note that NEW is null in DELETE triggers, so returning that is usually not sensible. The usual idiom in DELETE triggers is to return OLD."
T 1568716848 18<chris6418>	I would interpret that as returning null ignores the delete.
T 1568716884 18<maxter18>	so your saying put a before delete with a return NULL will keep my row intact?
T 1568716907 18<ilmari18>	I would expect that to make the DELETE return an error, not silently not delete it

T 1568721589 18<Myon18>	the parse needs huge amounts of RAM if the list is really long
T 1568721619 18<svip18>	Suppose I have a large table, T, (say 1 million rows), and I have a list of 3000 IDs, that I want to return of.  But I wish to restrict it to 100 result (`LIMIT 100`), but I am including all 3000 IDs in the WHERE clause, to ensure they are sorted correctly, i.e. so it is the first 100 rows of those 3000 elements according to a specific sort.
T 1568721640 18<svip18>	Myon: So the limit is on the parser?
T 1568721656 18<RhodiumToad18>	use an array instead of IN
T 1568721678 18<RhodiumToad18>	WHERE id = ANY (?)   where the ? is an array parameter, as long as you're not using psycopg2
T 1568721745 18<svip18>	I am using Go's PostgreSQL driver.
T 1568721815 18<svip18>	And arrays are faster than IN?
T 1568722010 18<chris6418>	svip: I think he's proposing to use a prepared statement then, so that the array is only inserted as a placeholder and transferred separately not in text but in binary form
T 1568722040 18<svip18>	I was going to do it as a prepared statement in either case.
T 1568722043 18<chris6418>	this then more efficient than parsing 3000 values from the string. however the query execution probably won't benefit
T 1568722072 18<svip18>	Or does prepared statements not work properly with IN?
T 1568722089 18<chris6418>	RhodiumToad: does that make a difference then?
T 1568722117 18<chris6418>	because it's not parsed anyway then, no?
T 1568722168 18<RhodiumToad18>	the parsing speed is better with arrays even if you do  =ANY('{1,2,3,4,...}'::integer[])  with an interpolated literal, but of course you should use a real parameter
T 1568722194 18<svip18>	The IDs in this case are UUIDs.
T 1568722210 18<RhodiumToad18>	most drivers pass parameters in text mode, not binary, but the specialized array-value parser is still far more efficient than the SQL parser

T 1568722260 18<RhodiumToad18>	the IN (blah,blah,blah) stuff goes through the general bison grammar, which is no speed demon and does a lot of memory allocations for each token
T 1568722338 18<RhodiumToad18>	(the problem with psycopg2 is that it interpolates array parameters as ARRAY[blah,blah,blah] which means you're right back to the bison parser again)
