T 1561817276 20<threenuc>30	Hey, I have an API running GraphQL - this means that if you want to request 'getUser', 'getCalendar', etc. you call only /api/graphql, and you pick what you want to receive (getUser etc.) in POST body. The problem is that access.log only displays "/api/graphql" and there's no way of telling which information was queried

T 1561972367 18*	grummund removed package nginx-full and installed nginx-light (on debian) and it broke a few things:
T 1561972381 18<grummund18>	nginx: [emerg] unknown directive "geo"
T 1561972450 18<grummund18>	but installing libnginx-mod-http-geoip doesn't fix this by itself, should it?
T 1561972495 18<grummund18>	anyone can confirm that difference between nginx-full/-light is simply module dependencies?
T 1561972603 18<benbrown18>	geoip != geo
T 1561972611 18<benbrown18>	They're different modules
T 1561972645 18<benbrown18>	Not a debian developer but I'm pretty sure the only difference between full and light are the modules that are included. If I were you I'd go back to nginx-full
T 1561972684 18<grummund18>	yeah i'll try that.  perhaps there's a binary difference too.
T 1561972749 18<benbrown18>	Run `nginx -V` before and after so you can compare
T 1561973217 18<MTecknology18>	When I first created nginx-{full,light,extras}, it was back in the day where modules were statically compiled.  Now that module support is a thing, it's only module dependencies.
T 1561973321 18<benbrown18>	Sounds like a pretty definitive answer there ;)
T 1561973409 18<grummund18>	MTecknology: so it should be possible to install nginx-light + only the desired modules?
T 1561973444 18<MTecknology18>	yup
T 1561973445 18<grummund18>	because 'geo' directive appears to be unknown in nginx-light
T 1561973467 18<MTecknology18>	is the module installed?
T 1561973486 18<grummund18>	which one? :p
T 1561973494 18<MTecknology18>	...
T 1561973787 18<grummund18>	going back to nginx-full it no longer barfs on 'geo', but complains about unknown directive "init_by_lua_file"
T 1561974128 18<benbrown18>	Try installing libnginx-mod-http-lua
T 1561974181 18<grummund18>	libnginx-mod-http-lua and liblua5.3-0 are installed.
T 1561974282 18<benbrown18>	You might be missing a `load_module' for it
T 1561974282 18<ngxbot18>	https://nginx.org/r/load_module
T 1561974328 18<grummund18>	interesting... because it *was* working, lemme see.
T 1561974644 18<benbrown18>	I had a working setup I would have just left it that way ;)
T 1561974696 18<benbrown18>	*if I had a working setup even...
T 1561974741 18<grummund18>	thanks for that ;)
T 1561974811 18<grummund18>	aha, found it.
T 1561974849 18<grummund18>	sudo ln -s /usr/share/nginx/modules-available/mod-http-lua.conf /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/mod-http-lua.conf
T 1561975908 18<grummund18>	ok. this may be the issue...
T 1561975922 18<grummund18>	nginx-light is compiled with --without-http_geo_module
T 1561975989 18<grummund18>	and there is no separate libnginx-mod-http-geo package
T 1561976011 18<grummund18>	(libnginx-mod-http-geoip is a red-herring)
T 1561976032 18<benbrown18>	That's what I said earlier...
T 1561976042 18<benbrown18>	Geoip is a different thing
T 1561976052 18<grummund18>	yes i get that ;)
T 1561976064 18<benbrown18>	All this isn't strictly nginx's fault though, it's how Debian etc have decided to package it
T 1561976075 18<grummund18>	sure.
T 1561976099 18<jaybe18>	!
T 1561976102 18<jaybe18>	!v
T 1561976102 18<ngxbot18>	`2>&1 nginx -V | xargs -n1 | sort`
T 1561976202 18<grummund18>	so the only way to have 'geo' directive using stock packages is with nginx-full.
T 1561976231 18<grummund18>	which is fine, btw. :)
T 1561976271 18<benbrown18>	Yes. apt-cache show nginx-light vs apt-cache show nginx-full shows it (I was curious and am running Debian. I use the packages from nginx.org myself though)
T 1561976373 18<grummund18>	benbrown: how does apt-cache show it?
