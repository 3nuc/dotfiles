If you need one, consider using Microsoft's media creation tool from a Windows computer (see ##windows for support).

T 1568722223 18<TJ-18>	MrMojit0: on Debian-derived distributions like Ubuntu there is a policy to provide [man]ual pages for every command. The tool to read them is called "man", so "man update-laternatives" will give you an overview and is usually more explanatory than doing, for example, "update-alternatives --help"
T 1568722243 18<TJ-18>	oops, typo, "man update-alternatives"
T 1568722598 18<MrMojit018>	I tried to understand but I do not get it. Shall I not first look into the firewall/network

T 1568722770 18<BluesKaj18>	rigel_, after setting your levels in alsamixer run, sudo alsactl store, that should hold the volume settings
T 1568722803 18<rigel_18>	but the [Speaker] bar should control the internal speakers, that's my real gripe here
T 1568722908 18<__monty__18>	Hi, I'm trying to install an i386 package (ghc) on a CI ubuntu box that seems to have a ton of held packages. Is there a better way to get this installed than iteratively adding whatever dependency apt-get complains about to the command and rerunning?
T 1568723010 18<sarnold18>	__monty__: dpkg --get-selections should let you find what's held, you can sed those to install or whatever, then feed that back into dpkg --set-selections, then an apt-get install -f will probably upgade everything. but you might want to talk to whoever held all those packages first.
T 1568723065 18<__monty__18>	sarnold: There's no "hold" in --get-selections output. Only install/deinstall.
T 1568723081 18<sarnold18>	__monty__: hmm. am I misremembering or are there no held packages? :D
T 1568723089 18<BluesKaj18>	rigel_, I don't have speaker vol ctl so I'm not sure how it interacts with other ctls, but make sure the automute ctl is disabled

T 1568723151 18<__monty__18>	sarnold: I'm not sure. I read the --get-selection advice elsewhere. All I know is apt-get install complains about held packages and --get-selection doesn't actually list any as "hold".
T 1568723229 18<sarnold18>	__monty__: apt also has some repo pinning, that *might* show the same thing, but I've never actually usd pinning, so I'm less sure of what it looks like
T 1568723801 18<__monty__18>	Well, manually adding packages to the command has gotten me further along. Though now it's failing because dpkg can't start the php 7.3 fpm?

T 1568735842 18<tomreyn18>	shreds: the first think you shouldprobably do, though, is to ensure you have the latest 'bios' installed, and to inspect your system logs, looking for (not only, but especially) acpi issues during boot.

I'm fairly new to that kind of kernel level debugging but I want to learn more about it so I can debug these kind of issues in the future. About the bios, that's what I suspect to be honest, I did a bios upgrade not long ago and I don't know if I'm just crazy but it seems to stem from that upgrade :-/

I also noticed my /swapfile partition does not have any UUID but for example in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume I have a UUID so maybe a partition misconfiguration?

T 1568742599 18<tomreyn18>	dmesg only returns the currently running kernels' logs, and only those which fitted its buffer. at some point during shutdown / suspend / hibernation file systems are unmounted, which effectively prevents logs from getting written to disk.
T 1568742636 18<tomreyn18>	so you may get to see more output on screen than end up on logs.
T 1568742654 18<shreds18>	oh that's what I thought, makes sense
T 1568743103 18<tomreyn18>	shreds: whats the context in which this NMI is triggered? is it while entering hibernation?
T 1568743211 18<MibixFox18>	Sven_vB mke2fs -L R -m 0 -t ext4 -b 4096 -N 1000000 -E lazy_itable_init=0 -v /dev/DEVICEADDRESS ended up working :D
T 1568743274 18<shreds18>	@tomreyn it was when booting up between 2 network/wifi related messages, seems unrelated but also another reason to debug for hardware issues like you suggested. I got hibernate to work a few times via echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk & echo disk > /sys/power/state but I'm still unsure what should be the proper command to execute. Does `sudo systemctl hibernate` make the same as manipulating /sys/power/disk & state? I
T 1568743274 18<shreds18>	guess so?
T 1568743300 18<shreds18>	I learnt so much about the kernel and systemd today, I hate to debug such things usually but I'm learning so much that I actually enjoy the ride hehe
T 1568743521 18<tomreyn18>	shreds: "systemctl hibernate" is the command you should run to hibernate on 18.04 LTS and newer. altewrnatively triggering hibernation using the GUI also works, it should run the same command. as the systemd documentation i pointed you to earlier states, you should not write to /sys/power/* directly, but let system handle it.
T 1568743899 18<shreds18>	tomreyn: ok thanks, I'm still going through all the docs I opened earlier, I'll get there eventually hehe I also read there's similar issues for NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD users which I have. Surely is related to hardware but why didn't this happen before? I'm also looking for any devices acting weird i.e. /proc/acpi/wakeup = https://termbin.com/utauu
T 1568744121 18<tomreyn18>	shreds: you mentioned something which sounded like "before" was "before bios upgrade". if you think that's the case, maybe try downgrading the bios and compare (using the identical OS configuration and kernel version).
T 1568744524 18<shreds18>	@tomreyn good point. so far it seems to work since I got rid of pm-utils/uswsusp. Now I even have better logging in dmesg. I have a hint pointing me hardware is messing with the hibernation: [ 2513.203392] ACPI: Hardware changed while hibernated, success doubtful! it still worked but it's the first time I see this message. Full logs here: https://termbin.com/ygys Getting closer and closer :D
T 1568744918 18<tomreyn18>	shreds: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_make_ACPI_work#ACPI_S4_hardware_signature_mismatch lists a workaround to ignore the hardware signature mismatch.
T 1568745029 18<tomreyn18>	shreds: in case you have a docking station, be sure to test hibernation first with the least complexity, which is without the dock, but with power cable plugged (ie. not running from battery).
