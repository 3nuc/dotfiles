T 1567756514 18<krigu18>	We're running our own bgp-routers and handing out IPs to customers (2-64 IPs, depending on project size, static configuration on customer site). We used to create subnets in seperate vlans for the bigger customers and put a couple of smaller ones in one subnet. one of the cons: customerA could bring up an ip from customerB. is it possible to separa
T 1567756515 18<krigu18>	te every customer from each other and keep the flexibility for growth? we could create a small subnet and vlan for every customer but that just doesn't scale well. let me know if you need more information, i wanted to keep it short
T 1567756782 18<detha18>	How are customers connected to this setup?
T 1567756886 18<krigu18>	detha: they're connected directly to our core-switches (untagged or tagged vlan port), static-ip configuration on customer-firewalls
T 1567756967 18<detha18>	you have no control over the customer-firewalls?
T 1567757019 18<krigu18>	it depends, but there are some where we don't have control
T 1567757212 18<detha18>	so with vlan-per-customer you have a hard limit at about 4000 customers. QinQ? Or just a bunch of ACLs, and automation.
T 1567757438 18<veek18>	okay so i got it to work by adding 'udp sport { 53 } accept'
T 1567757458 18<veek18>	on the OUTPUT chain - why the heck does it work?
T 1567757477 18<detha18>	krigu: or, depending what sort of switches you have towards custemers, something MPLS, but that sounds like killing a mosquito with a sledgehammer
T 1567757560 18<veek18>	nm figured it.. a local process will use output to o/p its pkts
T 1567758297 18<krigu18>	detha: the vlan limit of 4k is not a problem. we could create a vlan and /28 subnet per customer but it doesn't scale well if they need more IPs. So better create a bigger subnet/vlan and secure them with ACL? need to check if our brocade-switches can set port-security to only allow traffic from assigned IPs. Arp will be another problem
T 1567758423 18<pppingme18>	krigu just do static arp, then regardless of how bad a customer screws the pooch, the customer facing equipment won't be confused
T 1567758605 18<krigu18>	pppingme: good idea.. but customer could still bring up the default-gateway and confuse others arp-cache, right?

T 1567759472 18<detha18>	krigu: best you can do for address allocation is 'sparse allocation', when you allocat a new /28 leave the next 1 (or 3) /28s reserved, next customer gets the one after that. When you run into the top of your address space, start chipping away at the gaps for customers that are unlikely to grow

It's web interface is very outdated, so possibly firmware is old and needs update. I found interesting  exploit for the https://t.co/tSjOijrb8N, but target's rules forbid DoS.

T 1567851483 18<azonenberg18>	I actually didn't get in trouble for it, but only because I had previously coordinated with the client's IT department and they had explicitly approved the scan

T 1567851604 18<azonenberg18>	Yeah. Or maybe they'll test in house, or just do a "show ver", and give you credit for it without needing to exploit

T 1567852389 18<yuradoc18>	how it could be interpreted?
T 1567852444 18<azonenberg18>	I interpret that to mean that you are allowed to identify RCE bugs but not exploit them
T 1567852495 18<yuradoc18>	hm, but how i can test sql injection without testing
T 1567852503 18<yuradoc18>	for example
T 1567852518 18<azonenberg18>	That's a bit gray, i'd ask them to confirm - but most likely they mean you can't send any queries that would give you access you shouldn't have
T 1567852525 18<azonenberg18>	no selects of tables, no inserts, deletes, etc
T 1567852533 18<azonenberg18>	but a "select 1+1" would probably be ok
T 1567852557 18<azonenberg18>	even that could be interpreted as code injection though, so i'd ask before trying it
T 1567852569 18<yuradoc18>	ok...
T 1567852644 18<yuradoc18>	i read yesterday such separation: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/168327/difference-between-code-injection-command-injection-and-remote-code-execution

T 1567859388 18<xingu18>	DJHenjin: ok, so a working console port is pretty fundamental to this X4013+; the SoC literally has no ethernet until the bootrom is run, so if you need to break before the config file is processed, you need to have console connectivity

T 1567861102 18<grawity18>	no
T 1567861115 18<grawity18>	the amount of time it takes depends on the TTL setting that your old value had
T 1567861145 18<DJHenjin18>	you can set the TTL to a smaller value, if you want to guarantee propogation quicker, but in my experience DNS propagates fairly fast
T 1567861151 18<grawity18>	so if your TTL for that subdomain is currently e.g. "2 hours" then it'll take at most 2 hours for the old value to disappear from caches
T 1567861165 18<grawity18>	(people who never had it cached will just immediately see the new value anyway)
T 1567861186 18<grawity18>	and if you're going to play around, well, just set the TTL to like 5 minutes
T 1567861208 20<threenuc>30	I'm comparing two scenarios: buying a fresh domain vs editing an existing one. The propagation with a new domain takes 2 days, right? but when I have an existing one the changes update in [TTL amount] minutes?

T 1567861244 18<grawity18>	people who had the old data in cache (the negative "no such domain" response) will have it in cache for <TTL> seconds
T 1567861255 18<grawity18>	except the TTL is taken from the parent domain's SOA MINTTL
T 1567861266 18<grawity18>	and people who never had the old data cached will also see the new data instantly
T 1567861291 18<grawity18>	unless, if by "new domain" you literally mean buying a domain and updating NS delegations and all that
T 1567861300 18<grawity18>	that can take longer since it involves more systems than just DNS
T 1567861301 20<threenuc>30	huh, with namecheap (and checking with a dns propagation website) I had to wait ~24 hrs. Ok but thanks I'll try playing with the TTL value
T 1567861330 20<threenuc>30	I mean going to namecheap and registering a new base domain (eg example.com)
T 1567861353 18<grawity18>	the registrar which sold you the domain needs to submit it to the registry; the registry needs to update records at the TLD and push out the change to all of their *authoritative* nameservers (that's where the term 'propagation' *really* applies)
T 1567861371 18<grawity18>	that stuff can definitely take days, although it varies, some TLDs do it really fast
T 1567861389 18<grawity18>	(for me it usually takes up to an hour, worst case)
T 1567861420 20<threenuc>30	ok I understand now :) first time buying domains and I was in the dark. thanks a lot
T 1567861569 18<grawity18>	so when you're editing DNS records inside Namecheap, there can still be a delay while Namecheap pushes out changes to the domain's authoritative servers... but for most providers that's instant since it's just their own internal systems (only some, like Linode, still do it on a 10-min or 15-min schedule)

T 1568014825 18<azonenberg18>	i have a few ISRs that pull data from peripherals and shove them into ring buffers in RAM, then a main loop that checks for new events in the buffers and processes them (right now just keystrokes on the UART)
T 1568014841 18<azonenberg18>	no recursive functions, bounded run time on everything
T 1568014851 18<azonenberg18>	goal is to minimize the probability of a hang or crash
T 1568014878 18<azonenberg18>	That being said, since the packet datapath is entirely in FPGA and the CPU is just a user interface, it should be possible to have the CPU crash and have the system keep forwarding packets
T 1568014898 18<azonenberg18>	And have a watchdog timer and/or push button on the front of the unit that reloads the cpu *without causing any loss of network connectivity*
T 1568014925 18<azonenberg18>	This is an explicit design requirement, you should be able to desolder the CPU live and have the worst problem be loss of management
T 1568014937 18<detha18>	beware of initialisation routines - reboot control plane should not touch data plane, until it has read config etc.
T 1568014954 18<azonenberg18>	detha: the CPU will be essentially stateless
T 1568014964 18<azonenberg18>	any management commands will pull registers from FPGA then display them
T 1568014973 18<azonenberg18>	the FPGA will have its own flash to store port vlan config, etc
T 1568014995 18<azonenberg18>	so upon boot the FPGA will be doing its thing after a few hundred ms completely independent of the CPU
T 1568015012 18<azonenberg18>	there'll just be a register you poke to push the current register config to flash, a la "copy run start"
T 1568015018 18<detha18>	ok, so the fpga keeps running its config, and the cpu only updates it when told to. Nice
T 1568015021 18<azonenberg18>	Correct
T 1568015029 18<azonenberg18>	I'm explicitly trying to segment it that way for reliability
T 1568015048 18<azonenberg18>	the goal is to have as few possible points of failure that can lead to loss of connectivity for the LAN
T 1568015054 18<azonenberg18>	loss of management is a far less serious failure
T 1568015062 18<azonenberg18>	as i often go several days without logging into one of my switches
T 1568015069 18<azonenberg18>	i could have the CPU hang and not notice for a couple days :p
T 1568015077 18<azonenberg18>	although ideally the FPGA would notice and reboot the CPU. Lol
T 1568015083 18<snappy18>	azonenberg: so you need a bare metal tcp/ip stack before you can do ssh right?

T 1568015104 18<azonenberg18>	snappy: correct, i have yet to decide how much of that will be software on the MCU and how much will be using my existing FPGA tcp offload engine
T 1568015120 18<azonenberg18>	detha: yeah i should probably add SNMP at some point. Won't make initial firmware, "forwards packets" is about the one goal for that lol
T 1568015136 18<azonenberg18>	The FPGA is going to be the brains of the system, then the CPU will basically be a management coprocessor
T 1568015137 18<snappy18>	I'm guessing if the ESP8266 can do it, it shouldn't be difficult to do on MCU
T 1568015146 18<azonenberg18>	snappy: oh i've done bare metal TCP in the past
T 1568015158 18<snappy18>	but i don't know why you're using such a minimal MCU rather than a SoC
T 1568015164 18<detha18>	I think the ESP32 dev environment has a plain C ssh implementation. And that stuff runs on 'bare metal'

T 1568015286 18<azonenberg18>	Almost all cortex-A platforms need external RAM which adds to PCB cost and layout complexity, bigger footprints, more pins, etc

T 1568015349 18<azonenberg18>	The MCU is just management, and it's going to be all event driven
T 1568015364 18<azonenberg18>	the main loop will sleep until an interrupt happens, then wake up and process an incoming packet or something, then sleep again

T 1568015559 18<azonenberg18>	the CPU will be in full on sleep mode waiting until an interrupt happens
T 1568015573 18<azonenberg18>	once an interrupt happens the main loop will wake up, check the necessary flags, call the relevant handlers, then sleep
T 1568015587 18<azonenberg18>	unless another interrupt happened while that one was in progress, in which case it'll handle that event too
T 1568015614 18<azonenberg18>	Right now it's busy-polling just because i haven't added a "if no pending events sleep" call to the loop

T 1568015703 18<detha18>	that part of the code gets hairy; it fixes it self if you miss an interrupt, i.e. it will handle it the next time something else happens, but there be dragons

T 1568024298 18<dminuoso18>	PerryHugh: So connecthing things to a L2 hub is how you create a network. Things can all talk to each other, but this lacks one thing: the ability to connect multiple networks together with the ability to route between them.

T 1568024435 18<dminuoso18>	PerryHugh: So the way IP works, is by assigning fictive addresses to hosts. But since we defined ethernet to work with broadcasts and mac addresses, we need to somehow transform this IP behavior into ethernet frames. So the IP stack has to know that "sending a package to 1.2.3.4 means sending the frame to aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff", it does this by ARP. Once the IP stack has learned the mac address, it will send
T 1568024437 18<dminuoso18>	all "1.2.3.4" packages to aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
T 1568024522 18<dminuoso18>	The ether frame will further have its ether type set accordingly, so the other stack knows to interpret the content/payload of this as an IP packet. Once it arrives there, the IP stack will take this piece, and potentially route it further (which itself might cause ARP again, since it might have to send that package onto another device on some L2 domain)
T 1568024631 18<dminuoso18>	L2 Ethernet is about sending data between hosts on a network. IP is about connecting networks together (so strictly speaking, if you were just on a single local network, IP doesn't really give you many benefits on its own)

T 1568024782 18<dminuoso18>	ARP is merely the technology that lets you run IP ontop of Ethernet.

T 1568024852 18<PerryHugh18>	So MAC Addresses are used to narrow down frames from being broadcasts (which is itself a specific MAC address), to a specific device.

T 1568024991 18<PerryHugh18>	In this case, IP Addresses and MAC Addresses actually aren't necessary until a higher level application attempts to use or establish a connection, so the ethernet controller itself will connect and L2 won't necessarily have to even be invoked (though I'm sure it is as network discovery is common)?

T 1568035586 18<banisterfiend18>	hi guys, i'm curious about the relationship between TCP/UDP and ICMP
T 1568035614 18<banisterfiend18>	TCP/UDP packets clearly originate from a specific process (the one opening the sockets and sending data), but can the same be said for ICMP packets? do they also originate from a 'process' ?
T 1568035626 18<banisterfiend18>	or are they emitted from the networking stack itself?
T 1568035633 18<grawity18>	depends on packet type
T 1568035644 18<grawity18>	e.g. ICMP Echo is originated by the `ping` process
T 1568035655 18<grawity18>	but ICMP error packets come from the networking stack itself
T 1568035658 18<snappy18>	damnit, i was going to say no, but grawity has a clear counter example.
T 1568035673 18<grawity18>	especially since many of them come from a router mid-way, which clearly doesn't have an associated process for that packet
T 1568035677 18<banisterfiend18>	i ask because i have a cgroup in linux that redirects all packets from a specific process and i'm wondering if i should also expect the ICMP packets to be redirected
T 1568035793 18<banisterfiend18>	grawity interesting thanks. So if an ICMP packet originates from a process, then that process must build the ICMP packet itself using raw sockets right? but any ICMP packets that result in the course of a TCP/UDP connection from that process won't appear to come from that process?
T 1568035850 18<grawity18>	the former, yes
T 1568035859 18<grawity18>	the latter, I'm not sure how cgroups work in that regard
T 1568035884 18<grawity18>	though, what kind of ICMP packets could the network stack generate anyway?
T 1568035901 18<grawity18>	feels like most of them outright cannot be associated with a process...
T 1568035912 18<snappy18>	out of curiosity, how does the kernel know to send ICMP replies to the correct ping process?
T 1568035940 18<banisterfiend18>	grawity well, if there's errors in the TCP connection aren't those sometimes signalled by ICMP packets? and since the TCP connection is associated with a process, mightn't the ICMP errors packets also be associated with that process?
T 1568036003 18<grawity18>	snappy: I don't actually know offhand how `ping` implements it, maybe it uses raw sockets to capture all of them
T 1568036024 18<grawity18>	snappy: but Echo requests/responses do have an ID that is used to associate request with response
T 1568036027 18<snappy18>	ah that would actually make sense, you could just match on the ID
T 1568036084 18<detha18>	the network stack will generate things like fragmentation needed, if that applies to a packet from a connection one could say the icmp packet belongs to that connection
T 1568036108 18<grawity18>	but "fragmentation needed" would come from a router, not from the end host?
T 1568036126 18<grawity18>	whereas if fragmentation is needed locally, you'd get that from the syscall directly?
T 1568036151 18<detha18>	can come from anywhere. If I suddenly set the MTU down on my PC, with active connections, it'll do that
T 1568036254 18<snappy18>	I don't think it'd come from syscall directly, once you send/write, it'll hit the ip stack which will generate the icmp message accordingly which is generated locally
T 1568036278 18<banisterfiend18>	detha the thing is though, i'm tagging/marking all packtes that come from a certain PID (using cgroups) but those ICMP packets won't end up being marked right?
T 1568036294 18<banisterfiend18>	since even though they arose because of the process, they're not actually coming from the process, correct?
T 1568036313 18<detha18>	banisterfiend: good question. I don't know the linux network stack well enough to say Y/N
T 1568036407 18<detha18>	you'd have to try, run a process as a specific user, put rules in catching 'from user and icmp' and 'from user', and force the network stack to generate something
T 1568036417 18<detha18>	see which rules have counters going up
T 1568036546 18<snappy18>	probably a quick way to check is have the program connect() to a inexistent port on the same or remote machine that would generate a port unreachable icmp message
T 1568036581 18<snappy18>	i think if you can get that, you'll also get ongoing errors such as fragmentation needed
T 1568036809 18<snappy18>	i think the answer is in the affirmative, that is the icmp will get redirected to the appropriate process; the icmp error that's received will have sufficient information for the destination process (tcp/udp port) and then get sent to the process where the socket is currently operating
T 1568036821 18<snappy18>	but that's all just assumptions, anyway sleep time, good luck

T 1568193346 18<Habbie18>	praxis, depends on how one looks at it
T 1568193355 18<Habbie18>	[twisti], the dns-01 challenge method is perfect for this

T 1568193887 18<praxis18>	Habbie: i don't really get it. it seems excessive. it's to prevent dns walking, it seems? the domains the name server points to are stored as a hash instead of plain text?
T 1568193928 18<Habbie18>	praxis, you seem to be mixing up a few things
T 1568193953 18<Habbie18>	praxis, DNSSEC adds data authentication to the DNS; initially, it ALSO added zone walking to the DNS; this was 'fixed' by adding NSEC3 to DNSSEC

T 1568202102 18<grawity18>	yes, but the PPP details have nothing to do with the RJ11 connection itself!
T 1568202123 18<grawity18>	when talking about ADSL, the PPP is almost always "PPPoE", so yes, it's driven via RJ45/ethernet

T 1568283885 18<Phil-Work`18>	those are pre-terminated cables, you don't need to splice them
T 1568283918 18<Assid18>	i think i need 50m or so
T 1568283962 18<Phil-Work`18>	you'll struggle to get 10G that far on copper
T 1568283999 18<Phil-Work`18>	you'll want these: https://www.fs.com/uk/products/87603.html

T 1568284746 18<Assid18>	do all SFP+ switches work with the same cable ?
T 1568284808 18<Phil-Work18>	the cable is dependant on the transceiver you put in the SFP+ slot
T 1568284817 18<Phil-Work18>	not SFP+ itself
T 1568285102 18<Assid18>	ok so this https://www.fs.com/uk/products/50004.html should work with all HP switches  with SFP+  ?
T 1568285151 18<Phil-Work18>	select HP from the compatibility box and put your switch model number in
T 1568285157 18<azonenberg18>	Phil-Work: I prefer MM for in-building wiring not just because it's cheaper, but because the tolerances are looser
T 1568285164 18<azonenberg18>	9 vs 50um core means a lot less dust can cause problems
T 1568285176 18<azonenberg18>	and a lot less jiggle drops the link
T 1568285196 18<Phil-Work18>	azonenberg, sure though it tends to futureproof you less
T 1568285222 18<Phil-Work18>	the same SM fibre that you ran 1G on can now run 400G and probably 1T in the future, if you're lucky
T 1568285344 18<azonenberg18>	True, but the OM4 i'm using for 1/10G now is good out to 400Gbase-SR4.2 as well
T 1568285368 18<Phil-Work18>	sure
T 1568285375 18<azonenberg18>	i'm a loooong ways from needing that
T 1568285388 18<azonenberg18>	and when i do, it will likely be a handful of pipes
T 1568285402 18<azonenberg18>	and with the fiber in conduit and tray, replacing the OM4 with OM7 when the time comes won't be too hard or pricey
T 1568285420 18<azonenberg18>	If it's on the bottom of the ocean or something it's a whole different ball game
T 1568285441 18<azonenberg18>	but you wouldn't run MM for that anyway
T 1568285834 18<TJ-18>	Does anyone know of an RFC3597 DNS unknown RR generic generator where it is possible to give it the textual RR and it'll spit out the classXXX/typeXXX equivalent for known types?
T 1568285871 18<TJ-18>	there are several for CAA type257 but I was looking for one to easily handle type51 (NSEC3PARAM)
T 1568286450 18<Peng_18>	TJ-: If it's a live record, you can use dig +unknownformat

T 1568289056 18<djph18>	c0mrade: no, but 1.1.1.0/22 is part of 1.1.1.0/17
T 1568289138 18<Assid18>	c0mrade: the smaller network will be part of the bigger network
T 1568289431 18<TJ-18>	Peng_: the problem is creating the record in the first place... the reason = BIND9's dnssign-zone cannot handle an existing NSEC3PARAM RR in the zone file (known bug), so I was hoping to avoid the issue (as can be done with CAA/type257)
T 1568289474 18<Syzolin18>	TJ- are you trying to create a BlackList Server ?
T 1568289533 18<TJ-18>	Syzolin: no, just have an NSEC3PARAM record that doesn't break automatic re-signing with bind

T 1568289755 18<TJ-18>	Syzolin: I'd just like zone resigning not to fail due to finding the NSEC3PARAM RR
T 1568289775 18<Syzolin18>	oh that’s easy
T 1568290415 18<crockwork18>	TCPdump is still the best way to see stuff over the network, right?
T 1568290681 18<skyroveRR18>	crockwork: there's an improved version for those GUI fans, called wireshark.
T 1568290698 18<ne2k18>	crockwork, you may prefer tshark or wireshark, depending on your requirements, but they're basically the same
T 1568291493 18<praxis18>	hey is SFTP just ftp used in conjunction with ssh? or is it a whoe separate ervice
T 1568291599 18<galtj18>	i think it uses scp
T 1568291663 18<galtj18>	no
T 1568291664 18<galtj18>	ssh
T 1568291698 18<snappy18>	it doesnt use scp, it's separate from ssh, it's its own thing
T 1568291706 18<snappy18>	and it's not ftp.
T 1568291723 18<snappy18>	both regular ftp and ftps is an abomination that needs to die
T 1568291827 18<djph18>	praxis: it's a separate service.  It just happens to use a similar acronym.
T 1568292165 18<Sout18>	snappy, interestingly enough, the use of scp is disfavoured (by openssh) and sftp or rsync is recommended. https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html
T 1568292200 18<snappy18>	yeah i think after the recent scp exploit where a server can execute commands on the client (or maybe it was the opposite), i think scp has since been discouraged
T 1568292214 18<snappy18>	also sftp-server in openssh can be chrooted pretty easily.
T 1568293244 18<praxis18>	snappy: recent scp exploit?
T 1568293312 18<snappy18>	see: https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html

T 1568293434 18<snappy18>	yeah essentially that, basically the server can pick a file and write to it due to some wildcard hax
T 1568293446 18<praxis18>	would be super awkward to exploit, you have to get them to download from you
T 1568293452 18<snappy18>	no bueno if scp with wildcard as root
T 1568297212 18<rumbler3118>	hey all.  Trying to find some sanity.  My network security guy is adamant that we change the ips of a completely private network due to STIG https://www.stigviewer.com/stig/perimeter_router/2015-12-18/finding/V-14692
T 1568297236 18<rumbler3118>	the product had a few networks divided by routers, and obviously they are all on private ip ranges

T 1568297283 18<rumbler3118>	he thinks that because any router is a "perimeter device" that it must be given the "perimeter device STIG checklist" to complete, and wants to change the scheme to an address that is publicly routable

T 1568297299 18<rumbler3118>	thats what I SAID!!!!!!
T 1568297300 18<Habbie18>	rumbler31, in your case, the traffic you're allowing through is *not spoofed*
T 1568297306 18<rumbler3118>	YESSSSS
T 1568297316 18<Habbie18>	rumbler31, you seem super happy to hear that you're not mad ;)
T 1568297316 18<rumbler3118>	I'm trying to find any public guidance on this
T 1568297321 18<rumbler3118>	YESSSSSSSS!!!!!
T 1568297329 18<Habbie18>	'public guidance' is 'prevent all spoofing'
T 1568297338 18<Habbie18>	but this stig checklist item is 'never allow 1918 space through routers'
T 1568297344 18<Habbie18>	which is a fine checklist item for a lot of networks
T 1568297350 18<Habbie18>	as a more specific variant of 'just no spoofing'
T 1568297593 18<azonenberg18>	Habbie: there's a difference between an internet-facing border router
T 1568297600 18<azonenberg18>	and internal routers on a large network
T 1568297621 18<azonenberg18>	If your security guy can't understand that, you need a new security guy
T 1568297637 18<rumbler3118>	I tried to explain it.
T 1568297637 18<Habbie18>	rumbler31, ^ what azonenberg said was for you and obviously i agree
T 1568297664 18<rumbler3118>	next up in the issue train, is that the guy who is in charge of the routers to change, also thinks that the downstream networks need to change, even though NAT is implemeneted
T 1568297689 18<rumbler3118>	so the "wan" side would change, which I don't care about, but that other guy thinks that the individual lan sides need to change too
T 1568297752 18<rumbler3118>	my "I'm going to get fired response" was about to be "how do you think your home internet works...."
T 1568297840 18<rumbler3118>	but I am going to draft a very large letter outlining all this craziness
T 1568298632 18<tatertots18>	just curious...smells like a non profit environment/organization..am i right?

T 1568300279 18<TJ-18>	Anyone else noticed that bind9 DNSSEC NSEC3PARAM RRs contain the salt length but RFC5155 s4.3 says it should not?

T 1568300297 18<Habbie18>	TJ-, can you show that?
T 1568300350 18<Habbie18>	TJ-, or, to respond to 'anyone else noticed', it's the kind of thing i would have noticed ;)
T 1568300411 18<TJ-18>	Habbie: hmmm, it may be due to encoding... values surrounded with ( ... ) do they denote raw bytes inside ? dnssec-signzone generated: "example.com IN NSEC3PARAM ( 1 0 10 16 0123456789abcdef ) "
T 1568300433 18<Habbie18>	no, () just means newlines are ignored
T 1568300469 18<Habbie18>	so this is surprising
T 1568300472 18<Habbie18>	what version?
T 1568300494 18<Habbie18>	also, your salt is 8 octets long, not 16

T 1568300518 18<Habbie18>	but then the output would still be weird
T 1568300617 18<TJ-18>	right, but the length field is the number of textual characters not the RDATA field length
T 1568300632 18<TJ-18>	that's the same as an unknown RR record, e.g. if it were a type51 \# ... I think

T 1568619514 18<MaxFrames18>	hello
T 1568619647 18<MaxFrames18>	is it possible to make a connection between valn x on port x on switch x, and vlan y on port y on switch y, if both vlan x and vlan y are tagged on the respective ports? i.e. "move" packets from vlan x to vlan y? and what if either or both vlans are not tagged on the interface?
T 1568619795 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Sure.
T 1568619858 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Or rather, it depends on the switch.
T 1568619889 18<MaxFrames18>	so you can move packets between vlans, untag them if they are tagged, tag them if they are untagged, and change their tag (generally speaking, considerations on the specific switches aside)
T 1568620244 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: It depends on the switch. A good L2 switch can do out with basic stanzas, some of the shittier ones might require L3 features.
T 1568620308 18<MaxFrames18>	ok, I just wanted to know if in theory it can work like that. tbh I always had some problems understanding vlan tagging
T 1568620352 18<MaxFrames18>	as I see, it's really used to tell one vlan from another, but nothing theoretically prevents adding/removing/changing these tags while at the same time moving packets to a different vlan
T 1568620393 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: So the difference is thisÖ
T 1568620403 18<detha18>	That would make it one vlan, just with different tags on each port :p
T 1568620405 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Some switches like cisco with iOS implement a DSL
T 1568620425 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: That DSL has some semantics, forcing you to think of VLANs are these actual networks that somehow exist.
T 1568620426 18<earendil18>	MaxFrames: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q#Frame_format
T 1568620447 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Others like UBNT give you stanzas that explicit draw packets from a VLAN but tag it with a different vlan
T 1568620450 18<earendil18>	its not that you "move" the packets, as much as you just change that header
T 1568620458 18<MaxFrames18>	detha: yes
T 1568620530 18<detha18>	I am trying to find a use case for this
T 1568620531 18<MaxFrames18>	earendil: yes, by moving I mean that they reach the other switch
T 1568620592 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Look into VLAN mapping/translation in your switches manuals.
T 1568620600 18<dminuoso18>	(Thats what the feature is called)
T 1568620664 18<MaxFrames18>	also "vlan rewriting" possibly?
T 1568620670 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Possibly.
T 1568620740 18<MaxFrames18>	the use case would be pass traffic between two bridged interfaces in pfsense. one interface would be on vlan x and the other in vlan y
T 1568620743 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: Just make sure you consider which tranfer VLAN is used on your switches backplane.
T 1568620760 18<dminuoso18>	MaxFrames: (Since if you used say VLAN 10 as the transfer, and you connect other switchports to 10 you are bridging VLANs)
T 1568620766 18<earendil18>	huh interesting. i did not know double tagging was a thing
T 1568620786 18<dminuoso18>	earendil: Fun fact, you can do this an arbitrary number of times.
T 1568620809 18<dminuoso18>	earendil: You can do Q-in-Q-in-Q-in-Q...

T 1568711942 18<Phil-Work18>	arrity42, you could have them connect to every server but it scales badly
T 1568711973 18<Phil-Work18>	you'd be better to either use a hosted service or some sort of message bus (e.g. RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ) to route the message to the right subscriber server
T 1568711974 18<arrity4218>	really? it seems like it would be even more scaleable because it removes the need for something like redis
T 1568711998 18<arrity4218>	they're still distributing all the GET and POST calls to different servers
T 1568712016 18<arrity4218>	it's just that each server has a list of all the subscribers so that it doesn't need to hit redis first
T 1568712027 18<Phil-Work18>	it scales badly because if you end up with a million subscribers and 100 servers, you've got 100 million connections to manage (and a single server won't handle more than ~65,000 connections on a single IP, anyway)
T 1568712089 18<arrity4218>	hmm okay that's true
T 1568712124 18<arrity4218>	i'm not sure what rabbitmq is. i understand redis and how that would be used here but not sure if rabbitmq would be better, but i've heard about it
T 1568712140 18<arrity4218>	is it very similar to redis?
T 1568712145 18<Phil-Work18>	no
T 1568712161 18<Phil-Work18>	Rabbit is message bus - you publish messages to it and consume messages from it
T 1568712178 18<Phil-Work18>	in its simplest form, it's a FIFO queue... but there's a lot more to it in terms of message routing and distribution
T 1568712235 18<Phil-Work18>	it's a decent model as it avoids the need for service discovery - as long as everything knows where Rabbit is, everything doesn't need to know where everything else is... which makes scaling a lot eaiser
T 1568712337 18<arrity4218>	ok reading it about it now thanks
T 1568712421 18<arrity4218>	oh it's just a way to put a buffer between backend services
T 1568712483 18<Phil-Work18>	pretty much, though as I said there's some nice stuff in it for routing messages creatively between services
T 1568712493 18<arrity4218>	hmmmm.. is there no panacea? it's impossible to horizontally scale websockets/server-sent-events across multiple app independent servers without them first talking to a central authority?
T 1568712509 18<arrity4218>	unsolved problem?
T 1568712582 18<Phil-Work18>	well, it depends what you define as a "central authority"
T 1568712613 18<Phil-Work18>	something needs to manage it, but there's various database technologies (e.g. Cassandra) which are entirely distributed and cannot really be described as centralised

T 1568712685 18<djph18>	... err, right, scrollback :|
T 1568712742 18<arrity4218>	i just mean like.. let's say you're doing the most standard thing ever. a bunch of chat rooms, and you're using HTTP2 POST to send messages to a server. and server sent events (or websockets, w/e) to send messages back to everyone connected to a room
T 1568712768 18<arrity4218>	with a single server this is easy. you can just have a hashmap of room ID that maps to an array of connections
T 1568712784 18<arrity4218>	but to scale this across multiple servers, you need to introduce state, maybe in the form of redis
T 1568712795 18<arrity4218>	is there no way to avoid needing redis/state?

T 1568712854 18<Kim^J18>	There's no Redis or database invovled in that.
T 1568712865 18<arrity4218>	hmmmmmmmmmmm. what do you think of that solution?
T 1568712877 18<arrity4218>	also i don't know how irc works

T 1568712899 18<arrity4218>	well i could yes. is that how irc works though?
T 1568712917 18<E1ephant18>	yeah like a one pager on IRC would provide a lot of insight
T 1568712929 18<E1ephant18>	I would also second reading up there
T 1568712946 18<arrity4218>	what does that mean? "second reading up there"? you mean you agree with the suggestion to learn how irc works?
T 1568712949 18<Kim^J18>	arrity42: When you send a message to a channel, then you send that message to your server, that server then sends that message to all servers connected to that server, which in turn sends to additional servers and clients.
T 1568712960 18<E1ephant18>	yes, I agree with the suggestions to read about IRC
T 1568712962 18<Kim^J18>	So IRC messages gets spread across the network.
T 1568712972 18<arrity4218>	ok i will do that later it sounds interesting. but i'm interested in terms of performance/scalability
T 1568712975 18<E1ephant18>	it's very distributed by design
T 1568712990 18<Kim^J18>	arrity42: That is performance and scalability.
T 1568712992 18<arrity4218>	which would perform better generally? a redis server with pub/sub or this distributed design?
T 1568712996 18<E1ephant18>	yeah literally from 1985
T 1568713000 18<djph18>	arrity42: well, it's been working pretty well for 40 years
T 1568713003 18<E1ephant18>	and still largely the same
T 1568713017 18<Kim^J18>	arrity42: What do you expect the Redis server to add?
T 1568713024 18<E1ephant18>	networks have held 100,000s of users
T 1568713042 18<Kim^J18>	arrity42: Messages are bufferend on the server, so sent in bulk.
T 1568713053 18<Kim^J18>	Which allows you to scale pretty decently.
T 1568713058 18<arrity4218>	hmm interesting. i realllllly hate state so i am very interested in this idea and i would like to pursue it. i'm just worried that it might be inferior to a stateful pubsub mechanism like redis from a perf standpoint
T 1568713085 18<djph18>	IRC performs pretty damn well...
T 1568713111 18<E1ephant18>	yeah seems to be wokring here
T 1568713111 18<Kim^J18>	arrity42: The very same idea is implemented on LMAX to poer their trading platform.
T 1568713125 18<Kim^J18>	Which handles millions of messages per second.
T 1568713142 18<arrity4218>	oh that's good to hear. ok so question then
T 1568713155 18<Kim^J18>	Redis could only dream of that performance.
T 1568713243 18<arrity4218>	so let's go back to the simple chatting example. where each server uses SSE and has a hashmap of roomIDs to an array of connections. you're saying that the user POSTs a message to an arbitrary backend server and then that server relays that message to everyone via SSE by looking up the room id and sending to all connected clients, and then it also
T 1568713243 18<arrity4218>	does a POST request to all the other backend servers with the message and room ID and all those servers do the same thing? (look it up and send that message to everyone in that server's hashmap)?
T 1568713250 18<Kim^J18>	arrity42: Don't choose what others choose on the premise that they are successful.
T 1568713276 18<Kim^J18>	Yes
T 1568713286 18<arrity4218>	that honestly sounds amazing. i love the stateless design
T 1568713292 18<arrity4218>	if you all endorse it then i will pursue it

T 1568713505 18<djph18>	well, can't have server[2..X] sending back to server1
T 1568713514 18<djph18>	message would loop forever
T 1568713553 18<arrity4218>	oh ok i see. i don't think that would happen in my case
T 1568713612 18<arrity4218>	i guess the only remaining problem is how each server knows the address of all the other servers

T 1568713657 18<Kim^J18>	Then you simply add a node to any existing node and that node tells all the other nodes
T 1568713687 18<arrity4218>	i'm trying to avoid the need to have any other servers besides my app servers. like no central authority
T 1568713695 18<arrity4218>	the user can just connect to any random backend. no load balancer even

T 1568713768 18<arrity4218>	yeah that's what i meant by law of large numbers. each user when they connect to the app just rolls a random number between 1 and SERVER_COUNT and connects to that one

T 1568713967 18<TandyUK18>	no, your loadbalancers would each have an ip, eg 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5, then you setup a floating ip with carp/vrrp/etc such as 1.2.3.6, then that is the only ip your clients ever see

T 1568713972 18<arrity4218>	so a floating ip means you can have a single ip address that can refer to multiple servers? and if one goes down it goes to the other one?
