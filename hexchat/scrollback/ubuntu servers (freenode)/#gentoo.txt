T 1567251179 18<sven^18>	hi. There was a critical CVE for dovecot 2 days ago but the fixed version wasn't stable till yesterdayish, because it depends on masked packages (binutils-libs-2.31.1-r6, libmysqlclient-18). So now it seems the maintainer just made the ebuild stable without updating the dependencies. Is there anything I can do about this? Like where can I submit a patch? Or is there even a patch underway and I should just give it another day?
T 1567251334 18<BtbN18>	I updated to the fixed version right away and did not need to unmask anything else.

T 1567256601 18<sharp1518>	redsh: ok.  does that mean i can just comment out the "PATCHES=" line and re-do the manifest?
T 1567256681 18<redsh18>	I don't know. I assume the patch is there for a reason. And where did it come from, a commit to the codebase between version 1.x and 1.y that got added to version 1.x in the Gentoo package and obviously won't apply when 1.y is out?
T 1567256714 18<redsh18>	Maybe it fixes some build problems. But sure, just ripping it out could work.
T 1567256780 18<sharp1518>	redsh: i'm sorry.  i understand your "doesn't apply" now. read as "wont complete - wrong file"
T 1567256848 18<redsh18>	That means the patch file doesn't work because the files it's meant to patch have been changed in the meantime, thus invalidating the patch, or maybe they're missing entirely or something.
T 1567256873 18<sharp1518>	redsh: ok.  ty for clarifying.

T 1567259703 18<tdr18>	t4nk-freenode, sometimes there may be a new version of a library available but the programs you have need a version you already have, so it will choose not to update 'everything' ... its fine.

T 1567416294 18<redsh18>	If it's the ESP, then I believe it has to be FAT32, unless your firmware just so happens to have support for ext filesystems and is willing to read it.

T 1567416611 18<redsh18>	I don't think the partition type should matter either.

T 1567416742 18<lioh18>	okay, it says later: "When using ext2, ext3, or ext4 on a small partition (less than 8GB), then the file system must be created with the proper options to reserve enough inodes." In the example the /boot partition is just 128M, so should I mkfs.ext2 -T small /dev/sda2 instead if just mkfs.ext2?

T 1567425813 18<Jens18>	I've read https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Version_specifier and I'm still unsure. If I want to keep dev-lang/ruby at 5.1.*, what do I put in package.mask?
T 1567425825 18<Jens18>	Portage says ">dev-lang/lua-5.1*" is invalid.
T 1567425887 18<lioh18>	leio, so it could look something like that? http://termbin.com/x2ta
T 1567425923 18<sheep18>	Jens: ~dev-lang/lua-5.1*
T 1567425937 18<leio18>	lioh: no, you seem to be modifying the existing profile, which will get overwritten on next sync. That or you don't realize the entries in there are relative or absolute paths.

T 1567426036 18<lioh18>	leio so i have to set it with absolute paths?
T 1567426040 18<sheep18>	Jens: you do know that lua versions greater than 5.1 are already masked, right?
T 1567426047 18<Jens18>	Hmm --> "Invalid atom in /etc/portage/package.mask: ~dev-lang/lua-5.1*"
T 1567426073 18<Jens18>	sheep: Yea, but I'm just guarding against the posibility that they some day may not be.
T 1567426078 18<leio18>	lioh: or relative, but relative to /etc/portage/make.profile/ (which you were supposed to make your own dir, not a symlink that eselect profile manages).
T 1567426097 18<sheep18>	Jens: are you certain that things will break with lua 5.2 or 5.3?
T 1567426160 18<sheep18>	Jens: sorry, I misread the wiki. =dev-lang/lua-5.1*
T 1567426171 18<Jens18>	I haven't tried. But this is some old terrible unmaintained software that claims to require 5.1, and I'm not in the mood for taking chances with it. It's a miracle it even compiles still.
T 1567426195 18<lioh18>	like this: http://termbin.com/7tzm leio
T 1567426207 18<lioh18>	ah, now i understand. i missed the symlink part
T 1567426209 18<leio18>	Jens: you wouldn't be p.masking 5.1 to keep 5.1.
T 1567426240 18<leio18>	Jens: you'd be maybe p.masking newer instead, but they already are, you'd just enforce it for longer, and then get into trouble whenever 5.1 gets removed.
T 1567426262 18<Jens18>	Hmm.
T 1567426287 18<leio18>	Jens: but I'm not sure when that will happen - nothing newer is available yet still, and no-one is working on it. The plan is to have 5.1, 5.2 and so on all co-installable, but it's a lot of work; and it's a lot of work to have only one too, but newer one, due to similar problems as you are fearing about (stuff not working with newer).
T 1567426320 18<leio18>	[14:49:53] <+leio> you can make a manual mix-in profile
T 1567426320 18<leio18>	[14:50:00] <+leio> remove the /etc/portage/make.profile
T 1567426320 18<leio18>	[14:50:06] <+leio> create it as a directory instead, with an eapi and parent file in them
T 1567426321 18<leio18>	lioh: ^^
T 1567426347 18<leio18>	the eapi file should contain the line "5" without quotes.
T 1567426355 18<Jens18>	Hmm. I'll just forget about this masking business, and let future Jens deal with it, if it becomes an issue.
T 1567426366 18<lioh18>	leio, yes, this is what i have done now
T 1567426386 18<leio18>	may want to undamage the symlinked profiles parent file too, with a rsync perhaps.
T 1567426694 18<lioh18>	okay, i have to think about all that and maybe swith/reinstall to a multilib setup anyhow tomorrow

T 1567427633 18<amitprakash18>	I did refer that.. by this documentation, it should allow me to override compiler definitions, correct?
T 1567427657 18<amitprakash18>	specifically, I am trying to replace-flags "-DVK_USE_PLATFORM_XCB_KHR" "-DVK_USE_PLATFORM_WAYLAND_KHR"

T 1567435288 18<noodlepie18>	Hiya guys - I'm having a mare getting nvidia-drivers to work - I have "intel i965 nouveau nvidia" in make.conf as VIDEO_CARDS and ACCEPT_LICENSE="*" but am getting a GPL-incompatible error message - I will post the log in a second
T 1567435316 18<BtbN18>	You're gonna have to pick either nvidia or nouveau. They are mutually exclusive.
T 1567435324 18<noodlepie18>	ok, I'll go with neauveua
T 1567435353 18<BtbN18>	Be aware that nouveau performs horribly, and you might as well just ignore the nvidia card then, and use intel exclusively.
T 1567435359 18<noodlepie18>	thanks BtbN
T 1567435386 18<BtbN18>	Also, an Optimus setup is not straight forward and involves a lot of fidling around with X configs and xrandr.
T 1567435419 18<doc23518>	there is a section for that
T 1567435436 18<noodlepie18>	in the handbook, doc235 ?
T 1567435437 18<BtbN18>	The section is in need of a rework with Nvidias latest driver now.
T 1567435452 18<BtbN18>	Since they introduces proper runtime switching. I don't think that's covered yet?
T 1567435463 18<noodlepie18>	rightoh
T 1567435842 18<DarthM18>	hello, i just tried to create an ebuild for jupyterhub, which is python and pretty straight forward, but in the build process it is calling npm to download some stuff which is not working because of the missing network connectivity during the emerge process. Is there something i can do, to make it happen anyway?
T 1567435999 18<DrEeevil18>	DarthM: iirc the nodejs bits are optional
T 1567436015 18<mattmatteh18>	DarthM: as a wild guess, you might tryto emerge -1a net-libs/nodejs
T 1567436038 18<DarthM18>	nodejs is already installed, because it's a dependency
T 1567436039 18<DrEeevil18>	mattmatteh: that doesn't help with node modules (fetched with npm)
T 1567436047 18<DarthM18>	this is the message "npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/bootstrap failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org:443"
T 1567436052 18<mattmatteh18>	DrEeevil: oh, thanks
T 1567436053 18<DrEeevil18>	npm is pretty much the most careless way to throw stuff onto a system
T 1567436055 18<DarthM18>	npm is also installed
T 1567436116 18<DarthM18>	i had it before that the emerge process/(sandbox?) is not allowed during the compile/build process to communicate with the outside?
T 1567436163 18<DarthM18>	only SRC_URI/GIT.... is the only way to download sources?
T 1567436173 18<DarthM18>	so npm has no connectivity to download something
T 1567436196 18<DrEeevil18>	network sandbox, and that's a very good idea
T 1567436213 18<DarthM18>	and npm is used in the python setup.py for jupyterhub
T 1567436302 18<twnqx18>	hm. using -j32 causes so heavy IO that other things slow to a crawl
T 1567436313 18<twnqx18>	maybe i should switch back to a ramdisk...
T 1567436374 18<DrEeevil18>	twnqx: so you can swap more? ;)

T 1567499348 18<JCaesar18>	macroprep: Given that I've had many friends complain about "meeh, absolutely no binary packages for gentoo"… yes. (although I think there are some for chromium and libreoffice, because you simply can't compile them on small machines.)
T 1567499362 18<JCaesar18>	Of course. The kernel config is everyone's favourite plaything, no?
T 1567499363 18<MalakymR18>	yes kernel, although stage4 now has kernel
T 1567499377 18<redsh18>	Not for Chromium, but there's Google Chrome.

T 1567499421 18<macroprep18>	so this would be easier to port to a different architecture than archlinux cus arch provides prebuilt binaries right
T 1567499446 18<redsh18>	Sure, I guess. It already supports a relatively wide range of architectures as well.

T 1567499518 18<twnqx18>	android as it's core instead of a pure linux... not so much
T 1567499520 18<rjp42118>	prebuilt is sometimes unnecessarily bloated with stuff you dont need or want using up space and ram

T 1567499568 18<redsh18>	Since the latter comes with its own weird libc that you'l need to have a lot of patches for to work around its quirks and missing features and so on.
T 1567499626 18<redsh18>	... Maybe not if you just roll with glibc in a prefix or something, I guess? But it'll probably be a bigger headache than just regular Linux on aarch64.

T 1567516313 18<cosimone18>	i have a suggestion to make: when using the gtk frontend with libreoffice, dbus is used to provide the menubar
T 1567516323 18<cosimone18>	in order for this to function correctly, dbus must have X support enabled
T 1567516348 18<cosimone18>	however, libreoffice with the gtk USE flag does not depend on dbus having the X USE flag enabled, resulting in a missing menubar with gtk enabled
T 1567516351 18<grawity18>	eh? regular dbus functionality doesn't involve X

T 1567516504 18<grawity18>	literally the only thing dbus-daemon uses X for is auto-launch when the session daemon is missing, so

T 1567516596 18<cosimone18>	grawity, exactly, that's why the problem arises when you don't have a dbus service
T 1567516621 18<grawity18>	then launch a dbus service, you don't need autolaunch for that
T 1567516634 18<cosimone18>	in my opinion, you shouldn't need to
T 1567516654 18<grawity18>	in dbus maintainer's option, as far as I remember, autolaunch is a last-resort feature to make dbus-requiring apps work in a broken session
T 1567516669 18<HuggyBear18>	or virtual/opencl also i guess
T 1567516711 18<grawity18>	(among other things, it's not going to work on pure wayland systems due to being somewhat X11-specific)

T 1567532453 18<iamben18>	safest way in general is a package.use entry, but i happen to know that this flag only affects one single package, so you could set it on command-line to be undone later

T 1567532489 18<tlhonmey18>	ccokee: It only needs it temporarily to get out of the dependency loop, so you could try just tacking USE="internal-glib" right before "emerge" and see if the results are reasonable and then just emerge --changed-use afterward to finish it up.
T 1567532513 18<iamben18>	you wouldn't wanna set it on command-line if it were a more commonly-used flag

T 1567540606 18<Paradox55555518>	You can encrypt folders without using full disk encryption
T 1567540640 18<tlhonmey18>	Paradox555555: nah.  Most of the time I'm looking to make sure that if somebody scampers off with a laptop there's no way for them to extract anything from it.
T 1567540663 18<Paradox55555518>	wouldnt running luks on a partition and then mounting it on a folder achieve the same thing?
T 1567540693 18<tlhonmey18>	No, because then you still have to worry about data leaking into OS logfiles or the swap partition.

T 1567540744 18<tlhonmey18>	Paradox555555: It's only always powered if you don't turn it off...  Also, there's a kernel module for that...
T 1567540767 18<Paradox55555518>	doesnt the kernel module significantly degrade performance though
T 1567540785 18<Paradox55555518>	and yeah, im more worried about someone taking the laptop while its powered on in a public setting
T 1567540799 18<Paradox55555518>	and most people just close the lid so it hibernates anyway
T 1567540817 18<tlhonmey18>	No, it's just a killswitch.  If you turn it on without the proper USB device plugged in, or unplug that device while it's running then it wipes the keys off the disk and zeroes the memory until the system dies.
T 1567540863 18<Paradox55555518>	oh
T 1567540881 18<tlhonmey18>	I've seen a couple of different implementations.  Never needed to use one, but it's an option if you need something really secure.
T 1567540917 18<Paradox55555518>	doesnt luks automatically wipe the keys from the disk when shutdown is initiated anyway?
T 1567540929 18<tlhonmey18>	no.
T 1567540951 18<tlhonmey18>	There are two levels.  There's the user password that's used to decrypt the keys, which never gets put on the disk in the first place.
T 1567540976 18<tlhonmey18>	And then the keys themselves which are encrypted with the password and stored in the header because they're large enough that typing them in would be problematic.
T 1567540991 18<tlhonmey18>	You can also put them on an external device that you carry with you if you prefer.
T 1567541007 18<Paradox55555518>	How heavily impacted is your security by keeping them in the header
T 1567541008 18<tlhonmey18>	But they're too big to really be typing in all the time.
T 1567541020 18<Paradox55555518>	especially if you're using a passphrase and key on the user level
T 1567541030 18<tlhonmey18>	It's as strong as your passphrase.
T 1567541039 18<Paradox55555518>	so, passphrase+key = pretty secure
T 1567541042 18<Paradox55555518>	why wipe it at all then
T 1567541062 18<tlhonmey18>	because if you wipe it then even the guy who knows the passphrase and has the keyfile can't unlock it anymore.
T 1567541069 18<Paradox55555518>	sure
T 1567541079 18<tlhonmey18>	So you can't be tortured into giving it up.  It's just gone and forever irretrievable.
T 1567541089 18<Paradox55555518>	but if you store it on the same usb as the user key then it eliminates the point
T 1567541094 18<Paradox55555518>	does it wipe the headers on a clean shutdown?
T 1567541120 18<redsh18>	It can't wipe the headers if you plan on accessing the encrypted storage.
T 1567541155 18<Paradox55555518>	oh right, killswitch
T 1567541158 18<Paradox55555518>	i need coffee

T 1567541169 18<Paradox55555518>	what happens if the usb actually falls out on accident lmao
T 1567541173 18<Paradox55555518>	that would be a big whoops
T 1567541186 18<tlhonmey18>	It's layered encryption.  There's a big key that's stored non-volatile somewhere that's what your massive amount of data is encrypted with.  Because the bigger the key the more data you can encrypt without compromising it.
T 1567541206 18<tlhonmey18>	That key is small enough to be encryptable with a smaller key and/or passphrase.  That's what the user provides to unlock it.
T 1567541242 18<tlhonmey18>	The big key generally never leaves the system except maybe to a secure backup location.
T 1567541275 18<tlhonmey18>	So if you wipe it, poof.  Data's irretrievable until such time as you can brute force a 4096 bit key.
T 1567541327 18<Paradox55555518>	so what if your user keyfile is also 4096
T 1567541331 18<Paradox55555518>	:V
T 1567541361 18<tlhonmey18>	Then that's a bit overkill, but we all know there's no such thing as overkill, there's only "open fire" and "I have to reload".
T 1567541412 18<tlhonmey18>	Regardless, anything that would provide a security benefit to wipe on shutdown the system generally doesn't write to disk in the first place unless it's configured really strangely.
T 1567541453 18<tlhonmey18>	Now, I believe it can be set to zero the RAM on shutdown to make sure there aren't any keys floating in there that might be retrievable for a few minutes.
T 1567541482 18<tlhonmey18>	Which is one of the steps the killswitch modules I've seen can be configured to take.
T 1567541518 18<tlhonmey18>	If you're looking for plausible deniability you might look at stegfs and pingfs...
T 1567541535 18<Paradox55555518>	No I'm not that paranoid
T 1567541553 18<Paradox55555518>	I just think with full disk encryption the goal should be plausible deniability
T 1567541615 18<tlhonmey18>	Plausible deniability at the full disk level requires some capabilities that LUKS doesn't really have.
T 1567541636 18<tlhonmey18>	Truecrypt/Veracrypt do it by having a reserved space that you can't tell if it has a second key in it or not.

T 1567541714 18<tlhonmey18>	Paradox555555: LUKS doesn't really have a way to do that.  Unless they've added it recently.  It's obvious that there's a LUKS header, but there's only one place a key could be.
T 1567541735 18<Paradox55555518>	Right but the header shows there is a key in slot 0 or whatever its called

T 1567541996 18<tlhonmey18>	Paradox555555: But it doesn't really have a way to let you use a subchunk of the encrypted partition for a different filesystem without totally wrecking the main filesystem.  Even if you hid the header anyone looking at it is going to say "random numbers on your disk looks like encryption.  Give me the key or else."  For PD you have to be able to hand them a key that only decrypts innocuous stuff.

T 1567542186 18<tlhonmey18>	Paradox555555: Anyone who sees a disk full of random noise is likely to assume that it's encrypted and demand access and not be satisfied until they get *something*.
T 1567542199 18<tlhonmey18>	Refusing to give them anything is probably not plausible in most cases.
T 1567542234 18<tlhonmey18>	Hence steganography, which is hiding your data such that they can't even be certain if there's anything there.

T 1567676044 18<lg18818>	I noticed it relies on boost 1.65.0 while i have 1.70.0 installed
T 1567676110 18<lg18818>	does anyone know if this is related or just coincidence
T 1567676452 18<infinmed18>	lg188: if it is related? does it explicitly rely on the former or does it rely on it or anything greater than it?
T 1567676498 18<infinmed18>	If it relieds on only it, then it would surely tell you.
T 1567676588 18<lg18818>	It doesn't lock out the depedency but the official build depends on it
T 1567676610 18<lg18818>	so I think the gentoo ebuild might be lacking the restriction
T 1567676645 18<infinmed18>	Well if that is the problem then it would fail during the check or compile of the gentoo version
T 1567676692 18<lg18818>	Blender does fail to compile when boost 1.70.0 is installed

T 1567676795 18<infinmed18>	well if the configure check did not fail but yet the official version checks for it then i would not neccesarily think that is the cause. The gentoo version could be different or patched

T 1568013822 18<Kangie18>	honigkuchen, what redsh said - If you can explain what you're doing and why you're trying to do it, we might be able to put you onto a better solution.
T 1568013853 18<redsh18>	Based on what he said on -chat, it's blender, which needs a bit more updating and some dependencies need to be updated as well.
T 1568013868 18<redsh18>	Err, the ebuild needs updating, rather.
T 1568013898 18<Kangie18>	yeah, I figured it would be that.
T 1568013913 18<honigkuchen18>	I learned how blender solved such things by just putting depencies in home
T 1568013928 18<redsh18>	Good luck updating to 2.81 like that :D
T 1568013928 18<honigkuchen18>	and asked myself and you how such thing can be dealt in general
T 1568013936 18<Kangie18>	Tbh it sounds like a whole bunch of the changes for blender 2.8 are to do with the python_target being 3.7
T 1568013976 18<redsh18>	There was that link to a repo with some ebuilds. Taking a look at the ebuilds for anything sketchy and then adding them to your local overlay probably would've worked.
T 1568014049 18<redsh18>	I've personally written some ebuilds. Not very complex ones, thankfully, since the build systems were sane.
T 1568014083 18<Kangie18>	Yeah, most of the time if you update an ebuild's version number and stick it in your local overlay it'll grab the appropriate version sources and go ahead and compile them.
T 1568014134 18<redsh18>	I mean actual new ones, not just version bumps :P
T 1568014160 18<redsh18>	Projects do occasionally make bigger changes like new/removed dependencies or even change their build systems.
T 1568014168 18<Kangie18>	oh yeah.
T 1568014185 18<Kangie18>	I've got an ebuild in bugzilla now. I should really update that with the improved version I made.
T 1568014801 18<Paradox5518>	iamben if/when you get on and if you see this, after reinstalling three times and messing with this all day the "solution" was to downgrade f2fs-tools to 1.10.0
T 1568014811 18<Paradox5518>	little package mask, done

T 1568022621 18<ManDay18>	Hm, why would `emerge -uDN world` try to reemerge XYZ from ::gentoo while I have it (exact same version) shadowed in an overlay (which is pulled on `emerge XYZ`) ?
T 1568022681 18<Polynomial-C18>	ManDay: usually overlay have precedence over ::gentoo
T 1568022684 18<Polynomial-C18>	*overlays
T 1568022717 18<ManDay18>	Polynomial-C: yes, that's why I don't understand why the -uDN will try to pull it from ::gentoo
T 1568022737 18<redsh18>	The output might help.

T 1568022891 18<redsh18>	Does the overlay mesa not have X in IUSE?
T 1568023394 18<ManDay18>	redsh: There is no overlay mesa
T 1568023402 18<ManDay18>	The overlay is gst-plugins-vaapi
T 1568023411 18<ManDay18>	(which skips the mesa[X(+)])
T 1568023436 18<Polynomial-C18>	ManDay: mask the ::gentoo version and run emerge again.
T 1568023558 18<ManDay18>	Polynomial-C: Then it directly goes to pull the overlay version.
T 1568023567 18<ManDay18>	Is that a bug in the resolver perhaps?
T 1568023592 18<Polynomial-C18>	ManDay: perhaps the overlay has lower priority.
T 1568023596 18<lg18818>	I'm using xfce which uses exo-open to launch a file. but for some reason it defaults to xterm.
T 1568023626 18<ManDay18>	Polynomial-C: If that were so, wouldn't `emerge gst-plugins-vaapi` also resort to ::gentoo?
T 1568023630 18<lg18818>	I'm using `/usr/bin/kitty "%s"` as the command to replace it (in the GUI)
T 1568023647 18<lg18818>	but for some reason it defaults to the wrong emulator
T 1568023684 18<lg18818>	I can get it to run just fine with `exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator`
T 1568023693 18<lg18818>	but the moment I add a file, it bugs out
T 1568024321 18<spacedust18>	can i set up /etc/conf.d/net to use dhcp for an interface but leave ipv6 out ?
T 1568024328 18<spacedust18>	i dont want it to configure a ipv6
T 1568024476 18<yabobay18>	is it possible to install gentoo with only one partition? im using MBR, and i wont be doing Swap partition
T 1568024488 18<DrEeevil18>	mostly yes
T 1568024495 18<DrEeevil18>	as long as your bootloader can find a kernel ...
T 1568024521 18<yabobay18>	because on the handbook it says i need multiple partitions to get a bootloader
T 1568024659 18<ManDay18>	spacedust: Up to the configuration of your dhcp client, I'd say.
T 1568024679 18<ManDay18>	dhcpcd, for instance, has "ipv4/6" config entries.
T 1568024680 18<spacedust18>	ManDay: i see, where to set that ? is there a dhcp_ens3="-param" ?
T 1568024695 18<spacedust18>	im not sure which one im using, for now i switch to static :)
T 1568024697 18<spacedust18>	just rebooting
T 1568024721 18<spacedust18>	aaaaah ipv6 its there ....

T 1568024785 18<spacedust18>	so if i dont explicitly say what ipv6 i want it will use dhcp ?
T 1568024803 18<spacedust18>	ManDay: i am using dhcpcd
T 1568024807 18<ManDay18>	can't parse your question
T 1568024816 18<spacedust18>	or am i ? :) i have dhcp and dhcpcd package as well
T 1568024822 18<spacedust18>	so now which one will netifrc use ?
T 1568024838 18<ManDay18>	netifrc is a mystery to me...
T 1568024882 18<ManDay18>	you can just try dhcpcd
T 1568024955 18<spacedust18>	how ?
T 1568024962 18<spacedust18>	how to set up dhcpcd to use only ipv4 ?
T 1568024998 18<ManDay18>	I would *think* that dhcpcd.conf would help with that, but then again I'm not sure how netifrc invokes dhcpcd
T 1568025019 18<ManDay18>	but I think dhcpcd.conf should at least be worth a try
T 1568025087 18<ManDay18>	(i.e. noipv6)
T 1568025115 18<ManDay18>	netifrc might still try to set up a linklocal adress, though
T 1568025166 18<spacedust18>	/etc/conf.d/dhcpd:# DHCPD_OPTS=""
T 1568025168 18<spacedust18>	-4

T 1568025187 18<ManDay18>	yeah, then there are these conf.d entries...
T 1568025188 18<BtbN18>	dhcpcd is not responsible for IPv6. The Kernel takes care of that on its own mostly.
T 1568025205 18<spacedust18>	crossing fingers, rebooting :)
T 1568025232 18<spacedust18>	BtbN: well i definitly get a route, so im 100% sure the kernel does not get a route by itself so its dhcp doing that im sure
T 1568025245 18<BtbN18>	It totaly is able to get a route on its own, yes.
T 1568025248 18<ManDay18>	spacedust: never underestimate the kernel features :-D
T 1568025252 18<BtbN18>	IPv6 does not need DHCP for that
T 1568025261 18<BtbN18>	It doesn't need DHCP at all, actually.
T 1568025265 18<ManDay18>	just read menuconfig for an idea of v6-features
T 1568025267 18<BtbN18>	RA handles everything it needs.
T 1568025273 18<spacedust18>	BtbN: oh cool :) i forget how many cool features ipv6 has :)
T 1568025295 18<BtbN18>	I think the only thing the Kernel can't do entirely on its own is setting DNS servers, but that's about it.
T 1568025299 18<spacedust18>	BtbN: so how to tell not to do it, i want to set up ipv6 later but want ipv4 via dhcp or static
T 1568025334 18<spacedust18>	BtbN: indeed its not dhcpcd i just rebooted with the -4 setting and the rest and still getting ipv6 :)
T 1568025357 18<Kangie18>	spacedust, take ipv6 out of your kernel?
T 1568025380 18<BtbN18>	There's a sysctl setting to turn off RA on an interface
T 1568025384 18<BtbN18>	But why do you even want that?
T 1568025386 18<ManDay18>	Kangie: he said he wants to set it up later

T 1568027779 18<redsh18>	spacedust: And i.e `curl v6.ident.me` works and shows you your IPv6 address?
T 1568027806 18<freakynl18>	Some people, incorrectly, seem to think that NAT is the firewall. It's the stateful inspection part that's the firewall (and yes, that can apply NAT, but it's not necessary for the stateful part at all). Just get a stateful firewall and route IPv6, using NAT on it is riduculous.

T 1568028976 18<ryao18>	spacedust: If your VM is doing NAT, then enabling that on it probably isn't needed. Wait.. what kind of tunnel is this? If it the HE tunnel broker, then it cannot be behind NAT.
T 1568028990 18<grawity18>	so if the VM is behind NAT (e.g. the host is NATing), then the host needs a DNAT rule for this
T 1568029004 18<grawity18>	(I almost said "port forwarding rule" but technically this thing has no ports, it's just protocol 41)

T 1568029503 18<spacedust18>	here is different a bit its just the host doing the nat for the vm
T 1568029523 18<spacedust18>	i guess something its blocking it, either a firewall or this forwarding setting or something
T 1568029526 18<grawity18>	do you have control of the host's iptables rules?
T 1568029542 18<spacedust18>	HE tunnel broker definitly works behind nat, you just change the local ip to the lan ip
T 1568029544 18<grawity18>	and, well, use tcpdump and investigate instead of guessing

T 1568029582 18<grawity18>	if the host is NATing your regular TCP and UDP traffic, that should mean its IP-forward settings are just fine

T 1568031693 18<redsh18>	No, it's probably because you aren't forwarding protocol 41.

T 1568031698 18<grawity18>	ryao: most Linux-based ones do, since it doesn't even involve a protocol module... it's unfortunate that most routers don't expose it in the UI for configuring static rules though

T 1568031770 18<grawity18>	spacedust: but it *might be* that your tunnel is working fine but the "default" default route points to native v6

T 1568155128 18<iamben18>	you either need a new static+suid sudo binary, or you'd have to modify the library path for sudo which im pretty sure is not "legal"
T 1568155130 18<tdr18>	tlhonmey, i mean, can you see your bootloader etc?

T 1568155206 18<tlhonmey18>	I think it's glibc that listens to LD_PRELOAD
T 1568155213 18<Xelnor18>	tlhonmey: you could have a shell as root but no binary working
T 1568155219 18<tdr18>	tlhonmey, if you're going to remove puppet-master, make them boot livemedia

T 1568155316 18<tdr18>	tlhonmey, for many things yes you could.  if it's pain to handle stuff with, consider putitng a "safe" boot option in your grub, a known-good bootable iso or small little partition with basic os, enough to get you booted so you can fix your other one

T 1568155475 18<tlhonmey18>	tdr: all I need is enough root to copy a few library files.  Busybox would be enough.
T 1568155475 18<Xelnor18>	tdr: if busybox is alive, and network open, you can use `busybox netcat` to fetch binaries :)
T 1568155506 18<tlhonmey18>	Yeah, I've done that.  I just can't get enough privileges to do anything with them...
T 1568155518 18<tlhonmey18>	Maybe I can convince it to mount something with a setuid version of busybox...

T 1568162623 18<wraeth18>	_Cute_Kitty_: Before deleting your htdocs, you should probably copy your owncloud config.php so you don't have to write it again. Also, owncloud is an application that is run by the webserver. The webserver runs as a user (in your case, probably "apache") on the machine. Users in owncloud are unrelated to users on the system - owncloud (and, by extension, the web server) is what does stuff on the machine on behalf of the user in owncloud.

T 1568163043 18<kerframil18>	the trick now is to find out what owncloud complains about, identify either the directory being referred to - or the directory in which it is trying to create a directory - then "chown apache" each on a case-by-case basis.

T 1568163219 18<kerframil18>	one is to create that exact path as a directory then chown it for apache. or, you could be a bit more liberal an chown apache its parent ("cloud"), which would allow it to create apps-external as a sub-directory anyway.
T 1568163278 18<_Cute_Kitty_18>	i think i should just chown the cloud folder
T 1568163284 18<_Cute_Kitty_18>	is that what you're saying with the second option
T 1568163312 18<kerframil18>	yes. it's less secure but, as you are troubleshooting and it is not known which other directory will be created, it's not necessarily unreasonable.
T 1568163318 18<kerframil18>	directories, even.

T 1568295831 18<iamben18>	some of those targets are stable-masked, so enabling them requires some advanced setup (if you're on stable)

T 1568297067 18<iamben18>	share the output if you're not sure, very often those 'multiple versions in one slot' conflicts are red herrings and there's a more urgent problem elsewhere in the output

T 1568298092 18<iamben18>	at first glance it looks like your entry for dev-qt/designer may be restricted to 5.12.4 only, but it could be some other things
T 1568298114 18<petaflot18>	I am playing with the backtrack options. sure: http://dpaste.com/1WCEPC1
T 1568298149 18<iamben18>	yeah as i suspected
T 1568298176 18<iamben18>	1) you probably should be using stable qt unless you have a good reason  2) if you allow unstable, you need to be more thorough, possibly with a wildcard entry
T 1568298223 18<petaflot18>	if I remember well, I had to go through this because of qt with python 3.7
T 1568298246 18<iamben18>	maybe you shouldn't have enabled 3.7 globally, but only on packages where you need it
T 1568298256 18<iamben18>	were you specifically doing development for PyQt5 on python 3.7?
T 1568298266 18<petaflot18>	yep :-/
T 1568298275 18<iamben18>	maybe you should be on full unstable
T 1568298351 18<iamben18>	anyway you have MOST of the qt collection allowing unstable >=5.11.0 then a handful allowing only =5.12.4, this is a problem now that 5.12.5 is latest unstable
T 1568298432 18<petaflot18>	iamben: I replaced all 5.12.4 by 5.12.5
T 1568298447 18<iamben18>	that will be a problem again when the next version is out
T 1568298478 18<petaflot18>	do you suggest I should accept >=5.12 for all?
T 1568298500 18<iamben18>	that's mostly meaningless, you may as well use unversioned entries if you're going that route
T 1568298522 18<petaflot18>	that makes sense
T 1568298523 18<iamben18>	you could replace them all with a single entry "dev-qt/*" to allow any unstable ever
T 1568298548 18<iamben18>	or you could use "dev-qt/*:5/5.12" to allow all 5.12 versions but not allow unstable 5.13 or 5.14 when they hit
T 1568298552 18<petaflot18>	oh, I didn't know I could use wildcards on the packages
T 1568298567 18<iamben18>	wildcard usage is limited but it can be used for this particular case
T 1568298572 18<petaflot18>	:-)
T 1568298614 18<iamben18>	eg you can't mix wildcards with version (dev-qt/*-5.12.5 is invalid) but you can use it with slots
T 1568298776 18<petaflot18>	I am still quite unfamiliar with slots and how they work
T 1568298822 18<iamben18>	you can check (eg) "eshowkw qtcore" output to see what versions are available and which ones are stable/unstable and which ones are in what slot
T 1568298848 18<petaflot18>	so if I understand well, "dev-qt/*:5/5.12" means for all packages in dev-qt/ for the "version 5 slot" accept all 5.12 versions?
T 1568298860 18<iamben18>	the slot is literally 5/5.12
T 1568298871 18<iamben18>	5.11 versioned were in 5/5.11 slot
T 1568298902 18<iamben18>	this is specific to how qt does its slots, most other packages won't work this way.  but that's why you shoudl use eshowkw to see what the slots look like.
T 1568298981 18<petaflot18>	this is nice :-) however I'm not quite sure how to make sense of the eapi/unused/slot columns
T 1568299018 18<iamben18>	that's fine, i don't see any reason to worry about eapi & unused in this current discussion =)
T 1568299093 18<josef6418>	dev-qt/qtsql has a different subslot
T 1568299126 18<iamben18>	hmm that throws a wrench into our spokes

T 1568351834 18<wraeth18>	mint: Portage, the package manager, uses ebuilds which act as a description of how the system builds and installs the package. The ebuild describes things like how to call make or whichever build tooling is required. 'emerge' is the CLI interface to Portage. You run emerge, portage looks at the ebuild, the ebuild says "i need $these installed as dependencies, and then run $some_commands to build and install the package", and so it does that.

T 1568626702 18<oc2k1_18>	running emerge in parallel works in some cases, but if both commands have the same dependencies it will emerge the dependencies multiple times....

T 1568729539 18<CMoH18>	grknight, thanks - getting the hint that there are two separate ways of using the system unlocked my thoughts
T 1568729850 18<phiwer18>	I am having some difficulties with my UEFI configuration (fresh install of Gentoo), and my legacy dual-boot legacy BIOS installation. Maybe I am asking for problems using UEFI with a BIOS installation on the side? It certainly seems that way.
T 1568729893 18<iamben18>	phiwer: do you pick one or the other from the UEFI boot menu?
T 1568729945 18<phiwer18>	Long story short: Grub2 installation on my debian/win10 harddrive can boot Gentoo, Debian and Win10. My grub2 UEFI installation on second harddrive now boots into grub2 menu, but it cannot find the kernel (nor can't boot win10; I don't remember the error code, but that OS is not important :) ).
T 1568730023 18<iamben18>	uefi grub won't be able to boot a bios windows
T 1568730045 18<phiwer18>	iamben: If I boot gentoo harddrive (GPT) from boot menu during startup (specifically marked UEFI), then I can load grub, but it won't boot gentoo. Complaining that it can't find the kernel. I've checked UUID in grub.cfg, and they look OK.
T 1568730046 18<iamben18>	you're locked into either UEFI or BIOS mode by the time the bootloader is running
T 1568730080 18<phiwer18>	Ok, that would explain why I can't boot windows, but why can't I boot gentoo?
T 1568730083 18<iamben18>	maybe you can drop to a grub shell and see what the disk layout looks like
T 1568730108 18<iamben18>	especially to see if the disks you need are visible at all
T 1568730116 18<phiwer18>	Yeah I'll need to do that. I just wanted to figure out if I should dump this UEFI business all together (never really worked for me tbh)...
T 1568730177 18<iamben18>	well i dont see any indication that UEFI is to blame yet, but mixing BIOS/UEFI OSes on the same machine is just asking for trouble
T 1568730204 18<iamben18>	i prefer UEFI but if i already had BIOS windows + BIOS debian installed, i'd stick with BIOS for the new gentoo as well
T 1568730205 18<phiwer18>	Yeah that's what I'm thinking as well, after having read some horror stories.
T 1568730229 18<phiwer18>	Yes, that was my thinking as well. I prefer UEFI. But not sure if it's worth the trouble right now.
T 1568730396 18<grawity18>	mixing BIOS and UEFI OSes is a bad idea, but regardless, it *should* technically work
T 1568730566 18<phiwer18>	It seems more trouble than it's worth from what I've read. It's not a must for me to have UEFI right now.

T 1568734486 18<rej18>	grknight: Both are quite old now, and rc_hotplug should be able to do that, too.
T 1568734839 18<iamben18>	mark4: O3 is more likely to expose bugs in your code, especially when relying on undefined behavior.  but it's also true that it can make quite a bit of code run *slower* than it would have with -O2.  those are reasons we recommend global O2, but it doesn't mean that O3 is inherently broken or bad

T 1568747848 18<grknight18>	Jjeje: if you really want to go nuts. look at /usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/portage/emaint/modules/sync/{__init__,sync}.py for examples of how emaint does it
T 1568747925 18<Jjeje18>	thx grknight will take a look, i reading already -> https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/api/module-tree.html

T 1568748008 18<grknight18>	Jjeje: this channel generally doesn't dive into the API.  usually that's for #gentoo-portage
T 1568748058 18<Jjeje18>	ok so i should ask there ?
T 1568748148 18<grknight18>	for further inquires, yes, i would recommend it

T 1568748188 18<ajak18>	is there an easy way to check for installed reverse dependencies?
T 1568748213 18<iamben18>	ajak: emerge -cpv foo    will list installed packages that depend on foo

T 1568753332 18<zxcat18>	nevermind. More questions: as we can use 'euse' to manipulate USE flags without editing directly package.use/* files, is possible to change accept_keywords (~) using a similar approach? ( using some portage tool )
T 1568753760 18<redsh18>	Doesn't euse set global flags, like adding stuff to USE= in make.conf?
T 1568753782 18<iamben18>	possibly flaggie
T 1568753803 18<iamben18>	but they're just text files, you can manipulate with echo/sed/etc
