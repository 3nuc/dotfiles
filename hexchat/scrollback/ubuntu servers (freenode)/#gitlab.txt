T 1568626307 18<D0han18>	you may want to take a look at runner with docker

T 1568710680 20<threenuc>30	In my proposed solution I have two runners on the same machine: shell runner and docker runner. I can't execute it on a docker runner because it will deploy to docker. I want it to deploy to my main machine (docker host). Would that work?

T 1568711244 18<mgolisch18>	you can add additional bind mounts in the runner config file

T 1568712416 18<Toxmi18>	I want to checkout the merge-request to my (private) repo. The gitlab gives me something like this: git fetch "git@gitlab.com:user0005/FGProject.git" "feature_x"

T 1568712522 18<Toxmi18>	yesterday, it was much easier something like 'git fetch origin/sth`.
T 1568712538 18<Toxmi18>	I don't know what the problem is or how to debug it.
T 1568717658 18<andi_18>	hello i've got a question regarding git submodules... i have a repo, lets call it "code" in this repo i've got a .gitlab-ci.yml running. in this gitlab-ci.yml i want to import/call/use another git repo within the same server. so i created a .gitmodules file and added the repo i need. where is this repo if i start a new ci/cd runner?
T 1568717851 18<andi_18>	i also cannot see a Cloning repository in my runner log
T 1568718050 18<andi_18>	what i am expecting is a folder inside my code runner working dir.. something like code/pulled_submodule
T 1568718608 18<mgolisch18>	https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/git_submodules.html#using-git-submodules-in-your-ci-jobs
T 1568718631 18<mgolisch18>	looks like you need to tell the runner to checkout the submodules for you
T 1568718797 18<Toxmi18>	Considerning this scenario, there is a private repo with an owner and a developer. The developer fork the repo and create a feature locally then push it back to his own forked repo which then he fill a merge request.
T 1568718836 18<Toxmi18>	Now the owner, wants to checkout the merge request. However, this doesn't work with the command generated by gitlab (git fetch git@user/....).
T 1568718897 18<Toxmi18>	I don't know if this is a standard practice or not. But the workflow is the above mentioned scenario however, I can not checkout the merge-requests locally on my repo.
T 1568718930 18<mgolisch18>	does your user have access to said repo?
T 1568718931 18<Toxmi18>	As far as I get it, I should do `git fetch origin`, then checkout to origin/the_mr_feature. Right?
T 1568718952 18<Toxmi18>	mgolisch:No, but the user is a member of owner's repo.
T 1568718984 18<Toxmi18>	So you mean the developer which have forked the repo, it should give access to owner as well.
T 1568719459 18<Toxmi18>	It's not the permission problem. Since using  adding this to origin config: fetch = +refs/merge-requests/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/merge-requests/*
T 1568719478 18<Toxmi18>	Now I can checkout those merges. But withotu it I can not. So this is not permission problem.
T 1568719506 18<Toxmi18>	*checkout those merge-requests
T 1568719635 18<Toxmi18>	So based on a #git user, the problem is probably due to some reason which Gitlab doesn't advertise the merge-requests or git fetch the repo doesn't check the merge-requests branches.
T 1568719810 18<andi_18>	mgolisch: where do i add the line? git@gitlab.com:secret-group/my-project.git
T 1568719838 18<andi_18>	or in other words, where do i tell the runner to check out the repo?
T 1568719924 18<andi_18>	do i add a git clone in the before_script?
T 1568722416 18<andi_18>	how do i add the ssh-key created for the gitlab-runner user to the gitlab server?
T 1568722425 18<andi_18>	where do i need to copy the .pub to?
T 1568722687 18<badeball18>	My impression is that stages / jobs is a merely a constrained DAG, which can be achieved using exactly that. Why would one use needs: togeether with stage: ? As indicated here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/issues/65504/designs

T 1568747177 18<ahf18>	we can create the user via the API if that is needed for this to happen, even without the default sign up page for a public instance.
T 1568747186 18<ahf18>	i just cannot see any kind of moderation features anywhere
T 1568747292 18<ahf18>	one option i could see would be to have a different form where the user when writing their first ticket does it via a form that uses the api to: 1) create the user account with the email they specify in the form and 2) create the issue, with the confidential bit set, with the newly created user
