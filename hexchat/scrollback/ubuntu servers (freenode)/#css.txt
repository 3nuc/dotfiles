T 1568294705 18<Selvvir18>	hmw_metalab, Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
T 1568294717 18<hmw_metalab18>	^ truth

T 1568294761 18<stennowork18>	people should really internalize what HTML is supposed to do and what CSS is supposed to do
T 1568294767 18<stennowork18>	then you can't even have 'divitis'

T 1568294920 18<feelextra18>	what technical difference does it make?
T 1568294925 18<stennowork18>	feelextra, semantics
T 1568294928 18<stennowork18>	HTML is semantic
T 1568294937 18<lilltiger18>	feelextra: readability, so much easier to see the layout of the page then with just a bunch of div
T 1568294940 18<stennowork18>	so a screen reader, for example, has some hints
T 1568294943 18<feelextra18>	these semantics aren't being processed any differently by the client
T 1568294949 18<stennowork18>	feelextra, false
T 1568294949 18<hmw_metalab18>	feelextra: You are less likely to use non-semantic class names like "top-area" or "green-leftalign-text"
T 1568294972 18<feelextra18>	stennowork: what's a screen reader? is that a software?
T 1568294990 18<thykka18>	using only divs is like writing everything on a post-it note. using semantic elements is where you write events into a calendar, greetings into a postcard and resignation letters onto a formal letter
T 1568294993 18<stennowork18>	feelextra, yes, a software for people who have impaired sight
T 1568295032 18<feelextra18>	stennowork: so your point for using semantics is actually for accessibility concerns?
T 1568295039 18<stennowork18>	among others, yes
T 1568295060 18<stennowork18>	its one of the arguments for a semantic markup which is strictly seperated from styling (like in html5)
T 1568295066 18<hmw_metalab18>	my approach is some sort of a role play; The first actor is the author, who writes a text, just like in Notepad, but they put the "hyper" in the text: Marking pieces for what they are: Headings, explanations, citations, listings, etc. Then the Designer takes over and isn't allowed to add any HTML. They have to do everything in CSS.
T 1568295082 18<hmw_metalab18>	Following semantic standartds will also automatically help you avoid certain mistakes
T 1568295100 18<stennowork18>	yes - HTML has NO information about actual styling
T 1568295118 18<lilltiger18>	feelextra: accessibillity and readability for your own sake and other devs that is going to work with the page, esp in months to years time. The better structure the easier to understand and adjust.
T 1568295126 18<hmw_metalab18>	Look at http://www.csszengarden.com/219/ - CSS with semantic HTML may be considert Art
T 1568295137 18<lilltiger18>	well gtg :D
T 1568295157 18<thykka18>	some elements also have specific default styles and/or functionality.. Consider using <dt> and <dd> tags vs. rolling your own expanding element script with div tags..
T 1568295182 18<feelextra18>	lilltiger: ok i guess for code readability. honestly code sucks for user interfaces so it seems like a low yield effort.
T 1568295187 18<thykka18>	or using <div>1. foo</div><div>2. bar</div> for a numbered list, instead of <ol>
T 1568295202 18<stennowork18>	yet still the default UA stylesheet is a recommendation
T 1568295243 18<hmw_metalab18>	I believe, the majority of benefits in sticking to semantics these days lie with keeping your code well organized, clean and therefore small, fast and efficient.
T 1568295288 18<thykka18>	users with screenreaders would disagree. after all, we don't make these sites for ourselves and other developers, but for the users that actually use the site
T 1568295306 18<hmw_metalab18>	Also, imagine you have to program some server side thing that spits out HTML with a lot of layout mixed in and then, a few years later, your boss wants the page to look totally different. If you messed up, you have to refactor EVERYTHING. If done properly, only a new CSS file does the trick. Also, you can provide alternate style sheets for a page. See CSS Zen Garden
T 1568295306 18<thykka18>	or at least we SHOULDN'T be making them for ourselves...
T 1568295350 18<feelextra18>	thykka: yea there are two reasons i've gathered here so far. my last reply only addressed the "code readability" argument.
T 1568295403 18<feelextra18>	"accessibility" is the other argument for semantic elements. sure if the software people are using detects these elements and gives them meanings then that has clear value to users.

T 1568296164 18<hmw_metalab18>	LOL @ a video about vscode, I am watching right now. It opens, how to set it up in a way, that "no addon can steal your CPU and you are always able to save and restart the IDE"
T 1568296228 18<thykka18>	wouldn't the solution be just; don't install a crapton of addons?
