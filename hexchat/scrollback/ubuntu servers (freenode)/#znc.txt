T 1567255919 18<extrowerk18>	A quick question: znc configured to use ssl, but now i want to disable it. i can't seem to find any way at the webadmin. How can i do that?
T 1567259460 18<Khaytsus18>	Someone in another channel is saying he has utf8 issues, which I think are really his irc client or terminal...  but now that I'm looking, what is really reocmmended for the client encoding? Mine is apparently set to the default, "don't ensure any encoding" 
T 1567262506 18<LouWestin18>	I use MIRC with whatever defaults and a iPhone app. 
T 1567262521 18<LouWestin18>	Palaver
T 1567262617 18<Lartza18>	Khaytsus, utf8, I thought this discussion ended years ago :/
T 1567262673 18<Lartza18>	I think I have ZNC setup to read ISO-8859-15 aswell because ugh but I'd rather not
T 1567262922 18<Khaytsus18>	I'm pretty sure his utf8 issues have nothing to do with znc.  It just make me curious what that setting should be.  It seems to default to "dont' ensure" but the second one is marked as recomended, which converts a non-utf8 string into another encoding.
T 1567269552 18<JackK18>	I'm trying to set ZNC back up..  I was using an older version 1.6.something I think.  I had a pretty detailed config which I'm trying to use, rather than recreating everything.
T 1567269582 18<JackK18>	I'm using ZNC 1.7.2+deb3 now..  Before I was able to list all of the networks/channels at the same time, separated by networks.  Now I have to jumpnetwork.  Any idea how to get that back?
T 1567269600 18<JackK18>	so they're all displayed at the same time and I can cycle through them?
T 1567270849 18<JackK18>	Aha.. it was my weechat config.
T 1567271457 18<jrmu18>	can i put a reverse proxy in front of znc? to avoid having to run znc as root since port 443 is privileged
T 1567271749 18<jrmu18>	ok i got it set up using relayd, nvm, thanks all
T 1567273223 18<kylef18>	LouWestin: Palaver uses UTF-8, you can override it with custom encoding via /set irc.network.<name of network>.decode_charset (encode is separate option)
T 1567273407 18<kylef18>	jrmu: you can also use CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to allow the process to bind to small ports 
T 1567273433 18<jrmu18>	ah, I ended up using a reverse proxy
T 1567273446 18<jrmu18>	CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, is that some linux specific setting? i'm running on openbsd
T 1567273519 18<kylef18>	Oh right yeah, not sure what equivalent on OpenBSD will be if any 
T 1567273538 18<kylef18>	Thereâ€™s also identserver, was considering doing something similar in ZNC I run 
T 1567273640 18<jrmu18>	ah, i ended up setting it up with oidentd
T 1567273677 18<jrmu18>	i'd like to eventually use the identd that comes with openbsd, but it'll take some modding of the code
T 1567273794 18<LouWestin18>	Kylef: Ok. I didnâ€™t mess with anything 
T 1567276652 18<MrAureliusR18>	heh, I just used 8080 as my port. guess I am just lazy :P

T 1568301006 18<psychon18>	corner_cubicle: I would expect that you just need TLS 1.3 support in libssl and nothing special in znc
T 1568303260 18<kylef18>	psychon: won't some of the logic at https://github.com/jimloco/Csocket/blob/e8d9e0bb248c521c2c7fa01e1c6a116d929c41b4/Csocket.cc#L1652 need updating?
T 1568303285 18<kylef18>	I guess the default falls through and supports TLS 1.3
T 1568303656 18<psychon18>	what the heck is that O.o
T 1568303712 18<psychon18>	anyway, by default SSLv23_method() / TLS_method() negotiate the supported protocol version with the other end and then use the highest supported version
T 1568303763 18<psychon18>	https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version.html says "Setting the minimum or maximum version to 0, will enable protocol versions down to the lowest version, or up to the highest version supported by the library, respectively."
T 1568303772 18<psychon18>	and the code you linked to defaults to using 0 as the version
T 1568303789 18<psychon18>	so this should be fine, but the code needs changing if one wants to force TLS 1.3
