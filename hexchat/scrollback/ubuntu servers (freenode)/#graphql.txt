T 1567522529 18<_xor18>	So, quick question/feedback...
T 1567522638 18<_xor18>	I'm using an API server that has an authentication mutation which returns a JWT (token) on success.
T 1567522658 18<_xor18>	The token is a base64-encoded JSON object that conforms to a specific structure.
T 1567522704 18<_xor18>	Now, the schema that is returned by the API server says that the type of the value returned from that authentication mutation is a specific object type (Jwt) that's also defined there.
T 1567522719 18<_xor18>	However, when executing the mutation, the returned value is that base64-encoded string.
T 1567522763 18<_xor18>	My question is: Is the API server in the wrong here or does the GraphQL spec leave it open as to how the returned value is to be interpreted by the client?
T 1567522805 18<_xor18>	The assumption that this API server is making is that the client(s) will automatically decode that base64-encoded string & return the Jwt object for use.
T 1567522824 18<_xor18>	That seems...wrong.  The API server is returning a value that doesn't actually conform to what the schema actually says.

T 1567535372 18<r29v18>	I don't think that's according to spec.
T 1567535401 18<r29v18>	You shouldn't remove a field if the user is not authenticated. It should ether return an empty object or be removed from the response entirely.
T 1567535426 18<r29v18>	The query shape should match the response shape
T 1567535871 18<Jemt18>	Well, the API expose the same functions/fields, always. But createUser(..) won't work if you are not authorized. But specifying :User as return type would imply that I either return Null or a User - but an error is thrown if the user is unauthorized, so that wouldn't be accurate either.
T 1567535898 18<r29v18>	is createUser a mutation or a query?
T 1567535903 18<Jemt18>	Mutation
T 1567535907 18<r29v18>	Oh
T 1567535932 18<Jemt18>	I might use incorrect terms here btw. I'm new to GraphQL
T 1567535934 18<r29v18>	yeah I wouldn't put the bang on it unless it's returned all the time.
T 1567535971 18<Jemt18>	Okay. Thanks.
T 1567536007 18<Jemt18>	Is there something like JSDoc for GraphQL schemas allow me to describe the API in more detail ?
T 1567536032 18<r29v18>	https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/
