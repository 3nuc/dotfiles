T 1567245148 18<luc418>	Hello! When I build plasma with kdesrc-build and I run it through sddm, will it use my home to save settings right? I ask this cause I did it accidentally and it broke my installation :-) can I set that installation to use a different home?

T 1567248367 18<meven[m]18>	luc4:AFAIK it was possible maybe using KDEHOME and tweaking session startup scritp plasma-dev-prefix.sh, perhaps the simplest way would be to create another user
T 1567248566 18<meven[m]18>	luc4: https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_System_Administration/KDE_Filesystem_Hierarchy mentions this and although it is no very actual, I think it mostly stands
T 1567248744 18<vkrause18>	apol[m]: nicofee: wondering if we should maybe have an Android BoF too?
T 1567248770 18<nicofee18>	Makes sense
T 1567248798 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	brute4s99: What does it fix/change?
T 1567248871 18<frinring18>	vkrause: hi. perhaps you or someone can tell: does qt allow to build it without deprecated versions? and if so, where does it store the information, so when parsing headers the right deprecated methods are filtered?
T 1567248908 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	And merge request welcome: https://invent.kde.org/websites/aether-sass/blob/master/css/includes/mediawiki.scss
T 1567248912 18<frinring18>	without deprecated versions -> API / symbols I mean
T 1567248952 18<frinring18>	meven[m]: that is sadly kde4 info. for qt5-based software things have been switched to use xdg paths and env vars
T 1567249038 18<vkrause18>	frinring: good question, maybe as part of the interface compile definitions in the cmake config?
T 1567249039 18<frinring18>	meven[m]: so this looks better: https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_System_Administration/XDG_Filesystem_Hierarchy
T 1567249156 18<frinring18>	vkrause: asking, as I have a first working prototype to add same fine-grained deprecated symbols control for KF (via ECM macro, so others can enjoy as well ;) ). one goal to achieve: allow to build all kf modules without deprecated API to a defined version
T 1567249206 18<frinring18>	that should help kf-bundling apps a bit perhaps. at least help to prepare better for Qt6-triggered KF NG :)
T 1567249209 18<[ade]18>	but that is some serious magic if you can (a) remove the declarations from the headers and (b) remove the symbols from the objects
T 1567249235 18<vkrause18>	nicofee: scheduling-wise I think that either means Wed morning (collision with kwin), or Thu afternoon or later
T 1567249298 18<nicofee18>	I don't really need to go to KWin
T 1567249300 18<frinring18>	[ade]: it's more ifdef of the sources as well, no objects touched.
T 1567249354 18<nicofee18>	But apol might want to attend the kwin BoF?
T 1567249366 18<vkrause18>	frinring: yep, seen that, certainly useful infrastructure to have :)
T 1567249469 18<nicofee18>	vkrause: but Thursday afternoon should be fine
T 1567249745 18<vkrause18>	nicofee: ok, added for Thu 16:30
T 1567253210 18<luc418>	meven[m]: yes, using another user is what I currently do. I thought it could be more comfortable not to have to switch user for developing.
T 1567253220 18<luc418>	meven[m]: however thanks for the link.
T 1567255011 18<vkrause18>	nicofee: didn't realize the parking thing had pkpass files, the sample you send me Wednesday doesn't have that though, does it?
T 1567255032 18<nicofee18>	It has a link
T 1567255070 18<vkrause18>	ah, I don't click links in sample data, too much risk I accidentally change/cancel a booking ;-)
T 1567255097 18<nicofee18>	I can send you the file
T 1567255312 18<vkrause18>	seems to render correctly at least, nice given the super small test set for event pkpass files so far :)
T 1567272735 18<brute4s9918>	[ade] CarlSchwan[m]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Table_of_contents#Auto-numbering : I'd like to have the option to remove auto-numbering fir my docs page :)

T 1567506550 18<sitter18>	the wording isn't quite clear. the sha1's of the tags are locked down, the tags aren't actually pushed until release day because they may change if a respin is required to move the tag to a different sha

T 1567521689 18<gwm[m]18>	Is variable shadowing acceptable in KDE's codebase (taking into account that shadowed varible isn't used after it is shaded), or should I avoid it if I want to submit a patch?
T 1567522537 18<thiago18>	avoid if you can if it's in a .cpp; avoid it in a .h
T 1567522839 18<gwm[m]18>	Thanks for the answer. (it's a .cpp file)
T 1567522841 18<gwm[m]18>	Well, the problem is I can't come up with a good VariableNameThatIsNotAwfullyLong and the variables (the original and the shadowed one) are used in almost identical way.
T 1567522841 18<gwm[m]18>	Is leaving it as it is,so reviewers can change it a good idea?
T 1567524721 18<leinir18>	gwm[m]: Will it make people do a double take when the code is looked at again in five years, and after it has been moved around so git blame doesn't show why it happened?
T 1567524902 18<gwm[m]18>	Well, honestly, no idea...
T 1567524902 18<gwm[m]18>	Anyway, I've already submitted a patch, so hopefully I'll get corrected in case it is really bad.

T 1567685064 18<vkrause[m]18>	Carl Schwan: I think that's because it has no times associated with it
T 1567685090 18<vkrause[m]18>	ie. this is likely a boarding pass found by the generic extractor, with no existing booking in the calendar
T 1567685111 18<vkrause[m]18>	so it doesn't know where to actually put it in the calendar
T 1567685130 18<vkrause[m]18>	(the underlying problem is that the barcodes in a standard boarding pass contain only the date, not the times)
T 1567685211 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	vkrause:  Ok so I think I will need to attend the itinerary bof 😉
T 1567685238 18<vkrause[m]18>	definitely, we have no samples for Luxair yet :)
T 1567685333 18<[ade]18>	only got deutsche bahn and trenitalia for you this time, boring stuff.
T 1567685466 18<vkrause[m]18>	not at all, the trenitialia barcodes still have some unknown parts in them, more samples will hopefully help to decode those :)
T 1567685526 18<vkrause[m]18>	and international DB tickets are also very interesting for the still fairly new generic extractor for the standard EU international tickets
T 1567685552 18<vkrause[m]18>	ie. more samples are always helpful
T 1567685568 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	Do you want some blablacar sample?

T 1567685580 18<vkrause[m]18>	the answer is always yes :)
T 1567685594 18<vkrause[m]18>	blablacar I think I only have one, not enough for an extractor yet
T 1567685634 18<vkrause[m]18>	flixbus has structured annotations, but without timezones IIRC, so those will also still need work
T 1567685678 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	Should I send all those samples to an email address?
T 1567685688 18<vkrause[m]18>	yep, vkrause@kde.org
T 1567685772 18<bshah|matrix18>	I'm curious, if everyone sends you their booking, don't you end up with all of that entries in your itinerary app?
T 1567685791 18<bshah|matrix18>	Of course you can kill it later 
T 1567685811 18<vkrause[m]18>	that's why I have never implemented the often requested automatic adding :)

T 1567685866 18<vkrause[m]18>	but it does happen occasioanlly nevertheless, and I notice when my weather forecast doesn't match reality at all ;-)
T 1567686165 18<einar77_work18>	vkrause[m]: currently for non-tickets (e.g. reservation mails) does the whole thing only look for json-ld?
T 1567686356 18<vkrause[m]18>	it also looks if it has a custom extractor script that claims it supports this email (typically by matching the From header)
T 1567686404 18<vkrause[m]18>	it doesn't search emails for barcode image attachments yet though, it only does that in PDF or pkpass attachments
T 1567686483 18<vkrause[m]18>	it does support inline microdata schema.org though, next to json-ld, in HTML parts
T 1567686550 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	vkrause: I send some sample for flixbus.de and blablacar.fr. For blablacar I have a lot more emails if you want.
T 1567686991 18<vkrause[m]18>	got the two flixbus ones (and they indeed show only an UTC offset, not a proper timezone), not seeing the blablacar one yet
T 1567687149 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	Strange I send the blablacar mails before the flixbus mails
T 1567687224 18<vkrause[m]18>	the flixbus ones show up with their original receiving date (ie. way in the past), so took me a while to find those as well, might be I'm just blind
T 1567687334 18<einar77_work18>	vkrause[m]: some bookings for places I visited in Spain this year had barcodes, unsure what was in the barcode though
T 1567687768 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	vkrause: I send the emails this time as attachment and didn't use the KMail redirect feature. It should be easier to find now. 
T 1567687927 18<vkrause[m]18>	that worked, thanks!
T 1567688205 18<vkrause[m]18>	they look quite messed up, weird encoding, lots of remote content, and in a language I'm not exactly fluent in, might make sense to have a look at this together next week so I properly understand what I'm looking at :)

T 1568029359 18<frinring18>	I guess someone wrote bad code off by one, and then things were "fixed" in the docs ;)
T 1568029417 18<einar77_work18>	informally "up to <version>" would be probably fine but in a macro sounds a little off

T 1568029769 18<frinring18>	my small pain with DISABLE_DEPRECATED_UP_TO is that as developer with a certain version locally I look at that version given backwards mentally

T 1568030823 18<noahdvs[m]118>	Plus it's not radically different from the Qt macro, so people familiar with Qt should understand what it means.

T 1568056412 18<sankasan18>	damn, building a single application using kdesrc-build pulls in _a lot_ of modules. Even after I've disabled Qt I'm still building 77 modules in order to build the application skrooge. It seems excessive for a standalone application. It feels like I'm building a large part from the latest and greatest of the KDE stack in order to build a single application. It is the recommended way from the 'getting involved' pages but it looks like a lot 
T 1568056413 18<sankasan18>	can break when building like this. What is the best way to _only_ build the application I want to improve?
T 1568056522 18<sankasan18>	ah.. "include-dependencies" can be set to off :) (rtfm douchebag)

T 1568058347 18<sankasan18>	yeah, I'm on arch so I guess I'm okay in the rolling release part. And actually I don't mind building a large part of the stack once, but not for every iteration. I'm used to hit F5 almost as often as Control+S :)
T 1568058422 18<ngraham18>	once you build them all once, it's done and rebuilding them is pretty fast FWIW
T 1568058445 18<sankasan18>	well, part of building with kdesrc-build is a sync step if I'm not mistaken
T 1568058467 18<sankasan18>	so every build can pull in a bad submit or a larger rebuild, no?

T 1568059428 18<ngraham18>	no, it is; that's how kdesrc-build knows what to do in fact
T 1568059433 18<ngraham18>	if that didn't work, I'm surprised
T 1568059479 18<ngraham18>	did you check the right log file? kdesrc-build will give you the path to its logs dir, but you kind of have to hunt for it. the CMake output isn't displayed in the console
T 1568059508 18<dfaure[m]18>	the hunt can be simplified to `less log/latest/module/error.log`

T 1568280790 18<dvratil[m]18>	einar77_work: for a library I think it would be best to have it only emit a signal on error and then implement the notification in the app that uses it - for instance in KMail, having a notification for the error makes sense, however in KSieveManager, a messagebox would make more sense, since the context there is clear

T 1568296839 18<frinring18>	krop: hi. would you have an idea how to do tests for ECM which yields test-passed if a compilation fails? asking in context of https://phabricator.kde.org/D23789 . I got some initial test code done to test the positive side (i.e. API is visible), now I wonder how to test that API is invisible :)
T 1568296885 18<krop18>	test pass if failed ? mmm
T 1568296953 18<frinring18>	I wonder if I could make use of cmake's try_compile somehow, but no-one used that so far in ECM, so I have no sample to be inspired from :)
T 1568297016 18<frinring18>	also still having get to used to all those indirect ctest invocations, still a bit lost about the principal testing framework there in ECM

T 1568298267 18<svuorela18>	dfaure[m]: can I exec() on a kiojob before app.exec has been called? 
T 1568298385 18<[ade]18>	dfaure[m]: looking at kcoreaddons, the test failures related to inotify should really end up being unit tests in the underlying library (inotify-compatibility-shim for kevent). Basically it looks like removing a file yields a dirty event on the irectory, but no event directly related to the file that was removed.
T 1568298410 18<[ade]18>	.. it'd be helpful if the tests had a bit more explicit information on what the events should be that are generated.
T 1568300665 18<[ade]18>	kdelibs4support test failure .. I can at least reproduce the failure
T 1568301418 18<[ade]18>	.. but looks more like a failure in kservice than in kdelibs4support :S
T 1568301544 18<cmacq2[m]18>	@frinring: for try_compile try looking at @ivan:kde.org  s work on activities. He likes to try out more modern C++, so has been forced to solve that before. IIRC I once cribbed some cmake magic from his projects like that
T 1568301603 18<frinring18>	cmacq2[m]: thanks. my question though is more about how this fits into the current desgn of the ECM tests, less about how to use it in general
T 1568301629 18<[ade]18>	does kservice not get release tags?
T 1568301672 18<frinring18>	[ade]: it does. cmp. e.g. the list at https://cgit.kde.org/kservice.git
T 1568301747 18<frinring18>	(v6.x.0 only happen at final release day, just like for all kf modules, if that is the question)
T 1568301855 18<[ade]18>	(now you're confusing me by mentioning v6, even) No, it's just my repo only has a handful of old tags, git pull does pull in the most up-to-date code commits, but doesn't update tags
T 1568301944 18<frinring18>	oops, typo :) v5.x.0 of course
T 1568302016 18<frinring18>	[ade]: that is because gt pull will only getch tags part/on of the branches you pull. for tags on commits e.g. off-named branch, like the rc ones, you will need to expliitly pull them
T 1568302031 18<frinring18>	getch = merge of get & fetch ;)
T 1568302095 18<[ade]18>	i wonder why git doesn't update the available tags (i dunno, usually git checkout master ; git pull does the right thing). not that important, since now i've moved on to bugs / test failures in kservice which i think i need to resolve before i can deal with kdelibs4support
T 1568302186 18<frinring18>	because tags would pull in all the commits leading to the commit they are on. which could be a lot and not what you wanted when you pulled the default branch
T 1568302226 18<frinring18>	*pulled a/the current branch
T 1568302899 18<frinring18>	[ade]: so, git pull does bring you all the tags which are on commits of the branch you pulled. but not tags on commits which are off that branch. usually (here: kde plasma, applications) tags are on commits on branches. but for kf, there are no normal branches with branch names, but commit chain "branches" whose heads are referenced by tags. because, they are supposed to be final, no branches where more stuff is pushed to with a moving head
T 1568303103 18<[ade]18>	IOW, rm -rf and re-clone if you want to find tags or branches. 
T 1568303234 18<frinring18>	that's the windows approach ;) git pull --tags e.g. will get you all the tags from the remote repo (and all the commits leading to them)
T 1568303275 18<heirecka18>	fwiw, there's also git fetch --tags
T 1568303327 18<frinring18>	yes, more correct as it does not update current local branch
T 1568303353 18<[ade]18>	dfaure[m]: I get failures in the unittests of kservice on Linux as well :(
T 1568303366 18<[ade]18>	(er .. in the 5.60 version)
T 1568303563 18<frinring18>	meh, IN_LIST is only cmake 3.3
T 1568303610 18<[ade]18>	so that's odd .. the tests succeed on the CI (Linux), fail on my laptop (Linux) and fail on FreeBSD (home workstation  and CI)

T 1568726217 18<dfaure[m]18>	you mean can't? What's that message? A fatal error from kglobalaccel?
T 1568726372 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	it's the message I get then I try to restart kglobalaccel
T 1568726698 18<CarlSchwan[m]18>	ok it looks like an issue with my system ☹️
T 1568728449 18<bcooksley18>	nggraham: thanks for those comments re. that telemetry kcm
T 1568728460 18<bcooksley18>	as it stands, it doesn't really comply with the policy we've laid out...
T 1568728473 18<ngraham18>	my pleasure
T 1568728512 18<ngraham18>	yeah I think before we put this in front of users, the presentation and behavior need to be polished to a mirror sheen or else at best nobody will feel confident enough to enable it, and at worst, it will cause a PR nightmare
T 1568729391 18<bcooksley18>	Oki, i've got the stuff for Flatpaks staged as much as I can
T 1568729412 18<bcooksley18>	annoyingly, I now have to wait for the 100GB repository that has who knows how many inodes in it to sync
T 1568729426 18<bcooksley18>	Flatpak really is not designed to scale at all :(
T 1568729458 18<bcooksley18>	100GB should not take hours to rsync over a gigabit connection with extremely low latency (we're talking 2-3ms tops)
T 1568729526 18<bcooksley18>	What it really needs is something like Git has - packs - to improve compression and reduce the number of files on disk
T 1568729534 18<bcooksley18>	(which should also reduce fetch times)
T 1568731501 18<brute4s9918>	bcooksley: do you know if "fatal: remote error: service not enabled: /craft" is a temporary hiccup or if I'm the one at fault? I'm trying to land D23907
